    <h1>Welcome to the Warrior Cats Play Archive!</h1>
    <p>Warrior Cats Play was a roleplaying website originally started on webs back in 2012, until it was moved to Discord in late 2016. In April 2022, it was slated to be shut down by the original owners, but other members took it upon themselves to continue the roleplaying scene over at Warrior Cats Legacy. This project is a means to archive these old rps that have otherwise been rendered inaccessible, as to preserve the intellectual property of the roleplayers who contributed to our community. This project is not affiliated with Warrior Cats Play, or its owners, but merely created to allow for access to our writing once again.</p>
