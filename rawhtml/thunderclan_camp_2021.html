                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The weather was, at last, getting warmer; the snow was melting, and while it was still quite cold at night, at least the morning and afternoon temperatures were more tolerable, even if it was just the slightest bit. This was her favorite time of year, she had concluded; there was so much fauna to see and she had loved nature since she was only a mere kit. There was something that was utterly lovely about it all, though she didn’t know what it was. She had remembered, when she was a kit, begging and pleading her mother to take her out to the territory just so she could admire it all even more. But to no avail. Now that she was a warrior, though, she could do it whenever she pleased. 

And so she did. Actually, she was just coming back from a walk to do that very thing. The skies were gray, yes, but that didn’t stop her from admiring the trees and nature itself. Actually, the only thing that probably <em>would</em> put a stop to her adventures was rain, so it was probably good that she came home when she did. Her face was worn with scars - the most prominent being one wide one directly under her eye - and her eyes were a deep red and deep blue respectively. These eyes trailed the camp as she looked for someone to talk to, someone she could. . . converse with - and she saw Laurelblaze. Padding over to her, she didn’t utter a greeting but instead she talked about the weather; that was an interesting opener, right?

<em><strong>”Looks like rain might be coming soon, unless these skies carry no promises. Whatever the case, it should be interesting either way.”</strong></em>

Marigolddust stood off to the side of the camp, trying to figure out what exactly he should do in order to keep himself occupied.  He had helped Fernpaw with cleaning up some of her loose herbs that had been picked up by the wind that morning.  It helped him feel better, and it wasn&#39;t too tricky of a job, but he felt that he needed to do something more.  Could he have a break day today?  A day where he didn&#39;t need to worry about hunting by himself or doing solo patrols?  Were those even allowed?  He knew that he needed to likely just sit back and relax, but it was tricky being a new warrior.  He felt that he needed to do something, yet he had nothing to ease that need.  He began to pace back and forth anxiously.  

           Maybe he should just meet more cats.  That way, he could learn more about the cats he was helping and those who he might find himself working with.  Perhaps if he met more cats, then he wouldn&#39;t have to be worried when he interacts with them again and forgets their names.  Although, that might not be the best idea.  Would widening his circle of knowledge of other cats make any difference?  Was hunting or patrolling more important?  <em>You need to learn to relax a bit,</em> he thought quietly to himself.  This would be the perfect chance to do that, right?  Shaking himself, he stopped pacing and let his lemon colored hues graze the surrounding camp.  Not many cats were out so far today, although of the few that weren&#39;t doing work or seeking peace in their dens he spotted another warrior, a warrior possibly older and more experienced than himself.  They could be a good start, right?</span>

Padding up to the stranger cat, Marigolddust gathered his little confidence and organized it into a greeting.  <em><strong><em>&quot;U-um, hello, beautiful weather today, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked, taking notice of the fact that the other cat seemed to be enjoying the new warmth of the coming season.  He felt very awkward, and wanted to fix that feeling, although he couldn&#39;t come up with a way to do so.  Had he started with something weird?  Off?  Rude?  Oh, he sure hoped not, but there was always the possibility.  Maybe he should add something else, something he had heard said more often.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I... don&#39;t think I recognize you?  I&#39;m Marigolddust,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, hoping that the statement would restore him to a bit of a more relaxed start.  It didn&#39;t come as a surprise to himself that he didn&#39;t recognize the cat.  He rarely recognized anyone in the clan, only if he was close to the cat, they had some sort of impact on his life, or they were a highrank.  He hoped that this cat expected it, to, and wouldn&#39;t mind it as much as Marigolddust did.</span>

The friendly response helped to ease some of the uneasy nerves that had bristled his fur just a few seconds before.  Now, he felt a bit more comfortable.  Although, he felt a little nervous about the fact that he didn&#39;t know what to say next.  What could he say to continue the conversation?  Did this cat want a conversation?  Well, it didn&#39;t seem like the other cat minded it at all, and Marigolddust found himself wanting to try and continue it himself, so maybe he should try and carry it for the moment.  How he would manage to keep it afloat along with the other tom was a mystery to him, but he decided that he should just try and jump into it.  He would... <em>hopefully</em> figure it out.  
            Marigolddust nodded with the agreement.  Deciding that he knew what he should say next, he sat down, hoping that the position would make him feel more sure in himself.  <em><strong><em>&quot;So, what&#39;s your name?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked quietly, curious and nervous at the same time, although as he took note of before, he was much less anxious than he had been before.

This rain was but a prelude to what was to come, though the deputy was still not a fan of it. Gradually it would become more intense as it reached it’s prime, how some cats actually liked these storms was beyond her understanding... This was coming from a cat who enjoyed throwing herself into the lake in greenleaf when it got a little too hot for her liking. Some things were different depending on the situation. She just was not a fan of cold rain, nor this weird time of year. She liked it better when it was a little bit warmer and when it was sunny, though leaf-fall was her favorite time of year. The endless stream of warm colors, and the refreshingly crisp air that put an end to an oppressive heat wave. A perfect season for her, even if it was leading into the hardest season of all, leaf-bare. Being a longer-furred individual made her partial towards the colder seasons, where she was more comfortable in her own pelt. <strong>”Too late, it’s already begun.”</strong> the deputy mused aloud, her heterochromatic gaze shifting back up to the silvery skies. Her ears flickered for a moment, she realized the cat that had approached her was one of her clanmates that she wasn’t very well acquainted with— Blurryowl. Straightening her posture, the tortoiseshell dipped her head in greeting after her statement.</span>

The russet-toned, dappled femora hadn’t really gotten the chance to speak with this particular clanmate of hers before. While she did know her name and what she looked like, that was about all the knowledge she had about her. Surface value, essential information, she made it a habit to know everyone by name so she’d keep up with any issues the clan may be having. Plus she always made sure everyone was in their nest at night, wanting to keep tabs on everyone just to make sure no one was missing or in danger. She tended to be a bit paranoid about the safety of her clanmates and if they were remaining that way. Laurelblaze took her duties seriously, and that included the sanctity of the clan and all of it’s members.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The mere idea of making small talk with the newest generations of clan oriented felines disturbed the immense Warrior to his core. In his fiery hues, the newcomers were arrogant. The old ways he was used to were now essentially trash in the wind; respect, kindness, prowess in combat. All seemed to go out to the skies. Albeit this was more than likely the furthest possibilty from the truth. The newest Warriors were probably doing just fine, in fact, his most recent conversation with the fresh meat Marigolddust had nearly proven him wrong. He seemed just dandy, normal as could be. But with age, came discrimination against youth itself. Near jealousy came to the surface at the thought of it, thinking of his lavish life as a youngster. Whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted it...
He listened to her words, appreciative as ever. It was cathartic to speak to another, especially such a good, timely friend.
&quot;You&#39;re right. You arent one of them...&quot; The words held the ability to harness a certain sting, if taken the unintended way. However, this was soon redacted with his following speech.
&quot;... You&#39;re much, much better... you didnt leave me here with this fools. You didnt claw my ticker to tiny, insignificant pieces. And you didnt betray me at my strongest, leaving me to the side as a husk. Despite this... I still long for their company.&quot;
The tears had all but dried now, the only one to make it from its watery duct swiftly wiped away with a large scarred paw, as if it was never there. Once more, his purr rose to action, blending with her own to form a pleasant melody-esque audio. Her affection simply intensified this action. StitchFace loved Mothpelt, plain and simple. The love of two dear, long time comrades in arms. Not romantic, <em>albeit</em> the tom had considered making the proposal before. But that did not matter, at the moment.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Mothpelt herself had no mate. She had Aspenfall, but, where had the Tom gone..? She did not know. Honestly, she had also stepped away, just the same as him, but.. Mothpelt didn’t think herself attached to anyone. And to her, it was fine. While not completely in her prime, but not close to an elder, Mothpelt technically could have more kits, maybe not an entire 7 litter but still. But, would she ever find a companion worthy of such a place besides her? One she wished never left her side was Elmfire. The fiery Tom, who claimed her love in more than one litter, who blessed her with her most precious kittens, who held her love even when he wasn’t in the clan any longer. If he hadn’t been “on the run”, sheltering the family he had made in Thunderclan from his past.. He would’ve been endgame. But now...? The molly wanted a strong companion. Strong by her side, a charmer, definitely someone  who understood the Molly’s flirtatious fire... but a loyalist. The lioness needed a Lion of her own. And if she never found him... She would have to accept a life of solitude in her elder years. No kits to come by either to check on their mother.... 

She got sidetracked. At his words of the molly being better, the molly smiled softly to the Tom cat. “Believe me, I understand such a longing for those who have hurt us in more ways than before... But thank you. It means a lot for you to say I’m better than those who once had your heart. Alas, I would never break a dear friend’s heart. So don’t fret. And if anyone tries to, don’t worry. Send her my way. I’ll teach her to know better.” She teased, before letting out a soft sigh. <span class="mention" title="&#127479;&#127482; S T I T C H &#127479;&#127482;#7733">@&#127479;&#127482; S T I T C H &#127479;&#127482;</span></span>

Beanpaw chuckled, <strong>&quot;You can thank the hard rocks in SkyClan territory for that!&quot;</strong> He purred, following closely behind Fernpaw. As they stepped into the bramble entrance, Beanpaw couldn&#39;t keep his eyes in one place. It actually reminded him a bit of SkyClan&#39;s camp. He was surrounded by hard rock and cliff edges, however ThunderClan itself was settled in the bottom of the hollow, rather than all over it. Not to mention the greenery...everything was covered in brambles and undergrowth, as if the rocks had been made of healthy soil. Beanpaw almost felt crowded in here. <strong>&quot;It&#39;s beautiful!&quot;</strong> He mewed in awe. 

As they made their way across the camp towards the Fernpaw&#39;s den, he teased lightly,<strong>&quot;I guess we have some time to wait on my slow poke of a mentor,&quot;</strong> letting out a small giggle. <span class="mention" title="Spriteling#4439">@Spriteling</span> <span class="mention" title="Jay said &quot;MATERIAL GWORL&quot;#0677">@Jay said &quot;MATERIAL GWORL&quot;</span></span>

How had that squirrel gotten away? he wondered. And left the cut to prove it too... Niftyclaw imagined floating gallantly across the sandy clearing and laying the plump, furry body atop the fresh-kill for all his clanmates - especially the ladies - to admire. But now all he had was his damaged pride and a bloody nose, which he stood and licked at unattractively at best while his tail flicked irritably behind him in the greenleaf sun.</span>

<div class="pre pre--multiline language-diff">- ───────── CARDINALSPARK !! // WARRIOR OF THUNDERCLAN</div>

The russet tom awoke from slumber after one of his clanmates accidentally stumbled into him, quietly muttering an apology before being on their way. He rolled his eyes, before rising to his paws, a yawn escaping from his jaws. Things had slowly been returning back to normal as new-leaf was pushing away the last of the season of leaf-bare, which was pleasing to say the least. No longer would they have to deal with those harsh moons, at least for a while. His whiskers quivered slightly as he scanned the camp, before spotting the young tom Cobrapaw. Deciding to have a word with the apprentice, the tom strode over to him. <strong>“Hello, Cobrapaw. You don’t seem to be well, hm? Is there something bothering you? Someone perhaps?”</strong> He questioned, tilting his head slightly as he examined the tom. <strong>“If it helps, perhaps you wouldn’t mind getting out for a bit?”</strong> He offered, settling down a short distance away from the apprentice, amber eyes resting on the tom’s dark form.

Upon the approach of a warrior, the apprentice blinked out of his analytical concentration and focused his clear visionaries on the tom who spoke to him. With a mildly bored look, he sat up and said, <strong>&quot;The only thing that&#39;s bothering me is my unproductivity. If you can find a cure for that then I&#39;ll hop on your ride and do whatever you ask.&quot;</strong> 

Cobrapaw stood up at the offer and stretched his figure to relieve himself for a moment before finally seeming ready to move.</span>

<strong>&quot;This way,&quot;</strong> the sandalwood she-cat lead him through the tunnel, weaving past barriers like water in a stream. <strong>&quot;Don&#39;t snag yourself now.&quot;</strong> Pushing through the entrance, she landed in the clearing, broadening her shoulders as she soaked in the dappled sunlight, distorted through oak branches and the beginnings of leaves. Chuckling lightly, she bounced ahead of him with a grin plastered on her fluffy cheeks. Curiosities of Beanpaw&#39;s camp danced in her mind, but she dismissed them for now. They were at <em>her</em> home now, after all. And she could take all the time she could to bask in its presence. <strong>&quot;If you think it&#39;s pretty now you should see it in green-leaf. Little flowers grow all over the place, especially by my and Icestar&#39;s dens!&quot;</strong> With a skip Fernpaw made her way up the stone path that led to her den.

<strong>&quot;Sorry it&#39;s a bit dirty, I haven&#39;t really had the time to clean it out. Let me show you around!&quot;</strong> Without waiting for a response, she pulled him through, brushing against dead ivy leaves that have yet to fall off their vine, with little green nubs preparing to take their place. The light that filtered into the den displaced any dust that hung in the air. An assortment of mossy nests are tucked in the corner, adjacent to a slate shelving. Beside that, a small pool lay, occasionally disturbed by the dripping of water from above. Her pride, however, was the mural wall, the first stop on the tour. Red streaks formed swirls and discs, spiraling around each other in a constant waltz. Underneath them all sat a series of paw prints, all belonging to those who have left with the addition of herself. A lopsided fish and cartoon bear made their presence known with crooked smiles, looking out over the den&#39;s entrance. As Beanpaw took this all, Fernpaw was practically vibrating, waiting for some awh or questions or whatever so she could explain all about the paintings.

<em><strong><em>”Boulderstripe?&#160; I like that name,”</em></strong></em> he said with a small smile.&#160; He wished he could have said something more to compliment the name, but he couldn&#39;t come up with anything.&#160; Maybe he would have to find some way to compliment each name that he learned.&#160; <em>Boulderstripe… Boulderstripe…</em> how could he speak more fondly of the name?&#160; It sounded like it would belong to a strong cat, and very likely could have, yet he couldn&#39;t gather the confidence to assume such from a cat he didn’t know.&#160; Because of this, he decided that he wouldn&#39;t say anything else.&#160; Now was no time to ruin a possibly decent conversation, especially for a cat who didn’t want it to be ruined.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; Marigolddust’s light-tipped ears perked up as he mentioned hunting, both because he was nervous and because he was excited about the topic.&#160; If he was to go with Boulderstripe, he could actually feel like he was doing something good for the clan instead of just sitting around.&#160; Although, there was a reason why he never went out alone.&#160; He reminded himself of all of the dangers that the outside forest hid.&#160; There were foxes, falling branches, hawks, rouges, the risk of passing through a border unintentionally and getting cause, and there could be badgers running around anywhere in the territory.&#160; Although he wasn&#39;t too keen on keeping up with the news of the clan, he managed to be within earshot when two warriors passed by Fernpaw’s den while speaking of the badger that had attacked a patrol group.&#160; Laurelblaze had said that they scared it off, but most cats knew the chance of there still being some around.&#160; Even the other clans had been warned about it at the gathering.</span>

Cardinalspark strode out of the warriors den, tail waving high in a proud manner as he glanced about, in hopes of spotting something of interest today, but much to his disappointment, there was nothing out of the ordinary. A bored look flashed over his face for a moment, before he padded away from the den’s entrance, beginning to simply make his way around camp as he did so on many days. Amber eyes flickered about before landing on a nearby tom, a fellow warrior. Whiskers quivered slightly as he noticed the tom seemed to have been injured slightly, thus deciding to investigate on the manner. <strong>”I take it that hunting didn’t go as planned?”</strong> He asked, as he noticed the disappointment in the tom’s posture. <strong>”I hope you didn’t run into anything too bad, least you’d see the medicine cat if you truly need to.”</strong> He added, knowing that it wasn’t wise to leave injuries untreated - no matter how much one would like to, due to embarrassment.

The best word to describe him was probably disheveled. Parts of his fur were matted, like he had yet to groom himself after waking up. A little bit of dust stained his cheeks, where a milk dipped paw had rubbed a moment before. She could feel her throat tighten, the uneasiness between them nearly palpable. The second before he replied seemed to last an eternity, and in that moment Fernpaw thought of at least 17 reasons why he might say no.

Fortunately, with his brisk nod she released her breath. A tiny smile crept on her face as she tiptoed over to lay next to him. In one swift motion she plopped onto the ground, brushing her creamy pelt beside his own. She leaned into him - not too heavily, but enough for him to know she was there. Though the smile remained on her face, there was a clear sadness in her words. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m sorry for shouting earlier. You don&#39;t normally leave without saying anything I-&quot;</strong> Suddenly she began talking too quickly, her grin faltering as her heart began to beat faster. <strong>&quot;I was worried-&quot;</strong> She took the next moment to think, a hint of confusion lighting her gaze. Worried he left, that he wouldn&#39;t be coming back? Worried that they were no longer friends, that she pushed him away or perhaps he was taken against his will? All of the above and a dozen more fears, but all her concerns were too complex to voice for the moment. <em>Breathe,</em> she scolded herself softly. <strong>&quot;Worried that something happened,&quot;</strong> she concluded.

Even if he only left to say eat or stretch his legs, in this moment he was being far too quiet. He often would make a point to say something, even if it was muttered or with a stutter, but shutting down or away was not the Marigoldpaw that she knew. <strong>&quot;Hey,&quot;</strong> she mewed softly. <strong>&quot;We don&#39;t need to talk now.&quot;</strong> Well, it was out. She knew something was wrong and now her words hinted to the fact. With a deep breath, she forced herself to continue down this line of thinking. <strong>&quot;I know that.. words can be hard. Beetlestreak told me that talking with your friends can help with sad or confusing things, but you-&quot;</strong>

A sharp inhale cut off her words. <em>You what..?</em> As the words left her mouth she began to regret them. It sounded like she was instructing him, telling him that he <em>needed</em> to talk to her. Really, she needed his presence much more than the little tabby could realize, but that didn&#39;t mean the opposite was true. With a tinge of regret, she readjusted her posture, rightening herself a bit and drawing her tail closer.

<strong>&quot;N-nevertheless,&quot;</strong> she stammered quite obviously, like her tongue wouldn&#39;t move on it&#39;s own. <strong>&quot;I&#39;ll be here, if you want.&quot;</strong>

<em><strong><em>”I-I pick?”</em></strong></em> he repeated, suddenly more distressed than he had before.&#160; Even though he knew it was nothing big to stress over, it seemed like an important matter to choose where you hunt.&#160; What if he chose a place that didn’t have any prey around?&#160; What if he chose the place where the badger had attacked the patrol?&#160; What if he chose a place where some ad animal lived or a band of rogues claimed as their own territory?&#160; What if he chose somewhere close to the other borders of the clan, therefore risking what territory they were on?&#160; Well, the last possibility didn’t seem like it would be too much of a problem.&#160; He made sure to know the borders well, and Skyclan had done good at teaching him where the Thunderclan territory started and where it ended.&#160; He knew what it smelled like to be near a different border, and he knew what the territory looked like for the surrounding clans.&#160; If he smelt any striking scent of Riverclan, then he would avoid that area.&#160; If he saw too many dark pine trees then he would avoid that area.&#160; So, that wasn’t one of the biggest problems, although even with that one off the list there were many that he could worry about.</span>

<strong>” All cats who are old enough to catch their own prey, gather around for a Clan meeting!”</strong> Her call rang across the vacant quarry, awakening the last stragglers still burrowed in their comfortable dens. It was a beautiful morning out with clear, blue skies, the blazing sun shining radiantly and birds chirping to extravagant melodies. It was simply blissful and Icestar’s paws were already itching to sprint outside. 

Alas, she had responsibilities to settle first. The lynx-point focused upon her Clanmates who had begun to fill up the empty space. A mosaic of pelts of many colours and textures began to form, satisfying the ThunderClan leader. It had been a while since she had gathered the Clan in one spot. They had all been busy in this newleaf season but hopefully with greenleaf, everyone could rest and enjoy the few moons of tranquility - hopefully...

Sparrowpaw quivered in anticipation because -finally, she was going to be a warrior. She&#39;s watched as her friends went up above her and she never got to follow....but now. Now, she would finally be with them and have a whole different responsibility! 
Of course she was terrified. 
She had groomed her pelt until she couldn&#39;t seem to find any imperfections.. she had paced around the apprentices den until Icestar had called the clan. She practically jumped out in her nerves. Trying to spot a familiar face. But the only cat she could spot was her mentor, Keenstreak. And she was as sure as Starclan she didn&#39;t want to talk to that fox-heart. She scowled for a second before the light of the day sent her back to her worried thoughts. 

Despite her wishes her mentor came over. But he wasn&#39;t upset or scowling or disappointed. He was beaming? Beaming with pride that Sparrowpaw had rarely seen in her mentor. 
<strong>&quot;You did amazing, Sparrowpaw. I can&#39;t wait to meet you as a warrior.&quot;</strong>
She was surprised at that- she didn&#39;t know how to take in his gaze. It was more happy than usual. 
<strong>&quot;Thanks, Keenstreak.&quot;</strong> She couldn&#39;t help but tweak a smile at her mentors praise. Before sitting with everyone else. Looking up at Icestar expectantly. Her tail twitching.</span>

<strong>” There is no better way to start off this newleaf season than to celebrate the growth of a soon-to-be warrior. Having reached the dawn of the next stage in her life, we should honour her and the role she represents.”</strong> Fiery eyes settled upon the apprentice in subject.<strong>” Sparrowpaw, come,”</strong> she beckoned, a quick flick of her tail encouraging the young she-cat to join her up on the Highledge. 

She waited patiently - or that is what it appeared to be with a quick glance, as upon closer inspection once could notice the impatient twitching of an ear - as Sparrowpaw made her way up. Right to the spot which Icestar had pointed with the dark tip of her feathery banner. This location happened to be right next to her and the ThunderClan leader had to shift to the side in order to make enough room on the outcrop for the arriving apprentice.

The cream tabby stretched deeply, A large yawn escaping her maw as she adjusted to the sudden sounds of birdsong and commotion out her den. Gently, she nudged her friend awake. <strong>&quot;Good morning, Marigolddust,&quot;</strong> she whispered kindly. <strong>&quot;There&#39;s a meeting.&quot;</strong>

The sun decided to make its presence known, stray rays poking through the obstinate grey clouds to light the world below. It was almost as if the sky smiled upon the ceremony today. Skipping down the path from her den, The sandalwood fae made her way to where everyone was gathering, eager to see what news the day would hold.￼

<strong>&quot;Sparrowpaw,&quot;</strong> she repeated softly. <em>Oh, Sparrowpaw!</em> Recognition dawned on her features as little bits of excitement made her paws dance. Sparrowpaw will make a delightful warrior! She was bold, daring, and not afraid to speak her mind. Honestly not too different from the deputy, in that regard. Preemptively, Fernpaw cheered, thrilled for the clanmate she had only known through brief interaction. <strong>&quot;Yay Sparrowpaw!! Wooooo!&quot;</strong> Perhaps it was a little out of place, but what&#39;s the harm in a little extra joy?</span>

Icestars words seemed to echo in her head, her nerves were bouncing around in her stomach- she didn&#39;t even know if she could comprehend most of what Icestar said except for &quot;Come&quot; And the flick of the leaders tail. She was already fretting about the words her leader had said- and when her brain finally digested the words she felt even more nervous. But she was beaming at Icestar&#39;s words. It finally was her time- and she was more than grateful that Icestar was doing this correctly. 

She took the spot next to the leader. Her eyes widening slightly at the perspective... being on the highrock made her feel some strength of what was actually happening. <em>Im sitting right next to our leader...I&#39;m about to be a warrior....I can&#39;t believe it</em> 
And right when she she thought her heart would just burst from all her emotions- she spotted Fernpaw. The apprentice cheering her name in joy. Sparrowpaw perked up at the familiar sight of an apprentice. Fernpaw was the only cat who understood how Sparrowpaw would have felt to be left behind by her clanmates, and was the one who patched her up after her twisted paw and her other wounds from her spat with Keenstreak and Pinefoot... She gave a weak smile, her nerves weakened her grin but her happiness to see the apprentice made it seem sincere.</span>

The deputy had heard the call for the clan meeting coming from the lynx-point femora perched upon the Highledge. She took her place towards the center of the clearing, peering up towards the ledge to watch as the ceremony went underway. It was a warriors ceremony, one of the apprentices was being promoted— Sparrowpaw. Her eyes flickered towards the young molly who was about to be promoted, as well as to the figures in the crowd who were cheering her on, notably Fernpaw. The tortoiseshell couldn’t help but to chuckle lightly at the sight, before she returned her attention to the apprentice being promoted. She’d save her loud cheers for when her name was granted to her, that was when it was truly important.</span>

A few extra heartbeats were given to let the Clan take in Sparrowpaw upon the Highledge. When the noise settled, the ThunderClan leader decided to continue this sacred, once-in-a-lifetime ceremony: <strong>” I, Icestar of ThunderClan, call upon my warrior ancestors to look down on this apprentice. They have trained hard to understand the ways of your noble code, and I commend them to you as a warrior in turn.”</strong> 

Her lithe body shifted, focusing upon Sparrowpaw, whose excitement and nervousness bubbled quite vividly next to her. Ocean-coloured hues focused on the apprentice in shimmering flames. 

<strong>” Sparrowpaw, do you promise to uphold the warrior code and to protect and defend your Clan, even at the cost of your life?”</strong> It was a weighted decision to make. A rank in exchange for her devotion to the Clan.

The warrior grunted softly when he was awoken, but when Fernpaw mentioned a clan meeting he managed to wake himself up quick enough to stand and leave the den besides his friend.  Yawning, he looked around the camp and the cats who had gathered around it.  Who&#39;s ceremony was today?  Was it good news or bad news?  Looking around, he tried to guess what the meeting was for.  That was, until Icestar mentioned it.  <em>Sparrow paw?</em> He wondered.  He didn&#39;t recognize the name and had never actually met the apprentice, but the idea of a warrior ceremony got him excited for them.  Cats usually loved these ceremonies.  What would her name be?  He couldn&#39;t wait to find out.  Listening to icestar speak, he waited curiously to hear what name Sparrowpaw would earn.  Fernpaw seemed excited, which made him even more curious.  This soon-to-be-warrior must be a good cat and deserve the role of a warrior.</span>

{ -Sparrowpaw- // Ceremonies }

Seeing all the faces looking up at her... made her dizzy thoughts clear for a few seconds... but no time to think about that. Ice star had turned to her, their blue eyes gazing down at Sparrowpaw... their gaze strangely reminded her of the lake...

Before she even realized it, Icestar was giving her the request of the promise... the one she’s heard so many times before and now she finally got to answer. Her breath caught in her throat and she didn’t know if she could even breath- yet speak. She glanced at the crowd around her before looking up at Icestar again, straightening her posture. 

<strong>”I do.”</strong> 

Her promise held above her head quietly. If only for a second. Her own words ran back and forth in her own mind.</span>

With the traditional response having left Sparrowpaw’s lips, Icestar offered an encouraging smile. <strong>” Then by the powers of StarClan, I give you your warrior name,”</strong> she stated in a confident tone, chin set. <strong>” Sparrowpaw, from this moment on, you will be known as Sparrowfeather. StarClan honours your observant and diligent nature, and we welcome you as a full warrior of ThunderClan.”</strong>

Leaning forward, she rested her muzzle in between Sparrowfeather’s ears. Icestar’s tufted ears twitched as their Clanmates down below burst into joyous cheer. Rightly so. Like all newly made warriors, Sparrowfeather deserved this attention. The Clan also needed this boost of good morale. Icestar didn’t know how long this peace was going to last but she wished for her Clan to be as happy as they could be during it.

<em>I can’t breath- I can’t breath-</em>was all she could think as she held her breath. Icestar had her chin set as she was about to give her her warrior name... Sparrowpaw sucked in a much needed gasp of air as she received her name.... 

Sparrowfeather 

She beamed from Icestar’s praise- and expected Icestar to lean forward but was more than surprised when Icestar set her muzzle on her head as an act of acceptance into her new role- the brief contact made her nerves sky rocket as she internally struggled to get a hand on them. 

And then her clan started cheering.. for her! She closed her eyes briefly to savior the moment... she wanted to remember it forever.</span>

Though comfortable in her spot beside her grey friend, the small tabby could hardly keep herself still. She returns for a paws smile with and elated grin, cheers bubbling in her throat as she waited for the right moment to shout out her name this time.

And finally, it came. She glanced at Marigolddust for a moment￼, feeling a strange and overwhelming feeling of sadness. Another warrior made, and she was still just a &quot;paw.&quot; But, thunderclan&#39;s medicine cat couldn&#39;t let her frown show for long.￼ almost triumphantly, she shouted Sparrowfeathers name to the sky, one cheer in a chorus celebrating their clan mate&#39;s achievement.

<strong>&quot;Sparrowfeather! Sparrowfeather!&quot;</strong></span>

As the days seemed to be stretching into longer periods of daylight, the ThunderClan deputy couldn’t help but to feel pleased at the transition into new-leaf, and how smooth it seemed to be. No more surprise snowstorms, less frigid nights, even her clanmates seemed to be coming to life again. She even began to notice the shedding of some of her winter coat. Her loosened fur was starting to bunch up and fly off her frame when quick gusts of wind rolled by. Her “lion’s mane” as she liked to call the thick ring of fur surrounding her chest and the nape of her neck was going to be a bit more tame for the warmer seasons, less prominent than usual.

One thing had been troubling her, she was made aware that one of the kits she and Hollyfrost had taken in went to go see Fernpaw about an issue regarding his ear. To say she didn’t notice a problem before would have been neglectful on her part as a parent, so she was glad the kit had gotten assistance from the medicine cat. The litter still didn’t fully trust her or her mate just yet, they weren’t very cooperative nor did they confide much in them. Some more than others. The deputy wanted to check in with the medicine cat to see what was going on with Foxkit, so she wasn’t entirely in the dark. Who better to tell her than the medicine cat herself? She padded up towards the entrance of the medicine cat den, peering inside to see if she could spot the young sandalwood molly. <strong>”Fernpaw? It’s me, Laurelblaze, could we talk real quick?”</strong>

Fernpaw really wasn&#39;t doing much of anything at the moment. It was quite odd actually, a contrast to her rather busy self. In this moment, her eyes almost seemed glazed over as she stared at a patch of sunlight creep its way into her den. If asked what was on her mind, it would be difficult to voice. Rather, it felt like a bunch of disconnected thoughts bouncing around as she tried to grab one to follow rather than sit by as it dissipated. The little bits she managed to snag this time were about the warmer weather. It reminded her of last leaf-fall, where her and Marigolddust -- still and apprentice at the time -- rolled down into the hidden meadow. A lopsided smile crept up her maw.

But sadly, another thought interrupted her daydream. There was a shadow that blocked the golden ray that she seemed enamored by. Blinking, she turned to face the visitor, fixing her expression to wear a more comfortable smile. Anyone who was been around the quarry would instantly recognize the dappled she-cat. It took a moment more of thinking before she perked up. <strong>&quot;Oh, sure thing!&quot;</strong>

The tan medic hopped to the den entrance, lightly placing a paw beside the deputy&#39;s own and tapping it lightly. <strong>&quot;You&#39;re blocking my sunlight though.&quot;</strong> Impish grin aside, she could benefit from getting out of her den. Even after cleaning it, the scent of stale herbs was as omnipresent as Starclan. And since Laurelblaze wasnt in a panic or anything, it would probably be safe to bask while they talked. She hoped, at least.

She had interrupted a rare moment of repose for the ever-busy medicine cat of ThunderClan, her large frame taking up the majority of the entrance into the cave that the den was situated inside. When the younger molly had pointed out this fact, the deputy couldn’t help but to blink a bit out of shock. Normally whenever she spoke with Fernpaw, she didn’t sound nearly as bold as she was...

<em>I must be being a bad influence on these kits, they’re learning too much about my ways. They’re too smart.</em>

All jokes aside, she stepped aside to let the medic exit her den with relative ease, before stepping out herself. She was willing to hear her out, that was good, she’d been wondering about poor Foxkit’s ears ever since she heard about his trip to this den. She would have escorted him to it and sat through it, but she was out for that day while he was getting it looked at. <strong>”I wanted to ask you about Foxkit, he came to you about his ears, right? I don’t know if you’re aware of the situation but they’re not really updating me about what’s going on. Awfully shy little things, well... Some are more prone to snapping at me or Hollyfrost if we try to get them to open up.”</strong> she wasn’t going to name-drop anyone, but there was a bit of a problem child in that litter, and she was prone to... biting or clawing anyone if they tried to get anywhere near her or her siblings if she was around. Needless to say, they weren’t really going to talk to them for now, but maybe they’d ease up and trust them in due time. They were going to be permanent additions to the clan after all, and she wanted the best for all her beloved children.</span>

Laurelblaze was just trying to find any way they could get a foothold in the clan and actually get used to it. Maybe then she’d have better luck getting them to trust her... She was a rather scary-looking cat, especially as a stranger to these kits she’d adopted. Laurelblaze needed to gain their trust.

Similarly to Fernpaw, Marigoldpaw felt like the few moments of him hiding under his paws, waiting for the sandalwood to settle down beside him was an eternity.&#160; Had she left?&#160; Was she coming?&#160; DId this make her feel awkward?&#160; What if she didn’t want to come over by him and just offered to be polite?&#160; Was he bothering her through saying yes?&#160; Many different thoughts and questions ran through his head at a much higher speed than he was used to.&#160; He could barely think much of any of them; all he could do was worry over them.&#160; But, these thoughts were slowed significantly when he felt the warm flank of his friend’s against his own side.&#160; He paused, growing more quiet than before.&#160; He started to breathe a bit more steadily, but the sudden growth of relaxation also led his tears to fall more freely.&#160; Still he was too scared to speak, and still he didn’t say a word.&#160; Although, now his doubts didn’t only slow down, but so did the thoughts that caused the breakdown in the first place, even if they were slowed only a small bit.&#160; He felt more free with accepting comfort, and he felt eager to snatch any opportunity that offered him reassurance.&#160; He himself leaned slightly on Fernpaw, although he still kept his face hidden.</span>

&#160;&#160;&#160; Fernpaw’s words echoed in his head.&#160; Perhaps that was a good thing, as it would make sure he understood them, although at the same time he felt that mentally repeating every word was beginning to overwhelm himself even more.&#160; He was unable to reply to the words with the goal of seeming okay resting on his shoulders.&#160; If he said anything, his voice would surely reveal the fact that what he was experiencing wasn&#39;t normal.&#160; Maybe if he kept quiet she wouldn’t figure it out?&#160; Silent cries never told anybody who couldn’t hear them anything, anyways.&#160; Even so, he still listened to what Fernpaw was saying.&#160; <em>Worried?</em>&#160; He thought over the words quietly.&#160; Why would Fernpaw be worried?&#160; Did he really need to make her become worried?&#160; Maybe he should just give in and reveal how he was feeling.&#160; Would that make her feel better?&#160; No, she knew that he was okay now, physically at least.&#160; So what should he do?&#160; What was the best decision?&#160; Which choice wouldn’t end up resulting with a bad consequence?&#160; What if he chose the wrong path in this whole situation and just messed everything up?&#160; He had made the poor decision of holding everything against his mother, and now look at where it brought them.&#160; He didn’t want to mess this up to.&#160; Clenching his teeth, he tucked in his head even more aggressively, trying to hold back another cry.&#160; His muzzle hurt from it being so scrunched up in the effort, but he couldn’t stop it.&#160; His eyes felt sore with the multiple attempts of trying to keep them open to avoid more tears or any other mess ups, and eventually he gave in and closed his eyes, releasing more tears than he had expected he’d collected.</span>

&#160;&#160;&#160; Everything seemed to freeze at the realization that Fernpaw already knew that something was wrong.&#160; What was he feeling?&#160; Was he happy, upset, angry that she had figured it out?&#160; At himself for letting her figure it out?&#160; Was he relieved?&#160; He didn’t have to hide it anymore, yet he felt that if he showed himself something bad would happen.&#160; What that something was, he wasn’t sure.&#160; Marigoldpaw quietly listened to what Fernpaw was saying, and became confused when she cut off.&#160; He wouldn’t have minded being instructed; he felt that he needed directions.&#160; He wasn’t used to this, not even when his sister passed.&#160; What should he do?&#160; Realizing that Fernpaw had stopped with the instructions, Marigoldpaw’s thoughts and cries went silent.&#160; He could only feel in that moment, and his feeling of longing to take the advice overpowered his fear and sadness.&#160; Fernpaw was his best friend, and he really did need to talk.</span>

&#160;&#160;&#160; Reluctantly raising his head, he began to once again wipe new tears away and gulped.&#160; He was afraid to look at Fernpaw and see an undesirable expression, so he looked down at the ground instead.&#160; Inhaling and exhaling deeply, he coughed to clear his throat so he could attempt to speak.&#160; <em><strong><em>”T-thank you…”</em></strong></em> he said softly, his voice hoarse.&#160; <em>Alright, you got that out.&#160; Now you have to share what’s wrong.</em>&#160; He thought to himself.&#160; Did he want to, though?&#160; Yes, he did.&#160; He had to if he wanted to feel better.&#160; So what was wrong?&#160; Oh, there was so much wrong.&#160; Everything dealing with his mother triggered unwanted emotions, and thinking about it caused his face to begin to grow hot again as tears fell once more.&#160; He felt exposed in that moment.&#160; He felt exposed to the whole clan, to Starclan, <em>to his mother.</em>&#160; Suddenly feeling the want for a barrier between him and everything else, he sought for comfort and found himself putting his face against his friend’s sandalwood fur.&#160; Finally, he voiced the conflict that raged in his head.&#160; <em><strong><em>”I-I m-miss Bluebellmist…”</em></strong></em> he croaked, letting tears stream down his fur.</span>

The camp was actually quiet for once today, hardly anyone was around to disturb the young tabby warrior as she sat in the clearing. She was letting her pale tan fur soak up the sun’s rays as she could finally indulge herself in the warm weather at last. She was born around this time of year, and she actually liked this weather— but it didn’t help with the young she-cat’s temper or attitude towards others. She was still cold and critical, and was not going to tolerate anyone intruding on her personal space. 

Unfortunately for poor Marbledpaw, the cat she had spotted was one she wouldn’t have wanted to disturb on this day. As soon as Finchbriar heard the insufferable “mewls” of an apprentice she saw as nothing more than a weak infant, she shot her a vicious glare that rivaled even the sun in its intensity. <strong>”What do you want?”</strong> she growled lightly, her ears flattening against her skull as she addressed the apprentice with hostility. The she-cat was rather irritable, and had a <em>very</em> short fuse, especially when it came to kits and apprentices. How dare this lowly creature approach <em>her!</em>

<strong>”If you’re blind, I’m sitting out here by myself for a reason. This better be important.”</strong> she let out a small huff as she looked up at the sky for a moment, her leaf-green gaze burning with annoyance already. Just great, the one day this camp isn’t filled with idiots running their mouths all day and she’s interrupted. How rude of them! She’d have to give this apprentice a piece of her mind for even deigning to intrude upon her time of relaxation, too bad she couldn’t give her a good cuff on the ear for it. Otherwise <em>she’d</em> get in trouble for it, even if the little brat deserved it.

Oh, it appeared she hurt the little creature’s feelings. She scoffed at the apprentice’s reasons for even approaching her in the first place. Don’t they ever realize that warriors aren’t there to entertain them or to serve as their guides unless they were their mentors? She shook her head as she took a deep breath, composing herself a bit as she stared down at the younger she-cat. Her emotions were still present in her gaze and her mannerisms, but she was not sounding nearly as vicious as before. She just sounded cold and domineering rather than outright hostile. <strong>”Really, out of anyone else you could have picked, you thought I would serve as your optimal choice in company?”</strong> she was still going to regard this apprentice as lesser than her. Who did she even think she was talking to in that sarcastic tone of hers?

<strong>”Hey, runt, I’m hardly lonely. When I want to talk to someone, I will. You’re the one who got in my space.”</strong> she rolled her eyes at her implication, Finchbriar was perfectly fine with her current situation in her social life. If she deemed someone worthy of her attention, she would willingly grant it to them. This apprentice just barged in and thought she could just immediately be all cute and friendly, that wasn’t going to work for her— though the warrior admired the moxie, not many cats tended to approach her due to her thorny exterior. Maybe she could give her a few minutes, just a few.</span>

I used to go out with my friends when I was younger than you were!”</strong> albeit, even she knew that was against the rules at the time, she wasn’t really one to care that much. Finchbriar thought she could go above the rules, especially considering her bloodline tied back to a former leader of their esteemed clan. She saw herself as superior to many of the cats of her clan, so it was rare she ever did converse with anyone, let alone an apprentice. <strong>”I won’t tell, I don’t snitch!”</strong> that was true, she hardly cared if someone got in trouble for their own actions.

The marbled femme spent most of her time by herself or with one or two cats, barely bothering to socialize most of the time unless she wanted to. Maybe that was why she approached the warrior in the first place unknowingly. Being tempted to talk <em>back</em> to the warrior, though, was just her temper and pride. Nothing else.

These apprentices didn’t even know what life was about, getting to sneak out on their own without even getting caught. <em>Lame, they’re so concerned about not getting in trouble and afraid nobody will believe them. Don’t they realize how gullible the lot of them are?</em> she could play them for the fools they were, and she had in the past— even at their own age. She liked to captivate the ones she deigned as worthy of her attention, appealing to them, while still remaining in control of the conversation. She was quite manipulative, though in the past she’d let others get a little <em>too</em> close to her, and she had to cut them off. They’d only get in her way in the long run, and some of them no longer remained in the clan. <em>Good riddance, I say.</em>

A devilish smirk crept upon her sharp features, her eyes glinting with mischief as she stared down at the apprentice. <strong>”Well, why don’t you take someone your age along? Impress them a little and get them to talk about your exploits? Pull out the charm.”</strong> she chuckled quietly, her own formula when it came to impressing the ones she wanted to hang out with. Eloquent speech, showing off her various talents in the field of warriorhood. Finchbriar wanted to appear elegant and poised to the cats she did “like”, while being untouchable yet dangerous to those she didn’t. The tabby certainly had an inflated ego to say the least, though it wasn’t helped by her status within the clan and her supposed “superiority” over the others because of it. 

She flicked her tail tip a bit as she glanced back down to the apprentice, shaking her head a bit. <strong>”But I’m assuming you don’t know about that, you apprentices don’t realize how much you have available to you.”</strong> now she was just sounding pretentious, but she didn’t care, she assumed all apprentices really cared about was training and looking good to their peers— but not know how to properly go about it.

Despite how he tried to hide it, it was obvious that he was crying. Stifled gasps for air between sniffles was all too familiar a sound to the tan tabby. It caused her chest to tighten and a rush of emotion to come over her, as if it were herself she heard crying. In an instant, she became defensive, her pelt bristling slightly. Whatever, <em>whoever</em> made Marigoldpaw feel this way, she&#39;d chase them off, biting at their heels all the way to the edge of the territory, and beyond even.

As he rest his head against her flank, all of that dissolved. Emerald gaze settled on him gently, and what was going to be a low growl, a bubbly purr began to form in its stead. She rest her head on top of his in return before closing her eyes, taking just a moment to be comfortable with the space she was in, her scent mingling with her friend&#39;s, her heart thumping in her ears..

But that was selfish, no? He needed more than her presence, he needed to talk, right? Then again, who was she to know what he needed? In a quite similar fashion to her old mentor, a list of herbs ran through her head to reduce anxiety. Juniper berries, also good for bellyaches, especially after crying too hard. Chamomile, for general strength of appetite. Poppy seed, to sleep off pain. And all of these solutions, of course, were temporary. They could all make you forget for the moment, but once they wore off the pain would come rushing back.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Did he know what he needed though? Fernpaw rubbed her cheek against his forehead, as if to remind herself that he was still there, or maybe to remind him. It was so easy to do things when you&#39;re told what to do, be it by mentors or medicine cats or even mothers. But neither of them had such a luxury, and so they had nothing but themselves, or in this moment each other. She didn&#39;t know what he needed, and he probably didn&#39;t either, but that wouldn&#39;t stop them from finding it.

A series of phrases flashed in her head as she tried to comfort the grey tom. She opened her mouth but quickly shut it. It was almost reflexive, to say that Bluebellmist would be with Starclan. But what would that matter? Beetlestreak was there, but that didn&#39;t mean she got to see him. She couldn&#39;t hug him or tell him about her day or ask him where to find more catmint. 

What should she say then? <em>&#39;I&#39;m sure she misses you too?&#39;</em> Fernpaw didn&#39;t know Bluebellmist, and it would be a lie to pretend she did. It&#39;s not fair that she wasn&#39;t here right now, it&#39;s not fair that she wasn&#39;t with Marigoldpaw, so unceremoniously leaving his life. Bringing attention to this, it didn&#39;t feel like the right thing to do. He knew it was unfair, and it hurt. It hurt so much.

The sand furred she-cat blinked. Hard. Little dewdrops began to form in her own eyes. Smiling, she turned to face the ash touched tom, lifting a milky paw to wipe at his own tears, a stream which quickly began to wet her own pelt. With a sad smile, she mewed softly. <strong>&quot;I know.&quot;</strong>

Biting his lip, he suddenly felt a rush of regret.&#160; Doubts ran through his head just as a fish swam in a river; coming quickly and leaving quickly, darting swiftly through a stream as they headed for their destination.&#160; There was no clear destination, though.&#160; The thoughts continued to go around and around in circles, disappearing and reappearing into his head one after another, showing themselves for just a moment before leaving again.&#160; They changed subjects and moods that seemed as unique as the seasons, and right now the season his mind was set on seemed awfully brown.&#160; Not exactly for any reason in particular, although the color seemed to fit the feeling of wanting to go back in time.&#160; Murky and unchangeable, even if you did add any other hue or color to the mix.&#160; Why was he doing this?&#160; Why was he taking up Fernpaw’s time over something that would forever remain a reality?</span>

For once, just as he had wished for for a long time, something wasn’t going to change.&#160; Unfortunately, he wished it could.&#160; He shouldn&#39;t be getting so much attention, not when anybody else might need it for a better reason.&#160; Yet, he needed someone to lean on.&#160; This was all so overwhelming!&#160; He couldn’t seek asylum with his mother, as she was no longer in the world that he called home.&#160; He was too nervous to ask Rooksnap, as he wasn’t sure if she would react like she did when they had a conversation about Beetlestreak.&#160; Fernpaw was his closest friend, and the only cat that he could seek some reassurance from.&#160; Why did thoughts have to be so complicated?&#160; And emotions?&#160; Feelings?&#160; None were making sense right now, and he felt so <em>overwhelmed</em> because of it.&#160; If anything, it made the situation even worse.&#160; He had to choose something, make a decision on what was a better way to think.&#160; Try and hide how he felt until Fernpaw left, or accept his friend’s presence?</span>

The decision was made as soon as he felt her head rest on top of his own.&#160; Suddenly feeling much more calm and relaxed, he took in a&#160; deep breath and released a slow, raspy exhale.&#160; He felt warmer, even if the weather was a little cool for him.&#160; Curling his tail close to himself and hiding his limbs underneath himself, tears streamed down his cheeks smoothly and evenly, causing creases of sorts to form in his fur, catching any stray dust that had been swept past him.&#160; Automatically, another wave came to him.&#160; He clenched his teeth again, curling his muzzle and letting loose yet another small wine. Although his emotions had gotten better than they were before, it seemed like his body had a different system that it had memorized.&#160; Although he felt more comforted, tears seemed to come to him just as easily as they had before.&#160; Even so, he didn’t let it bother him all too much.&#160; He felt like it was going to be alright, even if this pain and sorrow felt so uncomfortable.&#160; It was all going to be alright… a least, that’s what he hoped.</span>

As a pearly paw brushed away some of the tears that had been streaming down from lemony hues, Marigoldpaw was finally able to make himself open his eyes a little bit more, no longer as afraid of humiliation, although it lay barely dormant inside of him.&#160; <em>I know.</em>&#160; The tw words brought a twisted knot of feelings to his chest.&#160; A new dark hue of blue seemed to settle on everything around him, swallowing up all of the warm colors that had been apparent just moments before.&#160; She knew, of course she knew.&#160; She had lost Beetlestreak, who was her mentor who left too soon.&#160; A mentor was more similar to a parent than he could imagine anything else to be, and he had never seen the small sandalwood besides him breaking down like this.&#160; So why was he?&#160; He was overreacting, taking the stage and the attention when he didn’t need it.&#160; <em><strong><em>”I- I’m sorry, I shouldn’t-</em></strong></em> he began, before a new sob interrupted him.&#160; He couldn’t finish the sentence, but he felt that it might send the message that he knew what she must be thinking.&#160; He shouldn&#39;t be acting like this.&#160; There were so many other cats who had experienced losses, losses likely more harmful than he had ever known.&#160; All he could think was the same thing that he had said; <em>i’m sorry.</em></span>

Ah, it appeared the young apprentice was finally enlightened to what she had at her disposal in the art of captivation. Apprentices were easy to please, you could fake it until you make it around them and they wouldn’t notice the difference. They tended to believe whatever someone had to say pretty easily, especially if they perceived them as more experienced in a certain field than them. Finchbriar had been able to gain the attention of others easily, even at Marbledpaw’s age. <strong>”But of course!”</strong> she smirked lightly, her eyes glinting as the apprentice already seemed to be falling into her snares. She could explain her methodology to someone while employing it in their interaction.

<em>Ah, so easy to fool. It’s almost boring.</em>

She straightened her posture, her position regal and elegant. A faux smile adorned her features, and she chuckled quietly. Not only amused at the fact she seemed to get some gullible apprentice to pay attention even after she accosted her— but at the fact she was interested in her skillset. How amusing, perhaps she could share a few secrets here and there. Maybe she could end up being less irritating if she kept her quiet and forced her to listen closely. <strong>”I’m sure you’re aware some apprentices are quick to believe others, even if they’re not entirely true.”</strong> it was true, some of them could be total <em>mousebrains</em> with the things they believed as soon as they heard it for the first time. Always so susceptible to believing in absolute foxdung.</span>

There was a fine line to tread, and she’d gotten good at making others believe she was actually good at some skills she could actually be lacking in. Deception was a crucial step in getting others to actually like you. It wasn’t like nobody ever lied before. She’d just gotten good at it.

he russet tom snickered a bit at Niftyclaw’s words, a soft sigh escaping from him. <strong>”Allergies? Why that’s strange, I assume you must know how to handle such then.”</strong> He replied with a shake of his head. He wasn’t sure <em>what</em> had exactly happened to the tom earlier that morning, but perhaps allergies really had caused it. <em>That’s a bit of a stretch though.</em> He thought to himself, flicking his tail. <strong>”Ah well, these things happen as new-leaf approaches, apparently.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Blurryowl didn’t really mind storms; yes, there were some more severe than others, but most times they were manageable. There were some, though, that would require cats to take shelter, and that was not a fun time at all. Luckily, though, this didn’t seem like one of those. As Laurelblaze mused her findings out loud, the she cat found herself looking at the sky, head tilting as she felt a raindrop land on her head. Drat. It really was raining.  Thank StarClan she had come back when she did because that wouldn’t have been a fun time for anyone. Red-and-blue eyes turned as she regarded the state of the camp before turning up to the sky once more. <strong>^”Of course it is. Good thing I came back from the territory when I did, then. Walking back to camp through rain doesn’t sound like a fun time for anyone, does it now?”*</strong> she joked slightly, turning to face Laurelblaze. 

At the deputy’s question, her odd eyes narrowed a bit as she thought up what to answer. What did bring her here? A longing for conversation? Well, yes, but was there anything else? She didn’t really know. And so she waited a moment, her tufted ears flicking. Her speech was brisk; short and simple, yet elusive in the same sense. <em><strong>”What brings anyone anywhere?”</strong></em> the question was more so meant to be metaphorical, but it was a good one nonetheless. <em><strong>”To answer your question, though, I’m not exactly sure myself. Conversation, perhaps? But isn’t that what everyone is after? Whatever the case may be, how are you faring? Honestly.”</strong></em>

She wasn’t going to be heading out into the territory in this mess. Laurelblaze didn’t like cold showers, and the mud that clung to her paws like stubborn, spiky burrs caught in her fur if she passed by a bramble bush. Except it was caked on earth and it was gross and uncomfortable to pick out of her fur or to wash it off. Especially on her large paws, they were magnets for the substance. Luckily she was staying in camp for the day, it was the patrols’ problem now. <em>They’ll probably come back soon anyways, it’ll be a washout anyways. We’ll have to remark the border later on. What a hassle.</em> she let out a small sigh at the thought, more work to handle later, at least until the rainstorm passed. The deputy would have to worry about that later, no use whining about it, it wasn’t like marking a border took too much effort. <strong>”Yeah, wouldn’t want to get caught in a downpour,”</strong> she mused aloud, staring up at the gray skies. More raindrops fell nearby, staining the sand-colored soil nearby with dark beige impact circles. It wasn’t too intense yet, but she still was paying careful attention to it. <strong>”I’m doing well, the kits I adopted with Hollyfrost seem to be settling in a bit... I think. Some of them can be a bit of a pawful.”</strong> she grinned awkwardly at the thought, they were a stubborn bunch, reminded her of herself when she was at their age. As she spoke, the rain seemed to increase in intensity, more and more droplets falling from the sky and hitting the ground in rapid succession.</span>

She shook her head quickly, letting out a small huff before she began to make her way towards one of the more sheltered areas of the camp. Laurelblaze wasn’t going to hide in the warriors den, she wanted to stay outside in camp, get some fresh air at least. The large tortoiseshell glanced up to see one of the outcroppings of stone jutting out from the side of the camp’s walls. It would provide an ample shelter from the rain for the two of them. Taking note of this, the deputy sat down and began to relax as she waited for Blurryowl to join her. This beat standing out there waiting for the rain to soak her fur.

She agreed. Flowery mannerisms had never been her strong suit. 

A nonexistent brow rose questioningly as the tom’s head tilted up toward the sky, as if contemplating his boredom. <em>Great. A second Nightpanther…</em> Icestar thought while he spoke. The tip of her tail giving an erratic twitch. <em>No wonder he glanced up. His ego&#39;s in the clouds!</em> Despite these inner thoughts, there was no irritation. Instead, nostalgia overwhelmed her senses. 

Her sea-green eyes narrowed slightly as Cobrapaw introduced himself, whilst prowling around her like a predator. A paw was already poised, tempted to smack his tail down and pin him in place. She wasn’t going to let anyone treat her like prey. Not even her own Clanmates. 

<strong>” Amusement?”</strong> She echoed, setting her chin confidently. Was he toying around with her? If so, two can play that game. 

 A cool smirk twisted across her masked face. <strong>” Depends on the type you’re looking for.”</strong>

Tigerpaw had waited ever so patiently for the time of day when most of her clanmates - the strict warriors, especially - were out of camp. This way she could get a peek at the leader&#39;s den without getting her ears yowled off. Her ringed tail coiled in rhythmic curiosity as she inched suspiciously close to the mouth of the cave, too fascinated not to have her back turned on anyone who might be witnessing her. <span class="mention" title="cake#9694">@cake</span></span>

<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content"><strong>&quot;That sounds like a lot,&quot;</strong> she mewed with a faint twitch of her whiskers, a gentle melancholy settling on her features- the pessimism had caught up to her over time, and she didn&#39;t have much time to think about.. friends, and social standing, or even showing off when she was too cooped up in feeling sorry for herself and bitter at everyone else in the world.

<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">Treating this like any apprentice would with a hunting session, she was thinking everything over, repeating all the steps in her head without knowing how easily Finchbriar was bending her to her wishes - the exact opposite of what she hoped this conversation would turn out. And Marbledpaw didn&#39;t even <em>think</em> of how this advice could spiral out the wrong way. If she failed, there could be some consequences.
</div></div>
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">The calico flicked her ears, glancing back up with a little glitter of adoration in her gaze - she fell in a rabbit hole, this time - and nodded faintly again; several times, actually. <em>Quick to believe others.</em> Did she mean her? The apprentice frowned. She was a little trusting of the <em>warrior&#39;s</em> advice, but if she managed to survive as a ThunderClan warrior, her words must be worth listening to, shouldn&#39;t it?

Finchbriar practically had this method down to a science at this rate. She’d made friends that way for moons, getting them to believe in her and to be enamored with her charm and skills. She’d been focused on keeping her status within the clan even with the fall of her family lineage, she was the daughter of Hawkstar, and she was focused on returning them to their former glory. While she didn’t strive to become a leader like her mother had, she wanted her family to become prominent and apparent in the history of ThunderClan. Not being seen as a footnote in their history, many of these cats didn’t even think about her mother’s work as a leader. They were ignorant, and that was her greatest gripe with the state of ThunderClan. Her mother deserved better than that, her legacy shouldn’t be lost to time.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Her dreary thoughts were disregarded as the apprentice spoke up once again, asking her about her advice. A sly grin adorned her features, and a confident tone laced her words: <strong>”Why, if I hadn’t tried it, then why would I be telling you to try it?”</strong> she wasn’t lying here, but she was much more experienced in putting up fa&#231;ades, if this apprentice attempted it, she might not get it right away. Unless she was a really good liar, that also tended to help her in her endeavors. Being able to lie and make it sound convincing was important in ensuring it’s success when employed in a real setting. To think this apprentice was actually looking to her for advice... Maybe she could help shape her into something less annoying. <strong>”As in advice? Well, if you’re successful, then you might not need my help. However, if you end up crashing and burning or noticing slight mistakes then... Well you could come to me for critique.”</strong> her grin had fallen to a stern, cold expression. She wasn’t going to be kind or gentle with her words, she’d turn this kit’s self-esteem into mince meat. It was better that she be harsh and critical than coddle this kit. How else would she actually learn?

Lavendercloud purred contently as she watched her kits sleep, her paws tucked under her still form. Her heart swelled with pride and love for the slumbering little ones. She could hardly wait until they could patrol and hunt for the clan with her. After more than a few moments of envisioning her kits growing to be strong warriors, the she-cat rose to her paws carefully, as to not awaken them. The fluffy queen&#39;s tail hovered over the ground as she picked her way through the warm bodies occupying the space and finally emerged from the den. 

The thick, pearl-grey fur of the she-cat was illuminated by beams of sunlight that streamed over her form as she stepped out. Lavendercloud yawned and let a low groan escape her as she stretched the stiffness from her joints and limbs. The cool air felt refreshing, as it was always warm in the nursery. As she shook her downy pelt, her tail plumed behind her and gently swayed every so often. The she-cat&#39;s byzantine gaze wandered around the camp for several moments before she padded towards the fresh kill pile. It wasn&#39;t very full, she noted with a flick of her ear. Suddenly, her lips were tugged into a smile. This was the perfect opportunity to hunt, for the first time in what felt like forever. The queen loved her kits dearly, but every day she was cooped up inside the nursery an itch to stretch her limbs and get her blood pumping grew stronger. The she-cat&#39;s pupils rounded at the thought of leaving camp, and it was decided as she lifted her head and scanned the faces of her clanmates for a worthy hunting partner.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Morning had come too fast. The white she cat had not gotten any sleep, as had been the norm, it seemed. Those dreams had haunted her for as long as she could remember, and yet, when she woke up, it seems that they were gone in the blink of an eye. She didn’t remember them after she woke up and she thought that it might be better that way - remembering was always the worst part of it all, to her. The white molly opened her eyes - she didn’t know why they were closed in the first place, it wasn’t like she was sleeping (although maybe she did it to make it seem like that was the case) and she pattered out of the warrior’s den, her plume-like tail flicking behind her. Furrowing her brows as she left the den, she shot a quick glance to the sky. Dawn. A lovely time of day, yet the camp was not alive just yet. A sigh. At least <em>they</em> got a good night’s sleep, though. 

Her odd gaze moved throughout the faces of her awake Clanmates as she searched for someone to talk to, willing to make the best of this no-sleep opportunity and at least try to make a couple of friends, right? Her ocean-and-ichor gaze moved in and out of the faces of her Clanmates and a black tipped ear flicked. Sucking in a breath as she noticed Lavendercloud, the odd molly padded over, offering a smile that she hoped would come off as friendly. <em><strong>”Good morning, stranger. Awfully early for either of us to be awake, no?”</strong></em>

As a sudden voice filled her ears, Lavendercloud grinned. The she-cat&#39;s tail raised in greeting as she took in the sight of her white-furred clanmate. The other cat&#39;s lids drooped and her tail seemed to drag behind her. It was safe to say Blurryowl looked more than a little tired. Lavendercloud&#39;s violet eyes met cerulean and crimson ones. <strong>&quot;You&#39;re right. Just had to stretch these legs before the kits awoke.&quot;</strong> The molly spoke lightheartedly. <strong>&quot;Say, wouldn&#39;t a morning hunt do us some good, hm? It&#39;ll surely shake the drowsiness from our bones. What do you say?&quot;</strong> As the feline arrived to her point, her eyes flashed with excitement that she tried to conceal. The queen knew she was perfectly capable of starting a hunt on her own, but it had indeed been a while since she had done so. Couldn&#39;t hurt to have some company. And surely Blurryowl needed some way to stay awake. The idea was mutually beneficial. Satisfied with her reasoning, Lavendercloud gazed expectantly at the other.</span>

She hadn’t been able to sleep well at all these past few days and she was all but sure of the culprit. Her nightmares were, at their core, seemingly harmless and innocuous, however, to people like us, people like her, they were more than that; taunting, daunting, and effortlessly horrifying. Was it, then, a prelude to the end of her story? She hadn’t a clue. Blinking away her reverie, she offered a smile to the other. 

<em><strong>”A hunt could do no harm, certainly. You never know if you don’t try, right?”</strong></em> a bright and all-knowing smile, her mismatched hues bright at the suggestion. She was right, a hunt could help get her mind off of the bigger things at paw (namely, the nightmares that had been haunting her her entire life), and what better time to do it than at dawn? <em><strong>”My name is Blurryowl, by the way. What about you?”</strong></em>

Dark and light grey fur adjusted under the beaming sunlight of the early morning as the young warrior gently flopped down onto his side.&#160; He kept himself farther from the more society-populated areas of the camp, and instead went to where a cat could almost always find him; right next to the walls of the camp.&#160; Where he was laying was a bit dusty and dirty, but he didn’t want to lose the opportunity to have a sunbath.&#160; It wasn&#39;t exactly Green-Leaf weather, but the new warmth after the chilly moons of Leaf-Bare seemed just as able to satisfy him.&#160; Oh, how he had missed New-Leaf!&#160; The constant fear of getting sick while he was resting was no longer a necessary worry, although there were still some days where it wasn&#39;t the warmest or where snow stil fell.&#160;&#160;

Marigolddust wasn’t exactly sure if the whole clan considered the season to still be Leaf-Bare or New-Leaf, but he himself chose to believe in the more cheerful view.&#160; Before the weather changed into that of a more warm one, he remembered occasionally wondering if New Leaf would really return.&#160; Thet Leaf-Bare was the only Leaf-Bare he remembered, and he had only lived through all of the others once.&#160; What if New-Leaf only happened once?&#160; And the other seasons, to?&#160; What season could be next?&#160; What would it be like?&#160; Would it be as unique as the ones they had already lived through?&#160; Would it be full of imaginable colors, absolutely freezing and frigid, warm, new, and full of flowers, or nice and heated without the option of being cold?&#160; Maybe it would be bright like Leaf-Bare, or the opposite.&#160; What would a dark season look like?&#160; The trees turn black, the water a nice obsidian color?&#160; That would sure be interesting, although he knew for sure now that that was just him imagining crazy things again.&#160; The world wasn’t <em>that</em> crazy, was it?</span>

Releasing a small pur, he closed his eyes and enjoyed himself.&#160; He didn’t need to worry too much about hunting or taking care of the clan today… right?&#160; It seemed like the others were taking good care of that right now, and he could always do work later.&#160; In camp.&#160; He knew that he couldn&#39;t hide out inside the walls of the haven as a warrior, but today he didn&#39;t feel the most intent on going out in the forest, especially not alone.&#160; There were foxes, badgers, rouges, dogs, etc.&#160; If he encountered any of those problems, he wouldn’t be able to take care of it himself.&#160; Anyways, he wanted to have a good day today.&#160; It seemed like his worries and anxieties have yet to wake up, and he wanted to take advantage of that.&#160; Who knew how long this would last anyways?&#160; The least he could do was take some time to himself… even if it was only for a few moments.&#160; It wasn’t likely that he would be able to convince himself to truly relax for long.</span>

The molly had known Blurryowl’s name; only through hearing others call the white feline by it, though. It was strange how you could be a part of the same clan and still be complete strangers. Lavendercloud supposed that was good; it meant the clan was doing well if there were so many cats that you hardly knew everyone from more than passing conversations. It also explained the empty fresh kill pile.

<strong>“I’m Lavendercloud.”</strong> The queen chirped, raising her thick-furred tail. <strong>“Let’s get a move on then, shall we?”</strong> With that, the grey she-cat spun around and trotted swiftly towards the camp’s entrance, taking in the cool, fresh air with a satisfied hum as she walked. <strong>”Haven’t seen you around much. Although, that could be due to my imprisonment in the nursery.”</strong> Lavendercloud <em>mrrowed</em> in amusement. Of course, the nursery didn’t feel like a prison. At least, most of the time. She had to admit, the sweet scented den was hardly an unfit place to sleep.</span>

The tom held back a grin after Niftyclaw&#39;s reply, yet his amber gaze held such a light. <strong>&quot;Ah, alright, alright.&quot;</strong> He replied, with a dismissive flick of his tail. Cardinalspark could partially relate to the tom, due to his pride, he certainly wouldn&#39;t go see the medicine cat over something so small. Or something big, to be honest. He let out a breath, ears twitching at the tom&#39;s next response. <strong>&quot;What? Mind you, I don&#39;t...specialize in herbs. Just don&#39;t stick your nose in any flowers and such, you should be fine otherwise.&quot;</strong> He suggested. <strong>&quot;Though, either way, you should at least clean yourself up a bit, hm? Not a very appealing look.&quot;</strong> He said, a look of disgust etched upon his features as he glanced at the scarlet drops.

The pale sun was beginning to climb towards the treetops, the air echoing with birdsong. The dawn patrol had left, and slowly the warriors and apprentices of ThunderClan began to stir, preparing for their duties. Dark amber hues flew open at the very first sounds of activity, and Wrenkit scrambled rather clumsily from her nest inside the nursery. Moss still clinging to her brown and cream pelt, she made her debut into the camp clearing. She was typically one of the first kits out of the nursery in the mornings, as early morning time was her absolute favorite. There was just something about the crisp morning air, and the way the sun lit the trees up golden but had yet to bathe the camp in its light. And quite honestly, Wrenkit loved observing the warriors and apprentices as they went about their tasks. 

She sat silently outside of the nursery, head tipped to the side as her clanmates formed together into patrols and made their way out of the camp, eavesdropping on their chit chat. She listened as apprentices were instructed to fetch fresh bedding for the elders, and the objections of those chosen to check for ticks. The young kitten giggled softly to herself. At just over four moons old, Wrenkit still had a ways to go before she would become an apprentice, but like most kits, she was unbelievably excited to reach her sixth moon. Even the less enjoyable tasks such as ridding the elders of ticks and fetching bedding for them seemed fun for Wrenkit. She couldn’t wait to contribute to her clan. She would be the best, most well behaved apprentice the clan had ever seen! If she could keep her focus, of course. She never could seem to entertain one thing for too long without getting side tracked. Realizing her pelt was still covered in clumps of moss, she began to groom herself, though she never took her eyes off of her surroundings as she did so. Being in camp was so mundane, she had to keep herself entertained somehow.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She had grown used to it by now; she had been teetering on the edge of sleep for her entire life and this was simply the climax of it all: nightmares. She didn’t understand them, didn’t care to understand them, even, and yet on the same side of the coin she had wondered why. It was as if in wonderment that she had wondered why they were there; why they had stayed for so long without leaving for even a day. It shook her up every single time. There were no reason for them, not that she could think of. Except for one: the ghosts of her past. How she had wanted to outrun them, had wanted to get away from them, but there they were. At every corner. Forcing her to relive them even if she didn’t want to. They were insidious, mystifying and intimidating, and, to put it bluntly: she wanted them gone. 

A name for a name, it seemed. Lavendercloud. What a wonderful name that was; so graceful and lively and a name that reminded her of a caprioling breeze on an open field. <em><strong>”Lavendercloud,”</strong></em> she tested the name on her tongue, lips opening into a bright smile. <em><strong>”Well, it’s lovely to meet you, you know,”</strong></em> tufted ears flicked. <em><strong>”The nursery?”</strong></em> she queried as they walked on, clearly curious. <em><strong>”Would it be safe for me to assume that you’re a queen, then? And, if so, what are the kits’ names?”</strong></em> Her breath caught in her throat, heart rate quickening: embarrassment. <em><strong>”Sorry for so many questions, Lav. I’m the curious type, you could say.”</strong></em>

The full moon had made it’s ascent into the starry night sky, illuminating the territories of the clan in it’s bright, silver light. The night of the Gathering was upon them, and they needed to make their way over to the island post-haste. Stepping into the clearing, the tortoiseshell deputy cleared her throat before she addressed her clanmates. <strong>”Let all cats who are old enough to catch their own prey join me at the Gathering!”</strong> she called out to her clanmates with a deep, loud cry, before she began to make her way towards the camp entrance. Like every other clan, they were required to attend, so she didn’t want to be ridiculously late to the whole affair.

She wasn’t going to be heading out into the territory in this mess. Laurelblaze didn’t like cold showers, and the mud that clung to her paws like stubborn, spiky burrs caught in her fur if she passed by a bramble bush. Except it was caked on earth and it was gross and uncomfortable to pick out of her fur or to wash it off. Especially on her large paws, they were magnets for the substance. Luckily she was staying in camp for the day, it was the patrols’ problem now. <em>They’ll probably come back soon anyways, it’ll be a washout anyways. We’ll have to remark the border later on. What a hassle.</em> she let out a small sigh at the thought, more work to handle later, at least until the rainstorm passed. The deputy would have to worry about that later, no use whining about it, it wasn’t like marking a border took too much effort. <strong>”Yeah, wouldn’t want to get caught in a downpour,”</strong> she mused aloud, staring up at the gray skies. More raindrops fell nearby, staining the sand-colored soil nearby with dark beige impact circles. It wasn’t too intense yet, but she still was paying careful attention to it. <strong>”I’m doing well, the kits I adopted with Hollyfrost seem to be settling in a bit... I think. Some of them can be a bit of a pawful.”</strong> she grinned awkwardly at the thought, they were a stubborn bunch, reminded her of herself when she was at their age. As she spoke, the rain seemed to increase in intensity, more and more droplets falling from the sky and hitting the ground in rapid succession.</span>

She shook her head quickly, letting out a small huff before she began to make her way towards one of the more sheltered areas of the camp. Laurelblaze wasn’t going to hide in the warriors den, she wanted to stay outside in camp, get some fresh air at least. The large tortoiseshell glanced up to see one of the outcroppings of stone jutting out from the side of the camp’s walls. It would provide an ample shelter from the rain for the two of them. Taking note of this, the deputy sat down and began to relax as she waited for Blurryowl to join her. This beat standing out there waiting for the rain to soak her fur.

The first thing Aspenpaw noticed once she emerged from the apprentice den was that the ground was cold and wet. Inwardly sighing, she rolled her eyes. The weather had been less than ideal lately. Lifting her paws more carefully, as to avoid mud pools, she continued towards the center of camp, and towards her mentor, Snowstorm. The tall apprentice dipped her head in greeting towards the warrior despite her mood, which corresponded perfectly with the weather.

<strong>”Greetings. What’s on the agenda today?”</strong> The she-cat’s brown tabby fur fluffed up in response to the chill occupying the territory. Her tall ears flicked back as a lone drop of rain splashed on her black nose. Stifling a groan, the apprentice began to groom her slightly dampened fur. It seemed there was a light misting emerging from the clouds. Just perfect.</span>

Snowstorm realized the weather was bad enough today to make his thick white pelt seem to be useless. He responded to Aspenpaw, &quot;Today, we will <em>try</em> to make the best of our time by hunting. I could let you practice fighting moves, but I don&#39;t want the Clan to starve, especially in this <em>horrid</em> weather, and you know what happens at Gatherings when there is a shortage of prey.&quot; As the rain landed on Snowstorm&#39;s white pelt, he fluffed it out and shook himself dry. &quot;Well then, why are you waiting...let&#39;s go hunting before we look like half-drowned mice.&quot;</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">In all honesty, she probably would still be out in the territory had the rain not come when it did. She couldn’t say she blamed Laurelblaze, though; walking in the rain was not for everyone, and she knew that as well as anyone else. How they spent their time was their business and she wasn’t about to intrude on that. Turning her multi-hued gaze to the sky again, a scowl painted her features as she noted just how dismal it looked. StarClan, it was worse than she thought. At Laurelblaze’s musings, she flicked a tufted ear, smiling. <em><strong>”I feel bad for anyone who’s still out in that,”</strong></em> she purred with another great smile.

At the deputy’s comment on kits, her tail flicked behind her. <em><strong>”Oh, yes! It’s good that they’re settling in, then,”</strong></em> another purr left her gullet, her head tilting. <em><strong>”And, yeah. Kits can be a pawful for sure. I’m sure I was quite the pawful when I was a kit,”</strong></em> the joke left her lips without second thought as she maneuvered behind Laurelblaze to get to the nearest enclave. She had to say, this was something to cross off of her bucket list. If she even had one. <em><strong>”Weather is much worse than I thought,”</strong></em> she murmured, mostly to herself as she sat down, curling her tail around her paws, curious to see where the conversation would head next.

She wouldn’t want to trade places with anyone caught in the rain, that was for sure. She might have ended up coming home looking like a mess, muddy fur, debris clinging to her pelt, it wouldn’t have been pretty. Not that she was one to care for beauty standards and all that, but even she thought she would look absolutely horrid. They might think she was a swamp monster that crawled it’s way out of the marshes from ShadowClan’s territory, and she wouldn’t blame them for that. She might have looked twice if she saw some bedraggled creature like that waltzing it’s way into their camp, not that swamp monsters were real or anything. That was silly, monsters only ran down Thunderpaths.

<strong>”Heh, if you think that was bad, I kept trying to escape when I was their age. Except instead of devising a mousebrained plan of leaving entirely, I just wanted to see the territory.”</strong> she snickered quietly, looking back on her times as a kit. She always had that little brand of fire within her, wanting to take on the world by herself. Little Laurelkit would never have thought her life would make so many twists and turns, and where she ended up now. Na&#239;ve yet willing to take on any form of danger, no matter how daunting, she was always brave. A little too much back then, but it served her well nowadays. Maybe her kits would look back on this and realize the same, or have a feeling akin to it. Everyone grew up eventually, she just hoped they learned to adjust to the life of the clan soon enough. She already was attached to them, she’d protect them with her life. <strong>”Kits are so silly, though, they always think they’re as big as the warriors, it’s cute.”</strong>

His milk-tipped ears perked at&#160; the words.&#160; <em><strong><em>”I am?”</em></strong></em> he said.&#160; Marigoldpaw was surprised by what was said, to say the least.&#160; How could he be good company?&#160; He never thought that if he was a different cat and got stuck with a cat like him that he would enjoy it much.&#160; He was awkward, quiet, and not exactly the best at coming up with clear and confident words to share with others.&#160; A small, sheepishly flattered smile spread across his expression.&#160; <em><strong><em>”Thanks… you’re good company too,”</em></strong></em> he said, his smile strengthening as he aimed it towards her.&#160; Honestly, Marigoldpaw hadn’t been the most sure about this small trip when he was first offered the opportunity.&#160; Icestar was intimidating, after all, and it was hard to feel completely normal around her when you were aware that she had a higher place in the clan.&#160; Not only that, but Marigoldpaw knew that Icestar meant business, and the last thing he wanted to do was risk offending or aggravating her.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; He had no clue how he hadn’t managed to do so yet, although the fact that he had been, and still was, going well made him feel more comfortable.&#160; He had mainly forgotten the whole leaving-camp-against-the-rules situation by now, and felt more relaxed and less stressed being by Icestar.&#160; She wasn’t too scary, right?&#160; It didn’t seem so after this, but there was still no way that he was going to try and risk being rude or disrespectful to her or any other cat in the clan.&#160; Basically, he felt a little more inclined to treat Icestar like he would normally treat any other cat now, not that he would forget the fact that she was still his leader.</span>

&#160;&#160;&#160; The soft bristling of the bare branches dragged his attention back to the present.&#160; Briefly looking over the grey-brown and white surroundings, he reminded himself of what they were doing and where they were.&#160; They were about to head back to camp, so he had to prepare to dodge trees and make his pawsteps as quiet as possible.&#160; That way he wouldn’t be heard by any unwanted ears, although he wasn’t completely sure that it would do any help, as he couldn’t cover up his scent without doing too much unnecessary backtracking.&#160; He was with Icestar, anyways.&#160; He should be alright with her.&#160; What rogue would dare attack a leader?&#160; Although, larger animals might still be a problem… no, they were alright.&#160; They just had to head back as they did before and nothing would happen.&#160; He’d done this what seemed to be a thousand times already and nothing bad had happened.&#160; Shaking himself as if to rid his fur of the stress his mind was actively providing, he officially went back to his own unsure reality.&#160; One thing that he wasn’t unsure of, though, was that he was steadily gaining a friend.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As much as the she-cat wouldn’t like to admit it, growing up was hard for her. Perhaps it was the simple thought of responsibility that made her rue it all, or perhaps it was something more. Was it simply the fact that growing up meant that she was closer to death? As silly as that may sound, it might be half-true. For her entire life, she had never taken news of death easily, often secluding herself to somewhere just so that she could be alone. StarClan only knows how she would react when her time had finally come. She didn’t want to think about it. 

At the deputy’s story, Blurryowl let go a sharp and light laugh: the skip of fish in a lake. She had been like that, too. It was always fun to meet people who were similar to you: kindred spirits, they called it. <em><strong>”Believe it or not, I was the same way: I had always wanted to leave the camp, wanted to see what the territory had to offer. But my parents never let me. And then when I became a warrior, I’ve been taking advantage of it ever since,”</strong></em> she purred in response, delving into a story of her own. <em><strong>”They really are. To be honest, I do miss being a kit sometimes, to be free of responsibilities.”</strong></em> she was only half joking, of course.

Short, chubby legs pulled the queen out of the nursery, even though she didn&#39;t have a kit of her own, taking care of her adopted one was just as hard. The short, blueish grey cat made her way to the fresh kill pile, but decided she wasn&#39;t hungry. With a flick of her tail she continued walking until she saw an apprentice sized cat sneezing by the flowers. Chuckling softly, she made her way over to them.</span>

Short ears perked forward when the tom spoke to her, and a warm smile shown on her face, even though every bit of anxiety was tugging at her pelt, telling her to run back to her nest and relax. Accept... she didn&#39;t want to keep acting like that. She wanted to get better at this! With this new goal in mind, she twitched her whiskers and began talking, <strong>&quot;Hello!&quot;</strong> she yelped, a tad bit louder than she wanted, <strong>&quot;I see you&#39;ve discovered an allergy to pollen &#39;ay?&quot;</strong> she chuckled softly once more, soft enough so he knew it wasn&#39;t meant to be rude.</span>

Indeed, childhood was a time that flew by rather quickly. It barely prepared them for the realities of an adult world, and the responsibilities that were thrown upon their little shoulders. Going from playing mossball one day to learning how to prevent themselves from getting killed in battle... It was a stark contrast from the life they knew before. It was the reality for everyone out here, not just clan cats. They all grew up and had to learn how to survive in this harsh environment. It was all that they could do, besides begging some Twoleg for food and becoming their plaything. She refused to submit to that sort of lifestyle, the woods was her hunting grounds, the place she felt most at ease.

Perhaps, her kit self knew this too, that it was where she belonged.

<strong>”I used to daydream about running through the trees, hopping from branch to branch. I also imagined myself taking on so many beasts at once, battling them out one by one.”</strong> she chuckled quietly, while she knew the feeling of the first thought well, the second one was a bit far-fetched, even for a warrior of her strength. The tortoiseshell was powerful, but she didn’t have some form of divine strength on her side. She too was mortal, she too had her weaknesses and flaws. Like any other warrior, she too could be struck down if she wasn’t careful. When she was young, she didn’t understand that, she thought every warrior was unstoppable. She came to learn that it wasn’t the case very quickly.

<em>Such a bleak subject, let’s get back to talking about the cute stuff we did as kits!</em>

<strong>”I miss it, I always talked about conquering the world with my brothers. Especially with my brother Jasper, it was such a simpler time. Still, I’m fond of it.”</strong>

She took a step back when he flinched, hoping she wasn&#39;t too loud. She knew she could be loud at times, and hoped she hadn&#39;t hurt their ears. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m doing alright actually-y. Cosmoskit is playing with other kits so I got some time to walk around camp aha- I&#39;m Slushflight by the way.&quot;</strong> she smiled, <strong>&quot;How&#39;s your day been going?&quot;</strong></span>

<strong>&quot;Well that&#39;s good!&quot;</strong> Slushflight continued to smile, <strong>&quot;Well nice to meet you Lonepaw&quot;</strong> she dipped her head ever so slightly in unison. She... didn&#39;t really understand why cats always dipped their head to <em>her</em>. She was only a queen- She didn&#39;t have her own kit! She&#39;d only adopted one- yet, the clan still seemed to think it was honorable. Which, she knew queens should be respected, but, she just didn&#39;t feel like she deserved respect. <strong>&quot;Haha, I&#39;m sure as you grow, you&#39;ll become immune to the pollen.&quot;</strong> with a gentle giggle she sat near the apprentice.</span>

<em>Lonepaw giggled at her attempt of a nod. He only did it to be formal.</em> “Yes, hopfully i will become immune. By the way, is there something i could get you? Freshkill, fresh bedding?” <em>He scuffed his paw lightly on the ground, trying to hold his eagerness to do something. Sitting and sneezing was something he was kinda done with.

Slushflight slunk back when he giggled, but straightened up, knowing he was only an apprentice. <strong>&quot;Erm... No no! I&#39;m alright, another-r apprentice got me fresh bedding the other day...&quot;</strong> she didn&#39;t like the way apprentices acted these days. As if they were servants! But, she knew it was the only way to straighten up the cocky ones. And, she didn&#39;t mind a little favor here and there... She just wished the apprentices could go be kids while it their childhoods lasted. <strong>&quot;Hm... Actually, there is one thing.&quot;</strong> she looked at the tom, <strong>&quot;I&#39;d have to ask a warrior to watch on Cosmoskit first, but, would you like to go on a stroll around the territory with me? My little legs can still carry me around the woods y&#39;know!&quot;</strong> she giggled as she did a slight elder impression.</span>

<em>Lonepaw jumped up and almost tripped over his own tail, excited to get out of the camp. Finnaly!</em> “Yes! Yes! Yes!” <em>His eyes gleamed brightly then he relized he was acting childish. He should have remember being taught before disipline. He gave a slight shiver from memory but it wasnt very noticable. He cleared his throat and tried again.</em> “I-uhh. I mean yeas please.

She giggled at the sight of the excited apprentice. <strong>&quot;I knew you&#39;d want to go~&quot;</strong> she trotted away to chat with a warrior near by, asking if they&#39;d be willing to watch her kit while she was away. When they agreed, she padded back to the apprentice to tell them the good news. <strong>&quot;We&#39;re ready to go then! Well... are you ready to go?&quot;</strong> she looked back at Lonepaw, excited herself to go out of camp. Maybe she&#39;d even be able to hunt! It&#39;d been <em>moons</em>—or at leats it <em>felt</em> like moons. Even though in reality it&#39;d only been <em>one</em> moon— since she&#39;d came back with prey hanging from her jaws. The last time was with the deputy wasn&#39;t it? <em>Hah, I was such a nervous breakdown back then... I&#39;m at least a little bit better now I suppose.</em></span>

The juicy taste of fresh prey warmed Marigolddust as he took another bite of the bluejay lying at his paws.&#160; Next to him lay a long blue, white, and black feather.&#160; It had become a habit of his to take a feather from every winged meal he had.&#160; They always made his nest feel more homey and gave it a little more color and variety.&#160; He’d yet to get a bluejay feather, and when he spotted the bird in the prey pile that morning he couldn’t help but get excited.&#160; Now, he enjoyed the meal and kept the feather tucked partially underneath him to avoid risking the wind carrying it off into the air.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; The day was peaceful even before he caught sight of the distinct blue prey in the pile of fur and feathers.&#160; The sun was uncovered by any clouds that might have otherwise blanketed up it’s sunny rays, and the grass was no longer covered in snow.&#160; The green hues of the new leaves on the trees seemed to glow under the strong light that the sun provided, bristling softly against one another as gentle, warm breezes pushed and pulled at them.&#160; There were bird tweets in the distance, blessing his ears with the beautiful songs.&#160; He kept himself occupied by watching the cats in the camp pass by and converse with one another.&#160; His thoughts were quite calm for once.&#160; He hadn’t had much interaction yet that day, besides a good-morning greeting with Fernpaw before leaving to be surrounded by all of these other cats, some of them still strangers to him.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; Releasing a relaxed sigh, he set his head down on his paws and enjoyed the warm feeling of the sun’s heat and the occasional bristling of his fur when a downcasted wind brushed past.&#160; It was a nice, peaceful day today, and he enjoyed the quiet that had settled on his thoughts today…</span>

The white and blue femme trotted through the entrance with a gentle smile spread on her face. Feeling the lush grass under her paws was amazing. She hadn&#39;t been out of camp in what <em>felt</em> like moons. She&#39;d definitely have to do this more often- <strong>&quot;Which side of the territory should we explore?&quot;</strong> she asked politely, excitement bubbling in her own fur- she didn&#39;t mind which way... as long as she got to go.</span>

The scent of herbs had filled his senses completely as soon as he woke up, making the transition from sleep to consciousness sharp.&#160; He was used to it by now, and no longer got headaches from it as he had when he first started getting used to the welcome of the morning.&#160; It didn’t take long for him to find himself out and into the camp, taking in the warmer sunlight of the new-leaf.&#160; He was far more fond of this season than he was of the previous one.&#160; He never did gather enough guts to try sliding on the ice- on <em>purpose</em>, that is- or having a snowball fight with anybody else in the clan.&#160; But, although he hadn’t experienced any of the average leaf-bare fun, he was already convinced that he enjoyed collecting flowers and herbs with Fernpaw better.&#160; Flowers weren’t dangerous, anyhow, and danger always made things stressful in his eyes.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; The young warrior let his lemony gaze wander around camp, not quite sure what he should do.&#160; Should he hunt?&#160; Patrol?&#160; He didn’t exactly feel like doing either.&#160; Although, he felt that way every day, so perhaps he should actually give it a try some time.&#160; That way he could rid himself of the horrid feeling of guilt when he didn’t feel useful and the feeling of fear at the thought of actually doing something.&#160; With his dark grey fur absorbing the warmth of the sunlight of the new day he felt groggy and lazy.&#160; Warrior’s weren’t supposed to be lazy… but perhaps he could take a few moments to himself, just to not focus so much on the world outside of camp and anything else that might cause him to stress.&#160; Sauntering over to the side of the camp, he laid down, leaning against the rocky walls of the camp.</span>

Sand and quill swirled away for what seemed like a permanent farewell. It would have been if not for Tigerpaw.

<em>Feather on the loose!</em> Her pink-red eyes widened as the blue plumage soared above her. Instantly the young she-cat&#39;s gaze was marked with a focused excitement, and her muscles not far behind. In a twitch she was flying up in pursuit of it and hooked a chocolate mit in the path of the runaway, slapping it back to the ground. After quickly checking to make sure it&#39;d held its shape, Tigerpaw nipped up the knick-knack and trotted over to Marigolddust.

She set it before the timid warrior and dipped her head. <strong>&quot;I never knew blue jays could still fly after being eaten,&quot;</strong> she joked in greeting, a contagious smile curling on her lips. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

The sun’s rays cast a golden sheen upon the camp in patches, shining through clumps of lime-green pollen and juvenile leaves. While the mornings were typically quiet for ThunderClan, today seemed to be an exception. She could see more and more cats in the clearing, though it made sense. The days were getting longer, daylight was emerging even in the earliest hours of dawn. It provided a silent wake-up-call to the rest of ThunderClan— <em>it’s daytime, time to get to work.</em> Though for Laurelblaze, she never had any trouble getting up early. She always was a morning person. <em>Early bird catches the worm.</em> a mantra she often repeated to herself whenever she arose from her nest.

Her apprentices hated her for waking them up at such StarClan-forsaken hours, though she’d hold off for now. Tigerpaw and Bouncepaw each deserved their rest after all the training she put them through.

The ThunderClan deputy had a lot of expectations set for herself and by others. She wanted to be a paragon of a warrior, a role model for the kits and apprentices to follow. A future leader who could command respect from every single one of her warriors, as well as being the right-hand of her leader. The russet-toned tortoiseshell pushed herself each and every single day, often to the point of exhaustion. She had to serve her clan to the utmost degree, providing stability and protection in the most dire of times. Everything she did was for the betterment of ThunderClan. Her clan was practically her family, and it <em>included</em> her kits and kin.</span>

Twin hues of honey-amber and sea-blue were narrowed as the sun shined it’s blinding white light into her line of sight, momentarily opening once she’d regained her vision. The deputy let out a rather significant yawn, exposing her large, pearly fangs to the world around her— though if she didn’t admit that she exaggerated her motions a bit, she’d be lying. She liked to imagine she was a lion emerging into the sun, baring her teeth to the world and bowing to no one. Just her being flashy, nothing more, Laurelblaze just wanted to do that for kicks. Once she was finished with her dramatic display of her might, she stretched out her stiffened limbs that still felt atrophied from her hours of slumber. Once she felt them crack, a sign they were reinvigorated with energy in her eyes, she let out a pleased sigh as she stood back up— her bushy tail waving around behind her excitedly. <em>Now</em>, she was ready to take on the day.

The lengths of the days were becoming longer, and the warmth in the air held a hint of what was to come later on. As the seasons continued to change, their impacts were left quite obvious - almost as a non-physical scar upon the ground. The plants that were once dead were now seeming to pop back into place, reinvigorated with the coming seasons of warmth and heat. The change was rather dramatic, however. Some days bordered on cold, whilst others were hot or humid - it was always a gamble on what was to come as the season change disliked being predictable.

A certain calico apprentice seemed rather disinterested in this change, however, and merely resorted to lounging in the clearing as she had no current tasks. Her long cheek fur was splayed around her paws, too long to fully keep off of the ground. It was rather annoying keeping the fur clean at times, but the apprentice seemed to do whatever she could to look her absolute best for those around her. She had high hopes that one day someone would fall in love with how gorgeous she was, and fawn after her like a love-sick kitten. That had yet to happen though, so Sorrelpaw just resorted to dreaming about it.

As a loud yawn seemed to catch her attention, the feline&#39;s head turned toward where the clan deputy, Laurelblaze, was currently showing off whatever she could as she welcomed the morning. The apprentice flicked in ear in mild distaste - the only <em>allowed</em> to be flashy should be her. She most certainly had the looks for it, right? The thought of her even being second in terms of appearance or physical strength made her nose crinkle slightly, and she flicked her tail in mild irritation. Sorrelpaw was the best in appearance - she should be the only one who was able to show off her gorgeously patterned coat, not the clan deputy!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A small huff was quick to escape her jaws, although if Laurelblaze happened to look the apprentice&#39;s way, she would only offer a sickeningly sweet smile in return. Couldn&#39;t have anyone suspecting her of not being genuine, right? Despite that fact that most of her clanmates knew her as a totally stuck-up jerk who either flirted or pranked them just for the kicks of it half the time, she should still be on her &#39;best&#39; behavior, right? No one could find fault with her if she didn&#39;t give them a practical reason to, and that was what she was determined not to do - not to give them a reason. Plus, Icestar couldn&#39;t punish her if a cat went up to her and complained of Sorrelpaw&#39;s <em>smiling</em>... right? The thought of being punished made her shudder.

After a quick second, the apprentice went on to groom her fur, feigning disinterest in what was going on around her.

While Laurelblaze did indeed like to be flashy, it was not out of vanity. Her appearance was far from the beauty standard, not with all the scars that lined her body— and noticeably around her face. She had an underbite that left her with a snaggletooth, and her muscular, towering frame made her resemble a beast more so than a feline. When she was younger, she considered her mother to be the most beautiful cat in the world— and she somewhat resembled her in appearance, at least compared to her and her father. Maybe in another life, she’d be a “beauty”, but here she was a rugged warrior, scarred from past battles she’d served in. Reminders that she’d survived them to continue protecting her clan. She’d trade in life and limb if it meant keeping her clanmates safe. That was the strength of her dedication to ThunderClan, her loyalty was unfettering.

Besides, the only cat she only really needed to look pretty around was her mate Hollyfrost, and even then, that wasn’t exactly was won over her beloved anyways. They both were spirited she-cats, and they bonded over their loyalty to their clan, took them forever to work out their feelings.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">While she’d stood back up, her gaze drifted over towards a young calico molly who’d been sprawled out across a large boulder— grooming her fur. <em>Apprentices these days... Where is her mentor to keep them occupied?</em> perhaps she was speaking from personal experience, as kindhearted as her mentor, Rockfall, was, he was a strict teacher. Though she considered herself better off for it, her work ethic was phenomenal— though she always was an ambitious type. Ever since she was a kit she’d dreamed of becoming the leader of their clan, and she was sure her past self would be proud of how far she’d come... Though there was a lot of hardship along the way. Too much pain, too much death. Perhaps that was why she was so mindful of her clanmates, where they were, what they were doing. It was all a part of her efforts in keeping them safe at all times. Maybe they just didn’t feel the same, that thought scared her. Surely it wasn’t true, though, she might just be reading into it too much. Laurelblaze was a bit... Adamant about her service to the clan, even when she was young. Back then, all her thoughts were to impress the others and to become a cat who could be a potential leader. Though she didn’t do it through the best means all the time. Maybe they weren’t as inclined to recklessness as she was.

<strong>”I sure hope you’re not going to spend all day lounging around in camp, it’s a lovely day today!”</strong> she called out the young apprentice from afar, deciding to see how she’d react. Laurelblaze always loved to mess around with the younger members of her clan, playing games with them. Be it kits or apprentices, she always strived to get along with them. Perhaps that was partially why she adopted so many kits, and wasn’t stopping anytime soon.

The sweet newleaf breeze cascaded in gentle waves though the rocky quarry. With it came the pungent scent of wildflower and fresh soil. Icestar inhaled a huge breath, savouring the fresh air from her Highledge perch. The lynx-point stood proudly on the outcrop of rock, letting her paws grip the edge firmly. It was such a pleasant day out with the sun shining and the birds singing in the distance. It was a perfect day for a hunt!

The idea having already set on her adamant mind, the ThunderClan leader retreated from her position and made her way down to the clearing of the camp. Life buzzed everywhere. Kits danced around after a stray butterfly. Queens lounged in the shade and shared tongues. <em>Probably gossiping about the latest news,</em> Icestar mused with amusement. A few stray warriors were found taking a break and munching on a rabbit or squirrel. Prey was plentiful enough to afford filling their bellies! Sea-green hues searched for a friend or two, hoping to drag one off with her.

It took a few moments for the young tom to realize that his feather had been swept up into the wind.  Once he did take notice, though, he stiffened and attempted to catch it through raising a milk-touched paw, only to miss it by a few seconds.  Getting onto his paws, he went to follow it before he realized that not just his eyes were watching the feather as it flew through the matching color of the sky.  His lemon-colored hues caught sight of a brown tabby she-cat, more than likely an apprentice, and realized that she was intent on catching it.  He hesitated, one paw slightly raised, as he watched how the hunt progressed.  Fortunately, Tigerpaw caught it under a paw.  

              The first questions that came to mind were whether or not he would be returned the feather.  Even though he had become an apprentice around two or three moons ago, he still couldn&#39;t help but feel like there was a large majority of them who might not have seen or cared where the feather came from and whether or not it belonged to another cat.  Even though he could easily spare the feather and just get another one in the future, it was always a disappointment to see that you had something so beautiful in your paws and let it be swept from your grasp, feather or not.  

             Despite his guesses on where the feather might end up, it didn&#39;t take long for the stranger apprentice to approach him.  When the feather was set down, he reluctantly raised a paw and kept the feather firmly underneath.  He made sure sure it wouldn&#39;t be swept away again unless some gust of wind stronger than he had felt all New-Leaf captured it before focusing his attention back to the feather saver.</span>

 As always, a nervous smile found itself spreading across his expression.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Yeah...&quot;</em></strong></em> was all he could think to say to accompany an airy laugh, and he immediately scolded himself over it.  What an awkward way to respond to a joke!  He hoped this wasn&#39;t foretelling the future for the conversation.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Thank you for catching it, by the way.&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, his tail swaying softly behind him as if to wave away the stress that always accompanied a conversation with a new cat.   <em><strong><em>&quot;You&#39;re good at hunting, right?  You caught that swifter than I expected I would,&quot;</em></strong></em> he added.  Well, that wasn&#39;t half bad.  Perhaps he could save his side of the conversation.  <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

Yawning, the tabby cat padded out of the warrior&#39;s den. Strikethroat had wanted to sleep some more, but decided against it, and chose instead to do something with the sunny day. They walked over to the edge of the shade and sat down, looking around. It was no surprise that the camp looked very busy, as the weather was just like a good day in an elder&#39;s story. 

As Strikethroat watched, they began to wash themselves. The sun energized the tired cat a little, and they started longing to go hunting. They were brought back to the time when Strikethroat was still an apprentice, and fondly remembered trying to get on any patrol or hunt they could be on.</span>

<em>Where in StarClan is Bearmask or Hollyfrost? Marigolddust? Laurelblaze?</em> A storm began to brew in her teal optics as she searched relentlessly for her friends but it seemed that they were quite busy today. Not one was found to be in her sights. A delicate frown twisted her white muzzle and the lynx-point’s ocean eyes latched onto a warrior, Strikethroat, whom was innocently staring off into the distance after finishing their grooming.

Icestar tipped her head to the side whilst watching them studiously. <em>It wouldn’t hurt to ask them,</em> she reasoned in her head. After all, while she thoroughly enjoyed her solitary hunts, it was always better to be with a Clanmate or two. 

With her prey in sight, the ThunderClan leader casually made her way over to the warrior, feathery banner waving in the air in relaxed strokes. <strong>” Hey Strikethroat!”</strong> Icestar called. <strong>” Want to come hunting with me?”</strong>

At the sound of Icestar&#39;s offer, Strikethroat turned their head. Smiling, the tabby warrior nodded. They got up from their comfortable spot, and padded over to the Thunderclan leader. Now that they were covered in the sun, their fur felt warm and pleasant. 

&quot;It&#39;s been a while since I hunted, hopefully my skills are still alright. &quot; Strikethroat joked, their tail swishing from side to side in excitement. They licked their chest fur once more, and looked around. &quot;It looks like a nice day for hunting. &quot; The silver cat remarked. &quot;Prey should be starting to come out. &quot; Even though Strikethroat was only 18 moons old, the warrior sometimes felt like an elder, as they remembered how energetic they were when they were an apprentice.</span>

The end of her ringed tail flicked up in acknowledgement, and an added layer of cheer graced her tabby features. <strong>&quot;No problem,&quot;</strong> chirped the youth, wanting to sound casual but unable to keep the merriment from her voice. The wind buffeted her chocolatey fur, giving her a messy look that suited her. She blinked open her eyes onto Marigolddust once more and stood tall, long sleek tail swishing behind her in a relaxed manner. This rookie had her fair share of confidence, for sure. <em>You bet I&#39;m fast- and just you wait, I&#39;m going to be the best hunter around the lake,</em> was what she wanted to say. Instead, Tigerpaw gave a humble dip of her head, something that had taken at least a second or third thought to muster. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

<em>A while?</em> A nonexistent brow shot up immediately in suspicion. <em>Had they not been doing their duty as a warrior?</em> Fortunately for Strikethroat, Icestar finally caught up with the light-hearted joke. Unfortunately for the warrior, she didn’t find it amusing at all. Why would not feeding their Clan be an object of laughter? She definitely didn’t find it funny if her Clanmates around her were starving to death. 

<strong>&quot; I hope that&#39;s the case. A warrior should never neglect hunting for their Clan,&quot;</strong> she warned lightly, a frown upon her masked features. <strong>” It is a nice day for hunting,”</strong> she echoed in agreement as the conversation continued on. <strong>” The warm breeze should tempt many prey animals out of their burrows and right into our claws.”</strong> The silvery-white femme flexed her ivory weaponry for emphasis. 

<strong>” Let’s get right to it!”</strong> Their victims weren’t going to be waiting around all day to be caught. They were on a time limit.

Strikethroat nodded, noting to be more careful of their words next time. <em>Maybe I should&#39;ve said something else as a joke.</em> The silver warrior thought as they nodded, smiling as the Clan Leader made a comment about the warm weather. &quot;Yes, &quot; Strikethroat mewed, eyeing Icestar&#39;s sharp claws,&quot;The prey will never know what hit them. If this nice weather keeps up, then the clan won&#39;t go hungry for a while. &quot;  

The tabby cat&#39;s tail shot up a little, excited to go hunting. They glanced at the fresh-kill pile momentarily as they got up, and quickly ran over to the camp exit.</span>

Sparrowpaw nervously paced next to Sandstride. Why was it so awkward? She entered the camp quickly with her friend. Glancing at Sandstride. She couldn’t tell if the warrior wanted to talk or be left alone. So she hovered uncertainly.</span>

Evening had fallen over the ThunderClan camp, half of it ablaze with golden sunlight while the rest succumbed to the shadows. For Wrenkit, this was a wonderful time of day. Soon, the day would be over, and she could be on to the next. Why the hurry to jump to tomorrow? Well, the young brown and white molly was mere days away from reaching her fifth moon, and that meant her sixth moon was so close she could <em>taste</em> it. Aside from that though, dusk was the <em>perfect</em> time to catch bugs. Unlike some kittens, Wrenkit was very good at keeping herself entertained within the walls of the camp. Sure, she couldn’t wait to be an apprentice and be able to explore the territory, but she still found enjoyment in the confinement. When she wasn’t observing her clanmates as they went about their duties, or playing with a moss ball or feather, the young femme could be found chasing bugs. Any sort really. Beetles were great stalking practice, and anything that flew was just a joy to leap around and chase after. 

Blazing amber eyes locked onto a cricket as it hopped about near the walls of the camp. <strong>”What’s this? An intruder?”</strong> Wrenkit sunk low to the ground, wriggling her haunches and propelling herself forwards, pinning the cricket beneath white forepaws. She could feel it wriggling against her paw pads, and she suppressed a giggle. <strong>”That tickles!”</strong> She lifted her paws and allowed it to hop a few more paces away, before she pounced for it again. This time, it managed to elude her clumsy paws, but not her pink nose as she nudged it into the air, sending it flying a few tail lengths away. She approached it slowly this time, observing it with her head tilted. The cricket seemed tired, she thought. Gently, Wrenkit nudged the cricket into the undergrowth at the border of the camp, deciding it was best to find a new bug to play with. She didn’t want to kill anything she didn’t plan on eating, and she certainly wasn’t about to eat a cricket.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">distracted as any kit, Wrenkit quickly turned her attention to a moth that fluttered half way across the camp, sprinting towards it and leaping into the air below, touching it lightly with her nose. Moths, she had learned, were very delicate. She had accidentally maimed or murdered her fair share, and she knew now it was better to chase it than to try to catch it. He still enjoyed following it around the camp, leaping at it every now and again but avoiding any contact apart from a gentle nose boop. Some of her clanmates may have thought she was getting a bit old for such kit like behavior, but she thought that was nonsense. She was still a kit. She would have plenty of time to be serious when she was an apprentice. Without any duties to fulfill, she was simply keeping herself in shape by playing so much. Besides, the young she kit seemed very aware that one day she wouldn’t have time to play like this, and that kithood should be enjoyed before it was gone. Finally, panting with exhaustion, Wrenkit flopped down outside of the nursery entrance, watching the moth as it disappeared into the evening sky.</span>

The shift into nighttime typically meant that he needed to trek back up to the Highledge and head to sleep, but Coyotekit felt a strange fit of restlessness. Typically he was not one to protest going to sleep, he wouldn’t dare defy the will of the ThunderClan leader... <em>His mom</em>. Yet tonight, he just needed to walk around a bit more, spend a few more minutes in camp during twilight hours before he hit the hay. The young tom had been padding around the immediate area surrounding the rocks that led up to the Highledge. His leaf-green gaze flashed lightly under the darkness, like most creatures’ did in low-light conditions. He’d picked up on noise coming from nearby, and a familiar voice belonging to a kit. <strong>”Wrenkit?”</strong> he spoke aloud, spotting the she-kit off towards the other side of camp, pouncing on random objects he couldn’t make out from this distance. If he were right, he’d assume she was hunting nocturnal bugs, the crickets always came out around this hour, and he’d seen other kits doing this. He didn’t understand the appeal of potentially getting bug guts smeared all over his paws, but to each their own. He collected bones for a hobby, he shouldn’t be talking anyways.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The pale-furred tabby tom padded towards the familiar kit with an intrigued expression, his long tail held up behind him like a banner. <strong>”What are you doing?”</strong> he asked quietly, noticing the small moth his clanmate had recently caught fluttering away from her grasp. <em>So she was hunting bugs...</em> he glanced back down towards the she-kit with an understanding expression. <strong>”Are you staying up too? I can’t sleep right now.”</strong> this was a common feeling, he noted, even amongst adults. He did like the nighttime, he never was afraid of the dark. Considering he was getting used to crawling into dark crevices just to reach his bone collections that littered around the dark corners of ThunderClan’s camp to not everyone’s knowledge. Though the young tom was getting bigger now, he was four moons old, and he found himself struggling to find new places to hide his collections in. He was outgrowing them, much like how a child outgrew their toys. A reminder of how he was not going to be a kit forever, not able to keep up with this hobby of his like he could when he was younger. He didn’t like it, though he knew he had to accept and face that reality sooner or later. Kithood did not last forever.

<strong>”I can hang out here, if you want. Better than just being by yourself.”</strong> normally the young tom wasn’t exactly the most sociable of cats, he didn’t like crowds in the slightest, but he knew Wrenkit. She didn’t judge him for his hobbies, and even helped him, so he figured she wasn’t too bad to have around. A... <em>friend</em>... Maybe?

As the sun made it’s ascent into the morning sky, the deputy of ThunderClan realized it was time to send out sun-high patrols. Already tasking a few others with hunting patrols earlier in the day, she decided to head up a border patrol to renew the scent markers by the WindClan border. Laurelblaze was mostly doing this to ensure that the one badger she and Icestar had encountered there had not returned after she led another patrol to drive it out of the territory. If it had brains, it would know to steer clear of their land, otherwise she and the others were going to have to teach it another harsh lesson. The tortoiseshell only hoped that it was not the case, nobody mentioned any signs of badgers encroaching upon their territory lately, so she was optimistic about their chances.

<strong>”Strikethroat, Marigolddust!”</strong> she called out to some of the warriors she spotted in camp, before she glanced up at the Highledge with a curious expression. <strong>”...And Icestar! You wanna join in on this patrol I’m heading up?”</strong> she called out to the lynx-point femora from below. She ruffled her thick pelt for a moment, before waiting for the two cats she called out to to join her in the clearing.

Amber eyes met green as a familiar voice greeted her ears, lips curling into a friendly grin. <strong>”Coyotekit! Hi,”</strong> she said cheerfully. Wrenkit remembered the last time she had seen the tom she’d been helping him find a new hiding spot for his bone collection. She wondered if he’d managed to keep them hidden this time, or if some pesky adult had located them and tossed them out. She hoped that no one had discovered them, because she thought perhaps Coyotekit would show her his collection one day, and she really wanted to see it. She looked around, checking to see if any cats nearby could be potentially eavesdropping on their conversation. When she spoke, her tone was hushed. <strong>”Has any cat found your bones again? Did you find a good hiding spot?”</strong> She inquired, tipping her head to the side. She knew how upset he had looked the last time he’d discovered his bones had been taken, and she didn’t want to see him like that again. She liked it when her friends were happy, and she supposed she and Coyotekit were friends now, right? Any cat who spoke to her more than once was considered a friend in her book. 

She was momentarily distracted by another insect that fluttered across her field of vision, tail tip twitching excitedly, though she made no move to catch it. She returned her attention to the tom-kit. <strong>”I was chasing bugs,”</strong> she admitted. <strong>”I like to practice my stalking and pouncing on them. Plus, they’re sorta cool to look at,”</strong> she said. With little than a moon until she’d be made an apprentice, Wrenkit was practicing her hunting skills on anything and everything that she could. Marigolddust had helped her improve her hunters crouch, and she was determined to get even better at it and impress whoever her future mentor would be. She smiled, gaze flitting to the darkening sky above. <strong>”I’ll probably stay awake for a bit longer. I like to watch the stars come out,”</strong> she explained, rolling onto her back</span>

A quiet purr rumbled in her chest at bud question, and she nodded eagerly in response. <strong>”I’d like it if you stayed to hang out for a bit. There will be plenty of time for sleeping later,”</strong> she mused. 

Wrenkit would rather be outside than tossing and turning in her nest, and now that she had some company she was content to stay outside until she was tired enough to sleep. <strong>”I’m only a moon away from becoming an apprentice,”</strong> she said suddenly, looking up at Coyotekit. <strong>”What do you think it will be like? I’m excited but... I don’t know. A bit nervous, I suppose.”</strong> To her it didn’t seem like the other kits got anxious about becoming an apprentice. It was all they talked about, and it seemed like nothing excited them more in the world. Wrenkit was ready to earn her apprentice name and serve her clan, of course, but she wondered what sort of apprentice she would be. Would she live up to her clans expectations? Would she let them down? Could she handle the responsibilities, or learn all of the battle moves? She supposed only time would tell.</span>

It didn’t take long for the young warrior to arrive at Laurelblaze’s side after being summoned.&#160; His ears were perked and his head slightly tipped to the side.&#160; He had already guessed that this was a patrol, although he wasn’t sure what type quite yet.&#160; A hunting patrol or a border patrol?&#160; Either one made him a little nervous, if only because he was worried about the previous trouble with badgers.&#160; He hadn’t been out of a patrol after the news quite yet, and he never strayed far from the camp once the event had reached his ears.&#160; Badgers were something that he didn’t want to deal with.&#160; Not that he had ever dealt with one before, but he heard lots of stories.&#160; They were large and ferocious, willing to kill a cat for any reason that they found necessary.&#160; He always doubted a single cat could take down one of the beasts, let alone himself.&#160; So, if he completely dodged the risk he decided he would be fine.&#160; This patrol might be the deciding factor on whether or not the badger wasn’t going to return.&#160; Little stories like this always seemed to be given more attention by him than larger ones, such as the Shiny family or Hazelhues.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; But, enough of that worried thinking.&#160; From what it seemed like, he would be with another warrior, Laurelblaze, and Icestar on this patrol.&#160; If any badger did come they should be handled… hopefully.&#160; <em><strong><em>”I’m here,”</em></strong></em> he chirped once he had gotten over his thoughts, although it wasn’t likely that he had gone unnoticed until now.&#160; It was an okay day, and not one that he wanted to be ruined by any sour or startling ideas he came up with.</span>

<em>No problem.</em>  Well, that was an okay answer.  The only problem with it was that <em>he</em> had to figure out how to continue whatever had started in the conversation.  What should he say?  What would work?  Would the apprentice rather just go off and go on with her day?  That didn&#39;t sound like it would be surprising, but she wasn&#39;t leaving yet, so she mustn&#39;t want to, right?  With the swerve of an ear, he tried to come up with something new to say.  What would Skycloud say?  She must have mentioned something to him about conversation.  She was his mentor, after all.  <em>Mentor?</em>  An Idea came to him.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Who&#39;s your mentor?  They must be teaching you pretty well, unless you made yourself better by practicing yourself,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said.  Alright, that was alright.  

            Marigolddust himself had never actually practiced without Skycloud.  He didn&#39;t understand how any cat could.  How did they knew that they didn&#39;t mess it up somehow?  He felt that he would have surely messed up his teaching somewhere.  It seemed he was only okay at hunting, patrolling, and doing other life skills because of the silver pelted fem.  It would have been nice if she was still his mentor, but instead he had more responsibility now.  Maybe he could become the Skycloud to a different apprentice.  Not that he believed he would be any good at it.  <em>Oh, Starclan please say that i&#39;ll do alright when the time comes...</em>  He silently prayed.  <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

The silver warrior licked their paw once more, and padded over to the tortoiseshell. <em>I hope this is a hunting patrol...</em> The large warrior thought as they sat down. <strong>&quot;Sure, why not? &quot;</strong> Strikethroat mewed in response to Laurelblaze&#39;s offer. <strong>&quot;Is this a hunting patrol? &quot;</strong> They asked as they looked around for Icestar. As they looked at the fresh-kill pile, they began to feel a bit hungry. Even if it was a border patrol, the tabby decided that they would try to catch at least something.</span>

The tabby warrior padded over to the fresh-kill pile, chose a skinny vole, and padded back to the edge of the clearing. They looked around, looking for someone that might be able to talk with them. They bent down and took a large bite out of the vole, and lifted their head back up. As they scanned the busy clearing, they spotted their sibling, Kaleblink. <strong>&quot;Kaleblink! Get something from the fresh-kill pile, and come over here, you fat cat. &quot;</strong> Strikethroat called out.</span>

The &#39;fat&#39; cat padded over to Strikethroat. Annoyed that they called them fat, of anything. <strong>&quot;Rude! My hair&#39;s long, I&#39;m not fat, Strikethroat!&quot;</strong> Kaleblink bent down and took a bite out of a mouse.</span>

Strikethroat choked back a laugh as they chewed on the vole, grinning. <strong>&quot;Well, so is mine, but at least I look more handsome! &quot;</strong> The large warrior boasted jokingly, their fluffy tail sticking up in the air. <strong>&quot;You&#39;re just jealous that I get to go out on more patrols than you. &quot;</strong> The silver tabby added as they finished their vole and started to wash. <strong>&quot;You haven&#39;t gone on a patrol since you got your apprentice name! &quot;</strong> They joked in-between licks.</span>

Kaleblink rolled their eyes. <strong>&quot;If you&#39;re sooo hAnDsOmE, tell me, who are you dating? Hm?&quot; </strong> <em>You&#39;re not even CLOSE to handsome anyways.</em> But Kaleblink decided not to say that out loud, it was true that their sibling, Strikethroat, had gone out on more patrols then Kaleblink. They didn&#39;t want their last words to be an insult and then get slaughtered by Striekthroat.</span>

<strong>&quot;Just because I&#39;m handsome doesn&#39;t mean I want to have a mate! &quot;</strong> Strikethroat meowed, as the silver tabby lay down and stretched their limbs. <strong>&quot;I don&#39;t see you having a mate or a crush either, buzzard-face. &quot;</strong> The silver cat then remembered the previous conversation about patrols. <strong>&quot;We should go on a patrol together.

In fact, it only grew wider and brighter with the tom warrior&#39;s next question. <strong>&quot;Laurelblaze,&quot;</strong> she blurted, just under an ear-splitting chirp. She tried her best to be humble, but what was cooler than being under the wing of the clan&#39;s deputy, and future leader? Tigerpaw remember that day not so long ago - only a few moons - when her mentor had been named. She&#39;d been too excited to be intimidated by the giant torbie, being more concerned with either feinting or watching her soul leave her body for StarClan&#39;s hunting grounds early. She was already good at hunting, and she&#39;d be a tricky fighter to beat too, with Laurelblaze&#39;s guidance up her sleeve.

But she refused to give the admirable she-cat all the credit. Tigerpaw cleared her throat and straightened, quickly adding, <strong>&quot;But I practice on my own too. All the time, actually.&quot;</strong> She wanted so badly to show off to him, and paused for a heartbeat to search his honey colored eyes for any hint of interest, then went ahead with her offer anyway. <strong>&quot;Hey, you should take me on patrol. I can show you what I can do- You won&#39;t be disappointed.&quot;</strong> Eyes of fuschia rounded in plea.

Laurelblaze’s call sent a pleasant chill of excitement verberating through her. She had been anchored in camp this entire morning, chasing down her mischievous kits and getting them out of whatever trouble they had been diving headfirst into. <em>What is with Coyotekit’s weird fascination with bones!?</em> She thought incredulously as she had caught the young tom innocently stashing one away behind the warrior’s den.  

The silvery-white molly looked up into the heterochromatic gaze of ThunderClan’s deputy. It had been a shame she hadn’t been on the patrol to drive the badger away but the sprain she had gotten from her race with Laurelblaze had sentenced her to a full day in the leader’s den until it got better.

 <strong>” I’m up for it!”</strong> She called out cheerfully, making her way over. Marigolddust and Strikethroat… These three were going to make an interesting combination.

The bulky tomcat re-entered the camp, feet and face damp from the stream before he dropped the fish off into the fresh kill pile. He trotted a few paces away before sitting down and he licked his paws and claws clean.</span>

They had all gathered together at last, <em>Good, then we can be on our way!</em> she thought with a satisfied grin. She dipped her head to the group in acknowledgement, before she finally spoke up to elucidate them on the situation at hand. <strong>&quot;I sent out hunting patrols this morning, but I wanted to lead a quick border patrol out by the stream by the WindClan border. I just want to make sure that badger we drove out earlier this moon hasn&#39;t returned. After the walloping we gave it, I highly doubt it&#39;s made a return, but you never know with those things.&quot;</strong> her gaze narrowed for a moment, and her tone grew serious. <strong>&quot;Now I don&#39;t expect to run into it, but always be on your guard. That being said, just focus on marking the border so it, or it&#39;s friends know to stay away.&quot;</strong>

Her stance relaxed as her bushy tail dropped down behind her, her typical, easy-going expression returning to her features as she looked upon her clanmates. This was going to be quick and easy, she hoped, but she was not going to tempt fate. <strong>&quot;Let&#39;s move out while the sun is still up, shall we?&quot;</strong> she nodded to the group as she made an about-face for the camp entrance, leading the way out to the woods through the narrow passageway.

This might have been the first patrol that Marigolddust had been assigned to where he knew the majority of the cats.&#160; The only cat he didn’t exactly know well was Strikethroat, which caused a little more anxiety to stir up inside of his chest.&#160; Otherwise, his companions didn’t give him much worry at all.&#160; Maybe some intimidation, but otherwise he was comfortable with who Laurelblaze had chosen.&#160; The small announcement that the deputy shared was what caused him to worry the most.&#160; He was split on whether he should think of this patrol as a relaxed one with little to no worries or one where he had to always stay alert for any dangers to come from any direction.&#160; There didn’t seem to be any inbetween for the tom, and that provided him with far more troubles than he wished it had.&#160; But, he just had to focus on the goal of the patrol: remain a <em>little</em> cautious and do a good job marking the territories to further eliminate the threat.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; As Laurelblaze suddenly became serious Marigolddust tensed.&#160; He couldn’t help but stiffen or get nervous when the tortie became so stern with any subject, even if it was a fake expression.&#160; Fortunately it didn’t last all that long, and as she relaxed he did, to.&#160; He aimed his golden hues towards the sky, examining where the sun was.&#160; Squinting, he just gave an upward glance before looking in front to him again and nodding.&#160; Giving himself a small shake as if to shake off some of his nerves, he swiftly padded forwards in pursuit of Laurelblaze, slipping through the entryway with ease and sticking close to the rest of the group.</span>

Kits always treated the title of “friend” so loosely, though he figured it couldn’t hurt to not be a complete social recluse from the rest of the clan.  Besides, she wasn’t annoying or anything, and seemed genuinely interested in the things he had to say. So... She was <em>alright</em> in his book, he could consider her a friend. <strong>”Nobody’s taken them yet, but I’m having trouble accessing them. I’m getting too big to crawl through the spaces.”</strong> that was the truth, the young tom had been going through a growth spurt, and it wasn’t stopping. His legs were starting to get all long and gangly, and he found himself tripping over his paws a lot more than before. He was going to be a lanky cat, that was for sure, he might end up resembling a WindClanner when he was finally grown. Ironic considering the WindClan leader was present for his and his siblings births, not that he remembered it. He was blind and deaf, didn’t even know of her existence. Not yet, anyways.

<strong>”So, you’re practicing your hunting skills before you become an apprentice?”</strong> it was a pretty logical conclusion, many kits did that just to impress their mentors with their work ethic. They wanted to show off, that they were going to be the greatest apprentice ever trained. Half the kits in the nursery had aspirations of leadership, that they were going to receive their nine lives from StarClan and lead the clan into a new tomorrow. He ought to ask his mother what it was like, he might actually give them a reality check. Not to be a killjoy, but to get them to focus on actually doing something fun for themselves rather than focus on something so... serious, and so, <em>so</em> far away in the future. He might be quiet and reserved, but he could be quite perceptive and knowledgeable if he wanted to be. It was just in his nature, though he mostly concerned himself with guarding his collections of bones while he still could reach his paws in to grab them.</span>

The outcropping wouldn’t be his den for much longer, or ever again. He’d be living in the apprentices’ den, then the warriors’ den, and one day, the elders’ den, if he made it that far. It was weird, and some part of him felt disappointed, he liked waking up high above the rest of camp, looking down from that perch... Though he knew it wouldn’t last forever. He had a lot riding on his shoulders for being the leader’s son, and he was going to prove it to his mother that he and his siblings were ready for their apprenticeships once they were of age. <strong>”I wanna make sure she knows I’ll be okay.

It was definitely a good thing that the apprentice didn’t take much mind to his moments of thought.&#160; He never liked to keep others waiting for him to say something, and believing that she didn’t care gave him confidence.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; <em><strong><em>”Laurelblaze?”</em></strong></em> he repeated, startled.&#160; Why had he not expected her mentor to be a cat like Laurelblaze?&#160; Perhaps it was because the idea of any high rank having an apprentice seemed completely unreal to him.&#160; At his own ceremony and others that he had watched he had never really witnessed a cat being apprenticed to Laurelblaze or Icestar.&#160; The only time that he watched a high rank appoint an apprentice was when Fernpaw was made the medicine cat apprentice, which made sense, as he couldn’t see himself ever missing a single one of her ceremonies, even if they wouldn’t share her next one.&#160; She was there a his anywho, even though she hadn’t been one to gain a rank that day.&#160; There was no way that he wouldn’t do the same for her when the time came.&#160; It was odd, the fact that medicine cat apprentices had to wait so long to become a full on medicine cat.&#160; Why couldn’t they gain a rank at the same time as the other apprentices of the clan?&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; Shaking his head free of the thoughts, he tried to focus all of his attention on the conversation, using the pink-eyed tabby in front of him as an anchor.&#160; <em><strong><em>”Laurelblaze must be a good mentor, huh?”</em></strong></em> he said with a smile.&#160; It seemed like Laurelblaze had a good match here with the apprentice.&#160; Tigerpaw seemed excited, determined, and skilled like he expected Laurelblaze might have been when she was an apprentice, and now, for that matter.&#160; His audits perked when she gave some credit to herself, to.&#160; Oddly enough, Marigolddust c=found his words running more smoothly now that he actually knew about the topic and what he could say.</span>

He was interested in what words he heard and said enough for his own sentence to run out of his mouth like a stream into a river.&#160; <em><strong><em>”I think I heard that Laurelblaze did that when she was an apprentice,”</em></strong></em> he mentioned, curiosity shimmering in his eyes.&#160; Icestar did pretty good at picking this match, didn’t she?&#160; She seemed like she usually knew who to give what apprentice.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; Take her onto a patrol?&#160; Excitement sprang up inside of the ash colored tom at the idea.&#160; He wasn’t exactly the most loving towards the dangers in the forest around which most of the Thunderclanners did their patrols, but his excitement partly came from this.&#160; Because he was too afraid to go very far into the forest alone he often found himself feeling useless inside of camp, sitting around when he felt he should be doing something more beneficial.&#160; He was getting better at gathering up with confidence for things such as solo hunts, but he had yet to fully get into the swing of things.&#160; This could be his opportunity to feel useful.&#160; Although, it was a little worrying that he would end up being the one expected to be the most mature on this patrol.&#160; <em><strong><em>”Sure, I’ve been wanting to do a patrol recently, anyways,”</em></strong></em> he said with a smile, happy to be able to fan the flames of excitement that burned in Tigerpaw’s eyes.</span>

<em>Laurelblaze did that too?</em> Her ears perked with interest and her rubies for eyes pooled with awe at the tom&#39;s remark. <strong>&quot;Really?&quot;</strong> breathed the young toyger. Her long claws curled into the sand and she quivered slightly with excitement. <em>Wait- no- of course she did...</em> Tigerpaw shook her head, after which a smile couldn&#39;t help spreading itself on her muzzle. <em>I&#39;m doing the right things. I&#39;m on the right track. Nice job, Tigerpaw!</em>

Feeling even more invigorated now to show herself off, the oaken molly pivoted quickly and trotted under the looming shade of the trees, leading the way towards the exit. <strong>&quot;Let&#39;s go! I can&#39;t wait.&quot;</strong> <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

Wrenkit gave a satisfactory nod when Coyotekit said that his bone stash had yet to be discovered. She was glad that he could still enjoy his collection. His issue with outgrowing the space troubled her, however. She was the type to make another cats problem her own, and would help any cat with anything, even if it didn’t affect her whatsoever. That trait could prove to be an issue for her in the future, but for the time being it didn’t seem to matter. She had helped him once before, and she would gladly do it again if he asked her to. <strong>”Thats no good,”</strong> she replied, frowning slightly. <strong>”It’s sort of strange though, isn’t it? How we don’t realize how much we’re growing until we can’t fit into certain places anymore.”</strong> She reflected. It was true. The young molly didn’t <em>feel</em> that much larger, but the nursery seemed to grow smaller every day, and even the warriors didn’t seem as large as they once had. The only thing she really noticed was how her legs had grown longer, and how her muscles had strengthened. She didn’t tire out as easily when she played now, and she no longer felt the need for her afternoon naps in the den. Things seemed to change slowly now, but soon everything would be different. 

She nodded, flashing the tom a grin. <strong>”Yep! I stalk bugs every day, they’re great practice! I want to be able to catch something on my very first hunt when I’m made an apprentice,”</strong> she explained. She knew that hunting successfully on an apprentices first day wasn’t that extraordinary, but it was still an accomplishment Wrenkit could be proud of. She didn’t have aspirations of being the greatest warrior in ThunderClan, but she did want to make herself and her clanmates proud. She wanted to be good. <strong>”I also do it for fun, of course. I get bored playing by myself sometimes and bugs are... interesting,”</strong> she concluded with a little shrug. 

For some reason, Wrenkit felt a small pang of sadness when Coyotekit said</span>

She’d hoped that they’d be sharing the apprentices den at the same time, but she supposed she could wait a moon for him. Wrenkit hoped that he would still be her friend, even when she was an apprentice and he wasn’t. Of course, it was silly to think that one moons age difference would have any affect on their friendship, but those were just the things that Wrenkit worried about. Her amber eyes rounded with sympathy. <strong>”I’m sure she will miss you being in the den with her, but I bet you’re going to make her very proud.”</strong> Wrenkit could imagine the leader would be very pleased to see her kits on their way to becoming strong warriors of the clan. She flicked Coyotekit gently with her tail tip, smiling softly. <strong>”You’re going to be great.”</strong></span>

The tabby warrior slightly shivered at the mention of the badger. They hoped that they wouldn&#39;t have to see it, as the long-haired warrior wanted to get away with their tail till on. <em>Alright, so just focus on the border. Not the badger.</em> The silver warrior looked around, almost expecting the badger to burst into the camp right there and then. They nodded, and padded after the Thunderclan deputy.</span>

Marigolddust couldn’t help but smile a the statement “she’s big”.&#160; Laurelblaze <em>was</em> the largest cat that he had ever met or seen, but he found it amusing that that was what Tigerpaw mentioned.&#160; He himself thought that her size was a little intimidating, considering the fact that she was twice his size in every aspect; size, courage, personality, skills, etc.&#160; It was pretty awesome that she was on the side of Thunderclan, though.&#160; There was no doubt that if she was on a side that he might oppose in the future he would give in the fight immediately.&#160; Who would want to fight her, anyways?&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; It was easy to see how excited Tigerpaw got when he mentioned that Laurelblaze had done what Tigerpaw does now.&#160; He hadn’t expected her to seem so surprised, especially since he would have thought that she would have already heard about it, since Laurelblaze was her mentor and all.&#160; He had never actually been told about how Skycloud felt about her own apprentichood or how she trained though… So what reason did Laurelblaze have to?&#160; Did the two practice the same way?&#160; Did everyone other than him practice on their own time?&#160; Fernpaw as always practicing, and he had no clue how the apprentices or warriors he knew dealt with apprentice hood.&#160; Perhaps he didn’t go through apprentice hood correctly.&#160; He never did think that he was any better at being a warrior than any other cat.&#160; Maybe he should try to fit in more hunting trips or patrols, even if he had to gather the confidence to do so first.&#160; He distracted himself by raising and grooming his paw briefly.&#160; He didn’t need to think about things like this, especially since he was going to go on a patrol now.&#160; This could be good practice, right?</span>

It was true, he wasn’t some bumbling kitten fattened from the milk he’d been sustained from. He wasn’t lethargic from overeating, napping only when he truly felt exhaustion. He began to actually start looking like a <em>cat</em>, he’d shed away his soft kitten fluff as if it were the down feathers of a baby chick. Plus, he’d long since noticed how he’d grown taller, that was rather obvious. He’d begun to tower over other kits around his age. <strong>”Yeah, I’m lucky I don’t have to worry about hitting my head on the tops of den entrances and stuff. The den in the Highledge is pretty big, at least for a few cats.”</strong> it was adequate for a leader and her family, it seemed, but to house multiple warriors? It wasn’t very practical for that purpose. One little aspect he should feel grateful for as the leader’s child.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His tail flickered as the she-kit gave her reasoning for spending her night hunting bugs. That was her motive? It was a pretty lofty goal for most apprentices, he’d heard most failed on their very first hunt. It was harder than they thought, and he didn’t believe that practicing on bugs was a very effective form of practice— but what did he know? He was just the kit who also happened to be a bone collector, he wasn’t exactly striving for greatness. Coyotekit preferred a quieter existence within the clan, being left to his own devices that did not cause anyone else harm. He’d leave the ambitious attitudes to his peers, it was too much excitement for him anyways. <strong>”Well, I hope it helps you on your first day. That is a pretty hard thing to achieve on your first hunt, or so I’ve heard.”</strong> his shoulders slumped in a small shrug, though he sounded genuine enough in his wishes for her good fortune— at least more so than usual. He did sound awfully formal for a kit, though he only did it mostly to be polite, unless someone did stir up his temper. If he was annoyed enough, he could be quite the little hot-head and get quite <em>sassy</em>. Luckily, Wrenkit hadn’t gotten on his bad side, he was quite creative with his rather <em>colorful</em> insults. Lots of time alone spent eavesdropping allowed him to expand his vocabulary. Not that he really used it much, he just had them in his arsenal, <em>just in case</em>

<strong>”Well, I’m sure she’ll also be happy she’ll have her den back for herself. Sharing it with seven kittens isn’t easy, I’m sure. I try to not get in her way that much, she already has a lot on her plate, being a leader and all.”</strong> truly, he did not understand the scale and depth of his mother’s work as the ThunderClan leader. There was so much he didn’t know that went on in that den, meetings, decisions that would forever affect the clan. He was blissfully unaware, yet he practically called it home.

Her white-mittened paws flexed against the quarry ground. It would be nice if they didn’t end up meeting with the badger again or any of its potential associates but Icestar wasn’t too worried if they did. Except maybe for Strikethroat and Marigolddust who both looked nervous at the mention of the black-and-white beast. <em>Laurelblaze and I can handle it then…</em> Her sore was almost as good as new. It shouldn’t give her any trouble if danger arose.

The lynx-point followed the leader of the patrol, Laurelblaze, through the thorn tunnel. The distinct smell of rain was evident in the air and the forest glistened with desperate raindrops that clung to the vegetation. It was a beautiful sight. Unfortunately, Icestar doubted they’d be able to catch something in this weather. Most of the prey would be comfortably burrowed in their cozy dens, waiting for the sun to burst through the thick clouds.

Dim light filtered into the apprentice den, the sun peppering kisses on each of the young cat’s pelts. The atmosphere was slightly humid and chilled from the previous night’s gentle rainfall. To Aspenpaw, it was almost as if the earth was letting out a long, cool, sigh of relief. Stretching her tired bones, the dull tabby molly dragged herself into a seated position, eyes lazily scanning her surroundings as she blinked the drowsiness from them. With a low sigh, she managed to haul herself out of the den, making sure to shove a certain brown cat awake as she departed. 

Outside of the den, the cool air worked it’s way through the tall apprentice’s fur, relieving her of the uncomfortable heat trapped in her pelt from sleeping near so many warm bodies. She groomed herself and stretched as she awaited Tigerpaw to exit the den too. They had come to a recent conclusion of sorts; they would help each other with their training, specifically the hunting portion. It was unorthodox, and certainly not a regular occurrence by any means, but Aspenpaw knew one thing: without the other molly, she was a terrible hunter. Of course, this meant she spent more hours training, but that was nothing to the she-cat. She didn’t have many friends to begin with. Well, she didn’t have any at all. Though, she supposed, now she had Tigerpaw. With that thought, her pupils narrowed. Now she had <em>Tigerpaw</em>. Suppressing a groan, the feline’s ears folded back. Her tangerine gaze focused onto the skyline with fatal intensity. She’d make this work. She had to.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tigerpaw was soundly asleep per usual, snoring the day away even as the first sheets of milky dawn light spilled through the trees and over the cliffs of camp. The apprentice den, a half burrow at the bottom of Icestar&#39;s ledge path, remained dark. Cozy as it was, it was never by her own volition that the young brown tabby found her way into consciousness.

Her jeweled head was lolling over the edge of her nest when Aspenpaw gave her a hard prod in the side, dampening the moss with drool and hot, sleepy breath. The dozing she-cat snorted sharply as though she might wake up, but instead rolled the other way without even a show of visionary pink.

Perhaps she rolled too far. Another unfortunate apprentice gave an irritable groan and shoved Tigerpaw&#39;s limp body off their turf. Tigerpaw whimpered drowsily and finally pushed herself upright on sore forearms, quivering shoulder muscles showing off developing tone beneath cocoa stripes as she stretched them. A mighty yawn skipped from her jaws and she smacked her lips as she finally peeled her gooey eyes open and panned the dim den.

Most of the nests were still laden with curled up bodies, flanks rising and falling steadily, but one silhouette waited just beyond the bushy entrance.

Tigerpaw grinned mildly with interest and weaved her way out to join the familiar lanky figure. She raked her body along the reinforcing thorns that arched the den entrance, arching her back with pleasure as she did so, and came to stand beside her newest friend.

<strong>&quot;Did Snowstorm leave already?&quot;</strong> she asked as she paralleled herself to her peer, surveying the still blueish camp. Laurelblaze was always busy in the mornings doling out patrols. The last group could be seen slipping out of sight into the territory while others nodded to the deputy and dispersed. <em>They look so important...</em> Tigerpaw thought with envy, gazing after them. <span class="mention" title="lynn#1873">@lynn</span></span>

The arrival of new-leaf was welcoming to say the least, finally banishing away the last of leaf-bare for the next few moons. The tom let out a sigh as he laid down, spreading out upon his side, the russet warrior let his gaze roam the camp in a lazy manner. Whiskers quivering slightly, the tom let out a yawn as the warm sunlight danced upon his pelt, green eyes glittering with a mischievous light before he let them close, more or less beginning to doze off.

Wrenkit replied with a simple shrug of her shoulders, a smile still adorning her features as usual. Even if she didn’t hunt successfully on her first day, she wouldn’t let it bring her down.  She’d never let something so small ruin her first day as an apprentice, and yet, she remained very hopeful still that she would be able to do it. And if not? That was okay, too. She was a fast learner, and was sure that she could use her mistakes to improve her skills rather quickly. She chuckled softly, batting at a small mosquito as it buzzed by the pair of kits. Easily distracted as ever. <strong>”Yeah, I suppose it is a pretty big goal. I won’t be upset if I don’t catch anything, but I’ll be so excited if I do.”</strong> She explained. <strong>”I’m just excited to bring food home for my clanmates. I always watch the warriors and apprentices come back with jaws full of prey, and it seems like a nice feeling,”</strong> she added, her smile widening a bit. 

She nodded at his next words, imagining what it would be like to have so many siblings. What a pawful that many kittens must be for one cat, and the leader nonetheless. <strong>”Being the leader of an entire clan sounds very... intimidating. Icestar is quite good at it, though.”</strong> Granted, the young kit wouldn’t know the first thing about being a leader, but from her perspective it <em>seemed</em> like Icestar did a great job. The clan was happy, healthy, and well fed. For Wrenkit, ThunderClan was the best place in the whole forest to be. Of course, she wouldn’t know any better even if it wasn’t. She wouldn’t know anything about the other clans until she was apprenticed, besides old nursery tales of course, which mostly revolved around ShadowClan and how evil they were. She tipped her head slightly to one side as her mind began to wander, and she once more found herself thinking about what apprenticeship would be like. <strong>”What are you looking forward to the most about becoming an apprentice?”</strong> She inquired.</span>

The russet tom’s ears twitched slightly, a sudden sense quickly washing over him. After a few moments, the warrior’s whiskers quivered. It was as if someone was nearby. Quite close, as a matter of fact. He could tell that it wasn’t merely a clanmate passing by, as the presence of another remained in the same spot. When he’d had enough, the tom’s eyes opened, falling upon the form of Tigerpaw, an apprentice. <strong>”Tigerpaw, don’t you know that it isn’t very kind to be so close to a resting clanmate? Surely, you have apprentice duties to tend to?”</strong> He questioned, yawning afterwards. Apprentices were peculiar felines at times, some were easier to deal with than others, but truly, all could be quite a pawful depending on the situation. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

Pale dawn light filtered through the trees, casting a light golden glow into the ThunderClan camp. As usual, Juniperpaw was one of the first to make an appearance out of the apprentices den. Always eager to be the first one hunting, the first one training. The silver tabby’s many ambitions included being an impeccable fighter, and that meant spending as much time as possible in the training hollow with his mentor and fellow apprentices. Nothing beat the feeling of perfecting a new battle move before any of the others, and as self absorbed as he could be, Juniperpaw loved the attention it earned him. Some might call it arrogance, but he preferred to call it confidence. He believed that there was nothing he couldn’t perfect with practice, and so far that had proven to be true. If any cat didn’t appreciate his occasional bragging, it wasn’t like they <em>had</em> to listen, right? 

Jaws parting in a yawn, the tom licked a large black paw and swiped it over his ears a few times before turning to smooth down some ruffled silver fur on his flank. Already, he was pleased with how his muscles had began to develop under his thick, long coat of silver and black. Each day he could feel himself getting stronger, getting closer to becoming the formidable warrior he so desired to be. He knew it was frowned upon, but he found himself <em>hoping</em> he got to be apart of battle soon. Of course he didn’t want the clans to fight, but he wanted the chance to show off his newly learned skills in a real battle scenario, with claws unsheathed. He’d show any other clan apprentices that ThunderClan was not a clan to be trifled with. As far as he was concerned, they had the strongest warriors in the forest, and he was on his way to becoming one of them.</span>

He had to pause to think on the question for a moment. Coyotekit didn’t tend to look too far into the future, and he had a habit of getting so engrossed in his current daily habits that he really did not have the time nor the energy to really devote any mental capacity towards such a subject. Needless to say, he didn’t exactly have a plan, nor really anything he looked forward to most. Sure, he was happy he’d be able to enjoy newfound freedoms, but that was what everyone else looked forward to. Usually everyone had one unique thing they wanted to do once they received their promotion... Right now, he really didn’t have a clue as to what he enjoyed most. In all honesty, he was slowly becoming a bit more disinterested in collecting bones at the moment. Mostly because others around him were discouraging him from doing so, but he also felt as if he’d exhausted the subject. When he was younger, he was hoping he’d have more places to hide them out in the woods, though now he was trying to think of ways he could branch out.

<strong>”I... I don’t know.”</strong> he murmured quietly, his ears pinning back against his skull for a brief moment. His neutral expression had turned to a more crestfallen one. He figured he’d just be focused on training, and avoiding doing anything that might incite his mother’s anger. He was a well-behaved kit, kept his nose clean aside from causing minor inconveniences whenever his bone collections were discovered. <strong>”I... I’ll likely just be doing what I need to do. I dunno what there is I really want to do. Maybe get to see the lake?”</strong> even he sounded half-hearted about that possibility, these were just from on the spot. He’d have to take time to truly plan out his future. Something he just now realized he’d neglected handling.

<em>Kits aren’t kits forever, you’re seeing it now, Coyotekit,</em> he’d stared down at his oversized paws for a moment, letting out a small sigh.</span>

The duller of the two flicked an ear at the other’s words. <strong>”I don’t know. Maybe? It doesn’t matter.”</strong> Aspenpaw huffed out, her gaze peering towards the camp entrance. Glancing towards the few cats in the clearing, the brown molly sucked in a sharp breath. <strong>”There’s an opening behind the den we can leave camp from. I don’t think we should just saunter out of camp in front of everyone.”</strong> Her intense gaze returned to Tigerpaw and she nodded curtly to the cheery she-cat before padding around the den and slipping between a small opening in the thicket that densely surrounded ThunderClan camp.

The apprentice’s slender form emerged on the other side of the bushes, pupils narrowing as she tried to recall where she was. Aspenpaw had been an apprentice for 3 moons already, so she knew the territory fairly well, but she had never left camp from this point before. After a moment of thinking the molly’s expression relaxed and she tossed her head back while she waited for her clan-mate.

The tom’s ears flicked, amber eyes narrowing just a tad. <strong>”Done with them? Well then, you should best be off enjoying your free time then.”</strong> He replied, before looking at the apprentice more closely. She seemed particularly distracted by something, but he could hardly guess what it was. Was there something going on? Was there someone nearby? Glancing about, he saw nothing of interest, everything was normal. Rubbing a paw over his eyes, the tom spoke once more. <strong>”Tigerpaw. Do tell me, what’s caught your attention in such a manner where you hardly seem focused?”</strong> Shuffling forward a bit, the tom waved a paw across the apprentice’s line of vision, whiskers quivering slightly.

It was an incredible day out. While it had been gloomy and raining in the past couple of days, today was a day of bright warmth as sunlight cascaded down in golden rays. <em>A perfect day for a ceremony,</em> Icestar mused to herself as she reached the top of the Highledge and planted herself firmly at the edge. Her Clanmates were busying themselves with daily tasks but they could use a break and a morale boost.

<strong>” All cats who are old enough to catch their own prey, gather around for a Clan meeting!”</strong> Icestar called out the usual words for signalling her warriors to cease their activities and join her for a few moments while they cheered on their newly ranked Clanmates. This ceremony was only going to be held for one but it didn’t matter. Irispaw deserved the attention. She was an apprentice worthy of stepping up as a warrior.

The elder apprentice&#39;s ears perked up when Icestar&#39;s voice rang out across camp. Stepping outside the den, she took in a deep breath of the fresh, morning air. <em>Guess its my ceremony today! Ooh.. how exciting... I hope mother is proud of me!</em> 

Her tail flicked with excitement as she took a seat, watching as the various other cats would begin to also gather.</span>

The sunny, cloudless sky was a great backdrop for today’s ceremonies in her mind. A good omen for what was in store for these young cats getting promoted, though she’d heard whispers on the wind that it was only one apprentice being promoted to a warrior. Nonetheless, it was a time for celebration, even one more warrior being added to their ranks was a worthy time for a joyous ceremony. The ThunderClan deputy sat herself down in her usual spot in the clearing, joining the rest of the crowd in their merriment as she watched Icestar from below the Highledge. Her ears flickered as she dipped her head to any of her clanmates who’d happened to be sitting nearby, curling her bushy tail around her paws as she prepared for the ceremony to go underway.</span>

The older tom dropped a fresh kill into the pile before slowly turning toward Icestar and clearing his throat casually. He entered the crowd and sat amongst his peers calmly; his on brand stoic expression plastered across his scarred face.</span>

Pulling herself up from her slumber, Hazybrook blinked away the tiredness from her two toned gaze as she padded out of the warrior’s den, an ear coasting to the side. What kind of meeting would this be, she wondered. A ceremony? Announcements?

And that’s when Irispaw sprung to mind. Slowly, carefully, a smile grew upon her features. She knew her daughter was growing to be warrior age, so maybe that’s what this meeting was called for. She had decided to sit a ways away from the rest of the congregated cats, her tail curled around her paws.

Fiery eyes twinkled in their sea-green flames as Icestar studied the Clanmates that gathered in considerable numbers. It was a good thing too! She glanced over to Irispaw, a bubble of happiness bursting in her chest. The apprentice has gone a long way, just like any other. They had successfully overcome their challenges and now were ready to receive their warrior name and face many more obstacles. 

<strong>” I, Icestar of ThunderClan, call upon my warrior ancestors to look down on this apprentice,”</strong> the lynx-point began, meeting Irispaw’s eyes. <strong>” They have trained hard to understand the ways of your noble code, and I commend them to you as a warrior in their turn. Irispaw,”</strong> she paused, drawing attention to the senior apprentice. <strong>” Do you promise to uphold the warrior code and to protect and defend your Clan, even at the cost of your life?”</strong>

The tricoloured femme&#39;s heart leapt when the leader&#39;s gaze met hers, and she knew it was time. After being unknowingly give a second chance at life, and overcoming her own internal struggles, she was finally ready.

Rising up on all four paws, she nodded. <strong>&quot;I do.&quot;</strong>

Sparrowfeather stepped out from the warriors den, she had barely made a nest for herself about a few nights ago- and a clan meeting was already being called again, her tail struck up in the air as she made her way over to the high ledge. Was this another ceremony? She looked around seeing Irispaw- she seemed excited- beaming even. She sat down and heard Icestar start to give out the words she had heard during her ceremony- very similar actually. She hadn’t ever really met Irispaw as an apprentice but it would be cool to have a new warrior- so Sparrowfeather  wouldn’t look so much like a newbie.</span>

<strong>“Then by the powers of StarClan,”</strong> Icestar continued, raising her voice. As she raised her ocean-coloured gaze, a lone purple petal swirled in the air in front of her. <em>Odd…</em> Usually, the full flower would be caught in the wind, not parts of it. Before she could observe it further, the breeze carried it on into the horizon, out of sight of her studious look. The silvery-white leader paused for a moment, considering what she had just seen. 

Clearing her throat, the ThunderClan leader proceeded to look up at the vast expanse of the blue sky. There was not a cloud in sight. <strong>” I give you your warrior name. Irispaw, from this moment on, you will be known as Irispetal.”</strong> That was the flower that the purple petal had belonged to. <strong>” StarClan honours your kindness and bravery, and we welcome you as a full warrior of ThunderClan.”</strong> She twisted her head to the right, leaning forward to rest her muzzle upon Irispetal’s head.

<em>Irispetal..</em>
She liked it! A purr rose in her throat as the leader&#39;s muzzle touched her head, her bubbly, contagious smile never fading. Glancing away for a moment, she searched for her mother&#39;s familiar pelt, and once she spotted her, her grin widened. 

<em>Look, mother! I made it!</em>

As she turned her attention back to her ceremony, she happily prepared herself for the oncoming cheers, but not before a shiver ran down her spine, as if someone was right beside her. But, there was nobody in sight. Just a coincidence, right? It must be. So, she shrugged it off.</span>

The burly tortoiseshell had continued to watch the ceremony with keen interest, spotting the cat of the hour who was to receive her warrior name. She&#39;d listened in carefully, a small smile adorning her battle-scarred features as the new warrior was dubbed with her new name, <em>Irispetal</em>. Laurelblaze cleared her throat before she began to join in with the chanting, as was the custom for these events. A cry of celebration, they were to chant this new warrior&#39;s name aloud: <strong>&quot;Irispetal! Irispetal! Irispetal!&quot;</strong> she made sure to yowl out the new name at the top of her lungs, to give this new warrior the celebration she deserved. This was to be a happy memory for her, as it was for everyone else who received their warrior name.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As Tigerpaw padded slowly from the blue shadows still swathing the ThunderClan camp like thick cobwebs, her jaws parted in a massive yawn. She walked near blindly back towards the apprentice den, where she wish she could have stayed, but had been unable to stave off a trip of the dirtplace any longer that morning. Even the sleepiest apprentice couldn&#39;t resist nature&#39;s call.

Usually she slept in until Aspenpaw dragged her out. Laurelblaze was busy sorting patrols for the better part of dawn. As golden light hit her brown fur, turning it a rich chocolate color, she was able to take some pleasure in the wee hours, but the new sun was still weak and offered little more than a hint of warmth to the zombie cat.

Happening to look up just to be sure she wouldn&#39;t trip on anything, her eyes caught on a sturdy young tom - Juniperpaw, if her currently half functioning brain recalled correctly. Standing there with his muscles perfectly illuminated, Tigerpaw wasn&#39;t sure what to make of his potentially flashy attitude, but she did know that she wouldn&#39;t be outdone.

The smaller she-cat braced herself as she drew closer to passing, flexing as much of herself as she could to try and match his presentation, despite the painfully obvious bags under her eyes. Her strength wasn&#39;t as impressive as his, but the tone was definitely there, a sign of a trainee who didn&#39;t slack despite her unorthodox sleeping habits. She thought she looked nonchalant, but the whole show was truly... silly. <span class="mention" title="tremb#3692">@tremb</span></span>

From his placement outside of the apprentices den, Juniperpaw took notice of the she-cat before she even realized he was there. He recognized her instantly, of course. He had seen her training before, and could tell that she was going to be quite the warrior one day. Just like him. He thought someone with her ambitions could make a great friend for himself. <strong>”Hey, Tigerpaw,”</strong> he meowed silkily, a wide grin playing on his features. 

He tapped the ground beside him with his fluffy silver tail, inviting her to join him. <strong>”Long day training yesterday? You look tired,”</strong> he commented with a soft chuckle. Of course, he meant no offense by that. He respected the apprentices that trained hard like he did, and didn’t bother to complain about being tired. Besides, it was all worth it in the end. The exhaustion, the sore muscles, the constant busyness with so little time for relaxation. Juniperpaw was savoring every moment of it, personally. He didn’t miss being a kit at all. The camp had always been far too boring for him, and when he was a kit no cat paid him much attention no matter what he did. Now that he was an apprentice, he could show off his skills and cats actually cared about them, and praised them. It was a nice change. 

<strong>”I could fetch us a nice juicy mouse off the pile to share, if you like. I’m sure we can hunt later and bring plenty of prey back to replace it, anyways.”</strong> The silver and black tom said. Although his biggest focus was fighting, he made sure to focus on his hunting skills as well. Hunting was every bit as important as battle skills, even though battle training brought the tom more fun.</span>

Wrenkit immediately noticed the look on Coyotekit’s face in response to her questions, and her own ears flattened to her skull. She realized that she’d said the wrong thing, though she didn’t think until now that it would have upset the other kit. Maybe he didn’t want to think about the future? Perhaps becoming an apprentice really didn’t excite him as much as it did most kittens. That was understandable, she supposed. Growing up could be kind of scary. Being a kitten was easy. No one expected anything from you, there was no real responsibilities or troubles to weigh on your shoulders. Being an apprentice could be quite overwhelming, so maybe that had caused Coyotekit’s attitude to change? Wrenkit bit her lip, staring down at her paws as she thought about what to say next. She hated to see any cat upset, even if it was only slightly, and her first instinct was to cheer him up somehow. He had mentioned the lake, perhaps she could go off of that. 

<strong>”Seeing the lake will be amazing! Everyone says it’s so big, that they’ve never seen anything like it.”</strong> She said, grinning widely. In all truthfulness, there was a lot that Wrenkit was excited about. Perhaps she could get Coyotekit feeling a bit more positive as well. <strong>”I’m excited to see the lake, too. And the whole of ThunderClan territory. It’s so much more than just this camp, it’s a whole new world out there to see. I’m excited to attend my first gathering and see what the other clans are like outside of the nursery tales we’ve been told. I’m excited to learn new things too, like how to hunt and fight.”</strong> She took a pause, smiling warmly as her amber gaze swept the camp. <strong>”I’m even excited to take care of the elders, even though I hear all the apprentices complain about it a lot,”</strong> she said with a small giggle. She knew most kits didn’t get excited about having to tend to the elders, but she liked the idea of contributing to her clan in every way.</span>

Soft sunlight illuminated against the old tom&#39;s black coat as he stepped outside from the elders den, turning his dark pelt into a dim grey as he kept his grey eyes clouded from the morning light with his furrowed brows. Batears took a few rushed pawsteps forward to the fresh-kill pile, he hated the slow and weak pace that came with his old age, wishing that his youthful strength somehow came back one day and have the ability to run around without anycat slowing him down and scolding him for being such a reckless elder. 

Screw young people who actually care about his vulnerable health, he&#39;s gonna die anyway soon! But then he won&#39;t be able to spread rumors and gossip in Thunderclan... Oh wait, he can do that in Starclan too! Almost forgot. 

A flick gave out of his large ears, he leaned down with a small grunt as he tried to reach over for a vole— already feeling his frail bones shattering apart, especially in his legs. Batears dropped himself onto his side, breathing out a small sigh from his narrow muzzle before greeting his meal with sharp teeth digging into it&#39;s deceased carcass. The tom&#39;s grey eyes shifted towards every inch and corner of Thunderclans camp, hues turning into slits to anycat who looked at him weirdly— or just looked at him the way he didn&#39;t exactly please with whatsoever.

Perhaps she was right, this would lead to new opportunities for them both. They could each explore the territory on their own at last and get to know the world around them. It was supposed to be exciting, though he figured he’d likely just be doing his own thing for the most part. Maybe that wasn’t exactly a bad thing, not everyone had concrete plans for their future. Besides, he wasn’t looking to strive for ambitious plans. He just wanted to live a calm existence, he’d sort out what he wanted from life later on. For now, he was going to enjoy whatever free-time he had left before it’d be taken up by training, patrols, or any other duties. <em>I’m not gonna get in trouble a lot, I don’t want to clean the elders’ nests all the time.</em> the thought was horrifying, even if there was a grand total of two elders within ThunderClan’s walls. One trait he seemed to share with most of the kits his age.</span>

He always cycled them out and was respectful towards them, he wasn’t hoarding every single bone he found anyways, usually just the interesting ones. <strong>”Plus, I can get away from the crowds, I’m not really a fan of all the loud chatter.

Wrenkit was good in his books, he just did not like crowds. <strong>”Uh, but the territory... yeah.”</strong> he awkwardly shuffled his paws as he glanced towards the Highledge, clenching his teeth as he was preparing an escape from his social blunders. He could be quite blunt with how he phrased things, often he forgot there were others around.

Her back lengthened as Icestar stretched her lithe body in a light arc. Her spine gave out a pleasant crackle, loosening up the tension that had built up there. The lynx-point’s muscles rippled as they strained to keep her whole self balanced. <em>Boy, does a good stretch feel so good!</em> Icestar thought with a quiet purr rumbling in her throat. <em>Now all I need is a good hunt outside to warm myself up and get started for the day!</em>

Passing by the fresh-kill pile, the ThunderClan leader’s gaze caught on the only elder currently residing in her Clan: Batears. Her white-mittened paws rooted themselves in place as she observed the frail feline struggle to grab a vole and settle back down to consume his meal. The young feline watched, wondering if she would ever be able to bear becoming that weak if she ever lived long enough.

For awhile... Nocat seemed to have been glaring at him as usual, which he found calming and rather— refreshing to see; Both him being peaceful and other cats not petruding in his business with their weirded and scared gazes. 

But he was wrong, oh so wrong. His grey gaze lurked around the camps edges curiously, until the dim eyes of Batears fooled him and locked within Icestars hues. 

The elders eyes narrowed down in a judgmental glare, he had all the senses and clues to know that the lynx-point she-cat is the cat that takes authority over everycat in Thunderclan; Where he and his old bones resided in.

But did he care? No, Batears couldn&#39;t give a darn if his glare and upcoming voice of tone offended the siamese commander. He didn&#39;t obey Laurelblazes orders to retrieve back to camp once she told him to a few moons ago, so why should he care if Icestar took harshness to Batear&#39;s attitude? Besides, he was just a scrawny elder who had a desire to gossip about everycat he found to be on his bad side.

Amber eyes brightened and a grin flashed upon her lips at his response, glad to hear him talk about some things he was looking forward to. She waved her tail to and fro through the air as she spoke. <strong>”Yes! I’m sure there will be plenty of nooks and crannies in the forest to store your collection. You’ll never have to worry about them being taken again,”</strong> she went on cheerfully. She had no idea yet, but she was sure that ThunderClan’s forest was quite large and full of places for new apprentices to explore. There were bound to be great hiding spots, too. Who knew, maybe Coyotekit would find some cool undiscovered locations in the territory that even the warriors didn’t know about in his search for hiding places.

She tipped her head as he continued to speak about escaping the bustle of the camp and cats, feeling momentarily worried that she might be crowding him. Of course, that worry went away quickly when he reassured her that she wasn’t a bother. For that, she was glad. Wrenkit was much more social than Coyotekit, that was for certain, but even she valued her alone time. She knew that several cats could be quite overwhelming, and it was good to have time and space to think and have a clear head. <strong>”I’m glad I’m not bothering you,”</strong> she responded softly. <strong>”But, if I ever do, you can totally tell me. I’ll understand,”</strong> she added with a sweet smile. She would absolutely rather have him tell her he didn’t feel like socializing than not say anything and end up being annoyed by her. She had been called annoying in the past, so Wrenkit always carried the anxiety that she might be bothering any cat she spoke to. 

Though there were plenty of things that the young she-kit was excited</span>

As the full moon made it’s ascent into the ink-colored night sky, it signaled for yet another Gathering to take place for the clans. Being tasked with leading the clan to the island and representing ThunderClan for tonight, the deputy stepped out into the clearing and began to rally her clanmates. <strong>”Let all cats old enough to hunt and catch their own prey accompany me to the island!”</strong> as soon as she was finished speaking, the large tortoiseshell began to make her exit from camp with any of her clanmates who decided to join her in tow. Hopefully this would be quick, nothing getting in their way.

At the sound of Laurelblaze&#39;s call and the stating of the word &quot;gathering&quot; Marigolddust was in camp.  He was only given a moment to look up and enjoy the stars above him before he convinced himself that he should follow Laurelblaze and the others to the gathering.  He felt more comfortable with he idea of going to the Gathering now, and no longer needed chamomile to calm himself down... Not normally, at least.  And the river wasn&#39;t going to kill him, right?  He had crossed it by himself a few times recently, and he was a grown warrior.  He shouldn&#39;t fear such a thing.

As they were rapidly approaching the onset of greenleaf, the sunlight was only going to get harsher. At least, that would be a rational thought belonging to any cat living amongst the clans. For Laurelblaze, it meant suffocating in her fur for the most part. While having a thick, protective coat of dense, russet toned fur had it’s advantages, resistance against the heat was not one of them. The deputy often suffered in the boiling months, luckily they were still not upon their doorstep, still, she loathed the thought of having to put up with them.

She’d been occupying herself with inspecting dens and planning out future patrols while she awaited results from the morning hunting patrols she’d sent out earlier, deciding to not accompany them for today. She hadn’t taken the time to inspect the dens for damage or natural wear and tear, nor had she maintained them as of late. <em>Slacking...</em> even if it wasn’t necessarily true, even if she was supposed to keep up with her clan’s affairs as their deputy, she was still only one cat. All the work couldn’t be left to her to make up. She deserved breaks too. Heaving a sigh, she’d decided to take a seat nearby one of her clanmates, who appeared to be in the middle of a meal at the moment. <strong>”Oh, hey Speckleflame.”</strong> she greeted the tom with a flicker of her bushy tail, <strong>”How’s your finch?”</strong>

As much as she’d appreciated the kind gesture from her clanmate in offering a portion of his meal to her, she had to decline. Gently shaking her head, she chuckled awkwardly. <strong>”Thank you, but I already ate this morning and it’d be unfair to the others. I still need to get out there and handle some more duties before the day ends.”</strong> her ears flickered a bit as she gazed back down to the tom from where she sat, letting out a small sigh as she relaxed into her sitting position. Might as well stick around and continue to strike up an interesting conversation while she was here and could afford to make the time for it. <strong>”I gotta pull my own weight around here like everyone else. Can’t have special privileges just because I’m the deputy, gotta be fair about it.”</strong> she scratched her chin lazily, her lips curling up into an amused smirk. She held herself to high standards on her own, so she wasn’t going to shirk her duties or give herself any advantages over the others.

Right now, the deputy was mostly taking a brief repose in camp, enjoying the scenery that came with new-leaf. The aroma of wildflowers was on the wind, and she wanted to take this moment to truly unwind for even just a moment. <strong>”Not at this moment, perhaps later on, though I’m grateful for the offer.”</strong> she shook her head a bit, she’d be scheduling more patrols, likely remarking the northern border as it hadn’t been done in a few days. Might as well check for any activity by there and whether anything was amiss. For now, they could ease up on the workload and actually take their time and bask in the sun. <strong>”I’ll be on a patrol later on though, you’re welcome to join it.”</strong>

Well, he didn’t seem too keen on talking. A rare trait amongst her clanmates, they were a rather chatty bunch— at least compared to some of the members of the other clans she’d met. Maybe she could get a few words out of him, just so she could keep the conversation going and actually get to know him a bit. She always liked understanding her comrades a bit better. <strong>”Well, are you looking forward to greenleaf? We’re definitely gonna have a busy season, I’m hoping for some thunderstorms. I love seeing the sky flash with each strike and the crack and roar of the thunder, it’s thrilling!”</strong> her eyes lit up at the prospect. Despite very much being <em>outside</em> for the entirety of her life, she still liked the idea of danger a good storm brought with it. Always the adrenaline addict she was, a quick thrill was always a way to get her riled up and excitable. Besides, they provided a nice, cool break from the typical heatwaves of greenleaf.

She met Batears defending glare with a unfazed look . That didn’t last long for the elder soon quipped sharply at ThunderClan’s leader. Icestar’s stream of thoughts became jaggedly broken. Her white chin was jerked into the air automatically, a quick assertion of her dominance. The flash in her ocean-coloured optics spoke of surprise at the outspoken tom. It soon hardened into a stare of fiery infernos.

<strong>” I’m staring at you,”</strong> the lynx-point replied honestly. She wasn’t going to deny that. <strong>” I got lost in thought.”</strong> Her mind had been darting past many subjects as of late. Fallen Claws. Echostar. Badgers. The safety of her Clan. Silentwing…<em>Speaking of which, had Eaglewing managed to infiltrate the Dark Forest?</em> She cast a quick glance towards the warrior’s den, doubting her stoic friend would be snoozing away at this hour.

It seemed she wasn’t the only fan of loud, crashing storms around here! Some cats didn’t like the loud, sudden noises, especially if they were prone to being startled by such sounds. She couldn’t blame them, though she really did like the noise. Reminded her of camp when it was in a stir, like in a ceremony. She always liked having noise around, especially a commotion, usually for good things of course. There was a difference between the yowls and screeches that came from battle than the yowls and cries of joy from a ceremony. Even if she enjoyed a little danger now and again. <strong>”I’m definitely going to be putting my apprentices to work, I have to make sure that Bouncepaw and Tigerpaw are gonna be powerful warriors at the end of it all. They’re relying on me as their mentor.”</strong> taking on two apprentices at once was always hard work, but she enjoyed the challenge. It was a privilege to teach the youth of her clan in the ways of a warrior. Getting to know them, she saw them as an extension of her family practically. She had to protect them like she would her own kits, and to make sure they were ready to face the world. Of course she was dedicated and grew attached to them, but even she knew they would have to move on with their lives eventually, but she wanted to make sure they always had a place to go even after their apprenticeship ended. She wanted them to trust her no matter what happened from the moment they traded their apprentice -paw title for a bonafide warrior name. <strong>”Do you have any apprentices? Or have you trained anyone yet?”</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Juniperpaw&#39;s voice was impossibly smooth for so early in the morning - even the songbirds had competition. Tigerpaw stopped. <strong>&quot;Hi Juni<em>pErp</em>-&quot;</strong> she squeaked, her voice cracking after a night of snoring disuse. She quickly shook her head and tried again. <strong>&quot;Hey Juniperpaw.&quot;</strong>

Her claws curled in and out of the sand a couple times in uneasy curiosity before following his gesture and padding to join him, keeping her brindled flank just comfortably enough away from his protruding fluff.

The she-cat was busy rubbing her eyes clear of crust while he made his small talk. <strong>&quot;Huh? Uh, yeah,&quot;</strong> she answered, surfacing clumsily from her distraction. <strong>&quot;I mean no-ahhhw..!&quot;</strong> The denial trailed into a refuting yawn. So much for looking alive.

Determined to shake her drowsiness, Tigerpaw tugged her raspberry eyes wide open, willing them to look bright and alert despite the screen of sleep that still hung like a cloud in their facets. She found that the cold camp floor against her rump was shocking her further into consciousness, and after another survey of the camp her gaze circled back to him, just in time to sport and expression of stark opposition.

<strong>&quot;No way dude!&quot;</strong> she objected in a squeal, quickly slapping a chocolate mitt over her mouth when she realized she&#39;d be disturbing their still dozing clanmates. Tigerpaw dropped her voice to a hiss, leaning close to him, or more so under his chin, her eyes shining with great purpose. Jaggedfire wouldn&#39;t be so lenient on her again she guessed, and if Laurelblaze found out she&#39;d been setting a bad example again, she&#39;d have her head for it. Tigerpaw shuddered inwardly at the thought.

Clearly she wanted to say more, searching for a way to explain herself casually, but instead all she said as her mew came back out of a whisper was, <strong>&quot;I&#39;m, like, not even hungry anyway.&quot;</strong> She sat back up and licked her chest, trying again to look dignified. A moment later her belly growled and she curled in on it vainly.</span>

In truth, he didn’t find her annoying. She was good company and never poked fun at or ridiculed him for his hobbies. She was just more outspoken than he was, though it seemed she was getting him to speak up a bit more, at least around her. Perhaps it was just because they were friends, normally he’d just give quick answers rather than actually thinking over what he was saying. He ended up being quite blunt and came off as a bit rude or curt, even if it was not his intention. He was also incredibly formal in his word choice for a kit, but that was just him. He liked sounding mature for his age, someone had to be out of his litter. Even if he had morbid fascinations with bones, though it was purely for the sake of his own intellectual curiosity. Nothing more.

<strong>”My mentor? No, I’m not worried.”</strong> he shook his head and answered that question rather confidently. He trusted that his mother would give him a good mentor along with the rest of his siblings when the time came. She was a smart and dedicated leader to her clan, and surely that extended to her kits. He trusted that she would give every kit of the clan a reliable and trustworthy mentor. That would include Wrenkit, of course. <strong>”I’m sure my mom will appoint someone good for you, I can tell her that you’re a bit worried about it, if it’s bugging you so much. You’ve helped me with hiding my collections a bunch, so I figure I could return the favor in a way... For your peace of mind, I guess?”</strong> paying it forward, he figured, if he got the chance to speak with his mother on the matter. She was awfully busy a lot, but surely she had time for one quick conversation. Only if Wrenkit approved of the idea, however, he wouldn’t take any action if she declined the offer.

<strong>&quot;<em>Bah!</em>&quot;</strong> a shrill, throaty yelp of surprise burst from the apprentice as she jumped and spun to meet the source of a sudden voice. What she found was a pair of arresting violet eyes, a sleek tortoiseshell pelt, and a judgmentally pursed mouth. Thick as her skull was, though, even Tigerpaw could see the hint of curiosity mixed in with her clanmate&#39;s freezing eyes.

<em>How did I not smell you?</em> The question played clear as day in her own coral facets. Instead of chasing the answer though, Tigerpaw skipped straight ahead to trying to play off her bad behavior. <strong>&quot;I was- um-&quot;</strong> Her brown tabby pelt bristled and her eyes glittered as she fumbled wildly for an explanation. <strong>&quot;I was getting moss for Icestar&#39;s nest-&quot;</strong> One look at her empty paws and she regretted the lie instantly. <strong>&quot;Wait, no, I mean-&quot;</strong> Exasperation began to boil inside her like magma. <em>Think, idiot, think!..</em> <span class="mention" title="northern foxy#8613">@spark&#39;s clone™</span>                    </span>

The resurfacing of Icestar&#39;s name made Tigerpaw freeze. The cocoa tabby&#39;s veins turned to ice.

The white-and-ginger tabby laid at the edge of camp, staring quietly at her paws. It had been moons since Frecklewish had been found slain by a fox. Coupled that with the pain of Onionslice&#39;s exile, Patchheart couldn&#39;t help but feel distanced from her clanmates. She normally hunted alone, avoiding interactions with others as she tried poorly to process her grief. She felt so alone. 
Her orange eyes gazed sadly across the camp as she let out a sigh, knowing she would have to go hunt again soon to keep her clanmates from assuming she was being lazy.</span>

The past few days had been rather turbulent in terms of weather. As greenleaf was right on the horizon, there were major shifts in how it was impacting the clans. Some days it was sunny, warm, as the rays of the white star above illuminated their days. The next, the skies were gray and cloudy, with occasional rainfall that dampened the soil beneath their paws and nourished the plant life that littered their territory. On some occasions, even on the clearest of days, violent, tumultuous storms raged across the skies and darkened them in their path. They rumbled and roared with thunder, with the occasional white flash of a lightning strike nearby. Yet, as quick as they were to make their entrance, they were quick to retreat, wreaking havoc elsewhere. Greenleaf was always a busy time, not just for the forest creatures as well at the clan cats.

Still, it always brought it’s own set of challenges unique to the season. They couldn’t slack on collecting prey for their storage just because it was so abundant. They would need to reap the rewards before it began to dwindle as they approached leaf-fall. She had to keep track of it and make sure she was sending out enough patrols to account for it all. ThunderClan would be strong as they entered leaf-bare, she had to make sure of that. There was no time of year where she could sit back and take a break, she had to uphold her duties, and she hoped that she was setting a good example for many of the younger members of their clan.

The large tabby tom&#39;s mouth opened wide in a yawn, as he crouched in a puddle of weak sunshine at the corners of camp. He&#39;d spent the morning patrolling and hunting, doing his best to provide for his clan, but with no apprentice and no assigned duties or chores he was getting a little bored. Hawkswoop was still tired from patrolling earlier but perhaps a walk through the forest with another cat would wake him up a little and they might even be able to catch some prey to bring back.

Heaving himself to his paws, Hawkswoop stretched for a moment before gathering his paws under him and standing up to his full height. He shook his fur gently to get rid of the dust and shreds of leaves it&#39;d accumulated as he&#39;d rested in camp, and scanned the clearing for someone to take with him.

His attention was brought to a ginger and white she-cat laying quietly at the edge of camp. Patchheart was her name, if he remembered correctly. A melancholic air hung around her - her orange eyes were glazed, as if she was distracted or sad, and she seemed to be distancing herself from her clanmates.

Hawkswoop padded over to her, moving slowly and making sure to make his pawsteps audible to avoid accidentally catching her off guard and frightening her. He slowed to a halt a few paces in front of the she-cat, ducking his head and offering a warm smile.

<strong>&quot;Patchheart, right? I&#39;m Hawkswoop,&quot;</strong> he introduced himself.</span>

The young shecat watched as a fellow warrior made his way slowly across the camp, dread filling her gut. She silently prayed he was going to pass her by and enter one of the nearby dens, but as his paws led him closer towards her, she realized she&#39;d have to make small talk.

As he bowed his head and introduced himself, she gave a small nod before replying, her voice slightly hoarse from lack of use.
<strong>&quot;Yeah, thats me...&quot;</strong> she mewed. <strong>&quot;Nice to meet you, Hawkswoop.&quot;</strong> she offered half heartedly in response, before shuffling her paws slightly in nervousness.   <strong>&quot;Did...uh...you need something?&quot;</strong> she asked quietly, raising a brow.</span>

He hesitated slightly, unsure if he should push her to come with him. It&#39;d probably be good for the she-cat to have some company but he didn&#39;t want to drag her along or make her uncomfortable or disturb her.

<strong>&quot;I was wondering if you wanted to take a walk with me - maybe check the borders or go hunting a little,&quot;</strong> he offered, ducking his head a little to her eye level. He made sure to keep his movements slow and predictable, his tone gentle and quiet - the last thing poor Patchheart needed right now would be someone ordering her around or being harsh.

<strong>&quot;No pressure, of course. If you don&#39;t want to come, or if you wanna come or not talk, or anything, really - then that&#39;s alright,&quot;</strong> he added.</span>

A smirk laced the toms lips at Tigerpaw’s cracking voice, though he said nothing. He understood her tiredness, even if she didn’t want to admit just how tired she really was. He had experienced it plenty of times. Though he seemed a ball of energy this particular morning, it was partially a credit to the fact that he had been up quite a bit longer than her.  He had already managed to ward off his sleepiness, and she surely would soon as well. 

Juniperpaw chuckled softly, rolling his pale blue optics as the she-cats jaws parted in a yawn. <strong>”I’m sure we can find a way to wake you up,”</strong> he said cheekily, giving her a soft nudge with a black forepaw. Now would be a great time to be a warrior. They could have gone for a hunt, or a walk through the forest to warm up their muscles. What a shame they couldn’t go out without an escort, unless they snuck out, of course. 

Judging by her response to his breakfast suggestion, he guessed she wouldn’t be up for that. <strong>”Alright, alright, keep your fur on,”</strong> he teased. <strong>”I wouldn’t dare get you in trouble,”</strong> he added sincerely. He scoffed lightly as her stomach rumbled in protest to her refusal of food. <strong>”Ah, right. Me either,”</strong> Juniperpaw responded with a wink. <strong>”So, no breakfast then. And I can only assume you don’t want to sneak out of camp with me, so… what do you propose we do? I’m bored,”</strong> he said with a mischievous grin.</span>

<em>He wants to hunt...with me?</em> the thoughts raced through her mind as she contemplated his words. Her orange gaze was unsure at first, but as he spoke, she couldnt help but feel a little relief that he was making it her choice to go or not. 

She let out a brief sigh after considering her options, befote slowly rising to her paws. <strong>&quot;Its probably good for me to stretch my legs anyway.&quot;</strong> she shrugged with a low voice, forcing a small smirk at him. <strong>&quot;Sure, ill join you...i cant promise ill be the best company, but..it would be nice to walk with someone i suppose.&quot;</strong> she mewed. Her mind screamed at her to stay put, to not bother moving and continue isolating herself. But her heart knew she&#39;d never get better if she didnt at least <em>try</em> to push forward, as much as it hurt.</span>

He blinked warmly, clearly happy about her reaction and agreement to join him. He stretched again as she stood, trying to shake the weariness from his paws. Tail flicking behind him, plucking at the ground with his claws - he wanted to make sure he was alert and ready for anything, just in case they ran into trouble.

Checking to make sure the she-cat was following him, he made his way to the camp exit, muttering apologies to any cat he accidentally bumped into or had to step around - it seemed as if, in newleaf, every cat was eager to get things done and everyone felt constantly busy, and so at this time of the day the camp was usually bustling.

<strong>&quot;I was thinking maybe we could go around the Windclan border,</strong>&quot; he offered as he ducked through the camp exit, wincing a little as it scraped his ears. <strong>&quot;We could check on it, and hey, while we&#39;re there we might even come across a stray rabbit or two on our side. Been a while since I chased after one.&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tigerpaw could ignore her stomach for the sake of rules any day, but her boredom?.. Not so much. Upon his musing her raspberry eyes darted sidelong at the camp entrance, which sat high on the cliff, open and tempting... Could they..? She shook her head.

But the thoughts didn&#39;t cease. It wasn&#39;t like this was the first time she&#39;d been out in the territory alone, or with other apprentices for that matter. She had recently been reaping the perks of being an older apprentice. The warriors trusted her more, even if she didn&#39;t always make the best decisions. Tigerpaw could handle herself.

The usual confidence she aired wasn&#39;t so obvious in this moment though. <strong>&quot;Do you think...&quot;</strong> she began quietly, still eyeing the tunnel. <strong>&quot;They wouldn&#39;t notice, would they?&quot;</strong> Laurelblaze would be busy until after dawn and Aspenpaw had been promised a one on one session.

<span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> 

<strong>”Hmm,”</strong> was the only response than Wrenkit could manage at first. He seemed so unbothered by the thought of his future mentor. Perhaps she was overthinking it? Wrenkit was an over thinker, even at her young age, and she was beginning to realize that not all cats analyzed everything the way that she did. Things that worried her seemed to be the least of anyone else’s concerns, and it made her think that perhaps she shouldn’t fret so much. She didn’t mean to, of course. It was just the way she was. She found herself constantly analyzing the tones in which other cats spoke to her, and often made assumptions about how they felt about her if they were anything less than cheerful. She hated it, of course, that she could barely get through a conversation without feeling as though she was annoying her counterpart. Coyotekit seemed to have great confidence when it came to the topic of his future mentor, and Wrenkit wanted that as well. After all, it was pointless to worry. In no more than a moon, she’d be appointed a mentor and that would be that. She should be excited, not worried! At his next words, her amber hues brightened immensely. <strong>”You’d really do that for me?”</strong> She asked. Her mind immediately went to Marigolddust as her obvious choice, had it been here to make. 

She couldn’t just come out and ask for him to be her mentor though. What if he didn’t want to be her mentor? When she had suggested it to him, the idea seemed to scare him. She still couldn’t tell if he didn’t like the idea of mentoring her in particular, or mentoring any cat in general. He seemed to overthink just as much as she did, which was one thing Wrenkit liked about him. <strong>”I guess I just worry that my mentor won’t be patient enough with me,”</strong> she said with a shrug. She was determined and good spirited, but she was distracted easily, and had often been described as too hyper.</span>

Satisfaction burned inside silver blue optics as Juniperpaw took notice of Tigerpaw’s sudden interest in the camp entrance. Perhaps she was considering his idea? He had only been partially serious, of course, but then again it <em>did</em> sound fun. He had snuck out of camp a pawful of times before, as most apprentices did. Thus far he’d never been caught, which only added to his confidence that they could make it out and back undetected. 

He got to his paws, swishing his fluffy tail through the air and taking a few steps, glancing back at Tigerpaw over his shoulder. <strong>”Well, only one way to find out, right?”</strong> He inquired, a grin parting his lips. His voice remained level, though his toes were tingling with excitement at the idea of sneaking out with Tigerpaw. He didn’t wish to disclose that with the she-cat, however.</span>

Tigerpaw&#39;s heartbeat was steady but clear, a hard to ignore pin in her chest. Standing beside Juniperpaw, she tried to find comfort in the depths of his blue eyes. Her pink ones shone nervously, and a small nervous smile accompanied them. Her tail swished low to the ground in tandem with his.

It seemed his companion was really struggling with this. She seemed ecstatic to move on to this next part of her life, but it was obvious she seemed nervous as well. This was a big change, they no longer could goof off and do whatever they pleased, they needed to act their age. Not everyone wanted to let go of their childhood that easily, and she seemed worried that it was going to impact her experience. <strong>”I don’t think they’ll find you annoying. It’s their job to teach you, and if you’re confused and unable to figure something out then they should help you more.”</strong> it was simple. If they weren’t doing their job correctly, then they need to do better. The apprentice needed to be the one learning, and the mentor was the one instructing. He didn’t plan on being a nuisance to his mentor though, he didn’t need his mother to enact her wrath on him for doing something stupid that required reprimanding. 

<em>Though she’s not a troublemaker, not that I’ve heard anyways. She’s nice and if she’s so worried about this, I’m sure she’ll do okay. I dunno why she’s so anxious about it.</em>

He always had a very level head for a kit, he could remain calm even when it was a bit chaotic. He didn’t like loud noises, but if any of his siblings were scared, he liked putting up a stoic, calm front so they wouldn’t feel as scared. He thought he had to be strong and mature for them, to make sure they had someone to look up to at least. StarClan knows how many times his siblings found themselves into tricky situations. He had to help get them out of them. Maybe he could help other kits out as well with that. <strong>”Whatever happens, I’m sure it’ll be all right. Just hope for the best, it’s not really in your control and I’m sure it’ll be okay.”</strong>

It was a fine day, with the large globe that provided the world beneath it with light letting it&#39;s rays run loose over the forest like a river over stones.  There was no clouds that Marigolddust could see besides some wisps that made them look more like foam than any true cloud.  Accompanying the decent weather, the air was warm and the humidity made his ash colored fur feel as if it was inevitably matted.  
           With a twitched of his ear, Marigolddust gently set the mouse he had caught on the prey pile.  Fortunately for him he had gathered enough confidence to feel more comfortable in his environment, although he still found himself nervous around any of the darker shadows or exceptionally large trees.  Feeling proud, he expressed a satisfied smile.  Today was a decently calm day, and he felt more at peace than he usually did.  Turning, he padded over to the side of the camp in his normal spot, leaning some of his weight against the stone wall of the haven.  Curling his tail around his paws, he lowered himself into a laying position with a calm sigh.  <span class="mention" title="Alexander Phantomhive#5197">@Shadow</span></span>

The other kits words soothed Wrenkit, and now she found herself feeling silly for being so worked up in the first place. Coyotekit was younger than her, yet seemed to have a calm and mature disposition of a cat many moons her senior. She almost felt envious. <em>I must seem like a helpless mewling kit being so worried about something so trivial,</em> she thought to herself, sinking her canines softly into her lower lip. Still, she was grateful for his words of encouragement. <strong>”Thanks, Coyotekit. You’re right,”</strong> she replied with a soft smile. 

Dark amber optics flickered towards the moon as it slowly rose into the black sky, a wide yawn parting her jaws. Though she was beginning to feel tired, Wrenkit also felt restless. All this talk about becoming an apprentice had her paws itching to be out of the camp, to finally have the freedom to leave the confines of the stone walls. She would never dare to sneak out, but it was times like these when she really wanted to. It wasn’t worth the scolding she would receive, still, curiosity burned within her and she found herself staring longingly at the camp entrance. 

<strong>”Do you ever think about sneaking out?”</strong> She asked suddenly. <strong>”I never would, but sometimes I <em>think</em> about what it would be like to run through the forest. Sometimes I feel like I just need to run,”</strong> she added with a shrug. Perhaps her hyperactive tendencies would be subdued slightly once she became an apprentice. Hunting and training would serve as a good outlet for all of her pent up energy. For now, however, even though her eyelids were beginning to droop with sleepiness, she still felt like she could have run laps around the camp.</span>

Only the sound of his own name caused confusion to spark up in the young warrior’s optics.&#160; Sitting up, he glanced around in an attempt to try and place wherever he had been called.&#160; Unfortunately it seemed that whoever was trying to get his attention was concealed somewhere in the camp, or Marigolddust was too tired to truly realize where they were.&#160; Standing, he took another glance around, unsureness brushing his fur into an uneven blanket.&#160; Finally, he spotted the apprentice out of the other cats crowding the camp.&#160; At the mention of a tree, he hesitated.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<em><strong><em>”Interesting about a tree?&#160; I’m not sure what you mean,”</em></strong></em> he said softly, padding carefully to the tree and young tom, who’s name had yet to come to mind.&#160; <em><strong><em>”If it’s a prey of some sort I think you&#39;re allowed to try and catch it, since it’s in the camp walls, but I might ask Icestar first if you’re worried about it.”</em></strong></em> he suggested, feeling a bit self conscious at the fact that he was the cat who was chosen to investigate.&#160; Going up to the tree, he glanced up a it’s branches.&#160; He felt a bit woozy at the idea that something might be up there looking back down at him, hidden behind the new leaves on the branches.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; <em><strong><em>”You don’t mean dangerously interesting, right?”</em></strong></em> he asked reluctantly, keeping his eyes on the branches.&#160; If there was anything up there he should be concerned about, he didn’t want to look away and give it a chance to pounce on him.</span>

<em>Bark?</em>&#160; What was interesting about bark?&#160; It didn’t seem like it was anything like blue, white, red, or yellow from where he was.&#160; Eventually he assumed this apprentice had an odd fascination in bark.&#160; Why else would they call another cat over?&#160; There could be a bug of some sort that wasn’t all that common or some sort of irregular moss.&#160; Marigolddust wasn’t the most intent on using up his time examining bark, but he also didn’t have the heart that most cats had.&#160; Hr would prefer not to disappoint the apprentice.&#160; A few minutes of his time was worth sparing the day for another, wasn’t it?&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; Deciding it was best not to refuse such a wholesome request, he slowly rounded the tree, stopping where Truthpaw told him to.&#160; Again, he found himself confused.&#160; Even when he squinted he didn’t see much of anything important or interesting.&#160; Maybe it was a little more flaky than most of the trees in the forest, and there was a little bit of moss clinging to the trunk of the tree.&#160; There was an ant or two, even a long legged spider.&#160; That was decently fascinating.&#160; Yet he decided to ask the question stuck in his head anyways.&#160; <em><strong><em>”What exactly am I supposed to look for?&#160; The pattern is quite… interesting, that’s true,”</em></strong></em> he said, trying as best as he could to figure out what had caught the eyes of the tabby.</span>

Again, confusion swept over him when he felt something press against his flank, then another, then another.&#160; His heart skipped a beat and he froze, believing that it might had been a snake that could have fallen from the branches above.&#160; But, when he took more notice of the increased pressure of the bark on his side and the fact that Truthpaw had taken a few steps back he glanced down.&#160; Instead of the body of a snake he found a nbit of a thick vine, and his heart dropped as he realized his paw’s couldn’t touch the soil beneath him.&#160; Perhaps he shouldn’t have looked so high in the tree for anything eye-catching.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; Nervous, he wanted to figit or move some part of himself, but a the same time he was too scared to do so.&#160; What if the vines were loose enough to let him go if he moved too much?&#160; Instead, only the tip of his tail swayed back and forth anxiously.&#160; Releasing a nervous chuckle, he looked away from the vines and at Truthpaw.&#160; <em>***”Congratulations, you tricked me!… but can I get down now?” he asked, anxiety rising the longer he was attached to the tree.&#160; He had a bad history with trees, and the last thing he wanted to do was relive it.&#160; That’s why he avoided trees when hunting, patrolling, or helping Fernpaw with herbs.&#160; Now he was *tied</em> to a tree, and from Truthpaw’s body language it seemed clear that he wasn’t going to be freed any time soon.</span>

Slightly exhausted but content from a recent training session, the pale apprentice had her paws splayed on in the cool shade of camp, a pair of dark lavender eyes glancing upwards at the large shape of a deputy passing by.

<strong>&quot;Hello,&quot;</strong> she greeted with a wave of her tail, clearly in a good mood today for she didn&#39;t frown or shoot an insult off to the side, deputy or not. Neither did she try and look away and pretend she didn&#39;t exist for the time being, either. In other words - she was having a very nice time.

 Marbledpaw pushed herself into a respectable sitting position, watching, and deciding that she wanted to go out for a walk, maybe, again.</span>

The coming of nightfall was prompting natural, tired responses from each of the kits in the clan. Even he was feeling fatigue, his eyelids growing heavy as he let out a small yawn. He’d better return to the Highledge before he was too tired to climb back up, but he could stick around for a little while longer. At least to answer her last question out of courtesy. <strong>”No.”</strong> like most of his answers, it was quick, simple and to the point. Then followed by a more thorough elaboration of his response. <strong>”If I attempted that, my mother would harshly punish me for sure. I wouldn’t blame her either, supposedly it’s super dangerous for kits out there.”</strong> his pale gaze wandered over towards the exit of camp, following up to the tree canopies that hung over the camp almost as if they were tempting the more adventurous kits into the outside world where danger could ensnare them like bear traps. While they would be able to freely traverse this new land once they came of age, it was still filled with the same dangers they’d face if they were to go out there now, but they had their mentors to guide them. They wouldn’t fall for dangerous traps nor let the world get the jump on them. <strong>”It won’t be much longer, Wrenkit. Once we begin our training, we can run through the forest to our heart’s content. It’ll be safer that way, and we can’t get into trouble for it.”</strong> a logical conclusion, he wasn’t one to stick his neck out for no reason at all.

Coyotekit let out another yawn, this one more apparent this time. He was growing more and more exhausted, it was time that he began to hit the hay and finally rest his little head. The young tom scratched his chin as he peered back to Wrenkit, shaking his head a bit. <strong>”It’s not you, I’m just… Getting sleepy.”</strong> his voice grew sluggish, laced with grogginess as he then turned towards the Highledge. <strong>”I’ll see you… later… Wrenkit.”</strong> he was rubbing his eyes now as he began to pad away, he really needed to get back to the den before he collapsed on the steps leading up to the Highledge, he didn’t want his mom or dad carrying him back up to their nest when he was at this age! He could handle making his way back to the den even in his tired state. His pawsteps were heavy, and he had quite the climb ahead of him. He had to focus on avoiding slipping and falling so he could just flop over into the nest and finally give in to his torpor and pass out into a deep slumber.

As she picked up on a gentle greeting belonging to that of a nearby apprentice, the burly tortoiseshell turned to face the paler-toned molly sitting up nearby. A soft, lopsided smile graced her deeply-scarred features as she prepared to return the greeting to the young apprentice. <strong>”Hello to you as well, Marbledpaw.”</strong> her bushy tail swished around behind her, her heterochromatic gaze glinting for a moment in the sunlight, as if they flashed with a friendly eagerness to speak with her clanmate. The deputy always enjoyed an engaging conversation with the youth of her clan. It was always good to check on how the apprentices of her clan and how their training was faring. Even if she was not their mentor, she felt obligated to be mindful of them and to ensure they were comfortable and excelling in their tutelage as they should be. Besides, she also liked to know what the next generation of the clan was providing, the state of the entire clan would be in their paws one day. She wanted to see if she could predict how they’d succeed her own.

<strong>”How’ve you been, dear? Is your training going well?”</strong> she tended to address the apprentices of her clan like they were her own kits to look after. She wanted to be a figure they could turn to for support, even if they were not family. Laurelblaze adored kits, and in turn it tended to extend to apprentices as well. The deputy always had a fondness and felt an obligation to be nurturing to them, she’d defend them as if they were her own. Came with kitsitting her younger siblings when they were young, and now her own children. Besides, she was meant to protect her clanmates like they were her flesh and blood. It was her duty as deputy.

She pulled her tail closer to her as the tortie approached, gently tugging the kestrel feather closer to her as some sort of assurance. The tie of the vine was loose, now, and she fastened the vine tighter, teeth clamping on the edge firmly. <strong>&quot;I&#39;ve been-&quot;</strong> wide violets glanced up to a suddenly very <em>close</em> mound of a cat.

She lifted her chest, keeping herself from shrinking away as a natural instinct. <em>Dear.</em> She blinked upwards. No one had called her that since Hazelhues left. <strong>*&quot;Marbledpaw.&quot;</strong> she corrected before she could stop herself, the words slipping rapidly out of her tongue with little filter. 

<strong>&quot;My training has been going very well,&quot;</strong> she said with a soft purr, the nearly foreign action tightening her throat. <em>Fernpaw doesn&#39;t mind her her, so she must be.. decent.</em> <strong>&quot;My mentor and I were just hunting. And.. you?&quot;</strong> the inquiry was friendly, a sheepish grin appearing.

<strong>&quot;Must be a good time to be deputy,&quot;</strong> she mewed with a slight twitch of her whiskers, noting the greenleaf prey. Mostly as an ice-breaker - and to stop herself from nervously laughing at completely nothing. She paused a little, pale purple lanterns looking up curiously. <strong>&quot;Have you been busy lately?&quot;</strong></span>

A mere slip of the tongue led her to realize her mistake and she dipped her head in a quick apology to the apprentice. <strong>”Sorry, Marbledpaw. I call a lot of cats that. Forgive me, I won’t make that mistake again.”</strong> she murmured, her ears flickering. It became habit for her when she was around her kits that it seemed to be translating to others apparently. That wasn’t necessarily a good thing either, she’d have to be more mindful of what she said to others in the future, unless they were fine with it. <strong>”I’m glad things are going well for you then, what did you catch out there?”</strong> she tilted her head as she inquired as to what prey was roaming about. Might give an indication of where to send the next patrols if it meant bigger, better morsels of prey were roaming around the area. <em>Imagine if we found a whole warren of rabbits!</em> the thought was <em>delectable</em>, the clan might be fed for an entire <em>moon</em> if that happened!

Then, Marbledpaw’s comment elicited a small sigh from the deputy in question, before being followed by an amused chuckle. <strong>”More like a busy time, I gotta send out more patrols than ever to make sure our coffers are filled with prey and that everyone is getting enough to eat. I’m almost always on my paws moving around, which sucks because the heatwaves are coming.”</strong> while she had long since shed away her thick, winter coat, her fur was still dense and long. It was still not exactly the most pleasant time of year for her. Especially when she was working so much. <strong>”Yeah, needless to say, I’m busy pretty much from dawn til dusk this entire season… And all year.”</strong>

Getting over his fear of trees… that was an outcome that Marigolddust couldn’t see.&#160; Truthfully, he found his fur spiking up more than it would have the day before, even if he had been leaning against a tree.&#160; He wasn’t accustomed to being in, or on, a tree without being able to touch the ground.&#160; Climbing trees was the last thing he wanted to do whenever he thought of training or possibly mentoring in the future.&#160; Even if he was in the tree alone instead of with another cat, he wasn’t sure he could trust the thick branches he might find himself clinging to.&#160; But now he was experiencing yet another nerve-racking experience with trees and another cat.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; Trying to calm himself a bit, he gave a try at a confident smile; unfortunately he didn’t succeed at it.&#160; <em><strong><em>”I-I’m not freaking out, this is just… inconvenient… I should be…”</em></strong></em> he began, trailing off as he tried to come up with an excuse.&#160; Maybe he could scare Truthpaw into freeing him?&#160; No, he wasn’t one for scaring.&#160; He decided to go for a more truthful excuse instead.&#160; <em><strong><em>”Hunting!”</em></strong></em> he finished with a nod that was far too strong to be convincing.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; As Marigolddust waited in suspense for what seemed like forever, he got a good look at the apprentice who had tied him to the tree.&#160; Long fur, brown tabby, green eyes.&#160; Why exactly he was noticing all of this, he wasn’t sure.&#160; Perhaps it was to distract himself.&#160; The hard, rough bark rubbing against his side and the continual laughter coming from the younger tom stressed him out.&#160; Perhaps this was why he seemed to befriend she-cats more than toms.&#160; First Lavenderpaw pushed him out of a tree and bullied him, now he was being bullied by this stranger apprentice.&#160; An apprentice… How in all of Starclan had he let himself wound up in this situation?&#160; Shame began to bubble inside his chest alongside his fear, which was caused both by the tree and the idea of cats in camp seeing him in the situation.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The pale light of dawn accompanied by the shrill melodies of birdsong had drawn Wrenkit from her nest quite early. Amber eyes still heavy from sleep, dainty white paws dragging, she positioned herself just outside the nursery to observe the camp. Even as a younger kit, Wrenkit had enjoyed waking up early. Now that she was nearly an apprentice, it was part of her daily routine. She often looked on as the patrols were organized and sent on their way, and of course the best part of it all was watching the sun rise over the forest. The first rays of golden sun were setting the treetops ablaze now, and before long the ThunderClan camp would be bathed in the warm light. 

As she sat on her own, the brown and cream kits mind wandered. Very soon, she would be an apprentice and have her own role in camp life. No longer would she be a mere observer, she’d be a part of the very thing she’d spent so many moons observing. There was a time when Wrenkit felt as if she’d be a kit forever, confined to the camp to never see the outside world. Now, as her sixth moon rapidly approached, she realized she would be saying goodbye to her kithood and earning a real place among her clanmates. The thought sent shivers down her spine of both excitement, and apprehension. There would be so much to learn and so much to do. She had watched the apprentices as they came and went, quite the busybodies they were. She knew what would be expected of her as an apprentice, and yet she wondered if she could handle it as well as they could. Wrenkit gave a small shake of her head, swiping her tongue across an ivory paw and rubbing it over her dark brown ears. There was no point in sitting here worrying about what was to come. For now, she could just enjoy the sunrise.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Another kitten preparing to let go of his nursery nest sat quietly. 
Foxkit and his gaggle of siblings were nearing the start of their &#39;paw&#39; days. Outside the safety boundaries of ThunderClan&#39;s camp lay a world full of danger, adventure and mischief. 
And Foxkit wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to join that world. Historically, life for a cat who could only hear in one ear never went well. Long ago, when the ancient Firestar was a warrior, a deaf kitten got carried out of camp by a hawk. Foxkit feared that the same fate faced him. 

His thoughts consuming him, Fox didn&#39;t notice Wrenkit peeking out of the nursery.

She’d never spoken to the tom, but she knew who he was. They shared a den, of course. <strong>”Goodmorning, Foxkit!”</strong> Came the young molly’s chipper mew. She didn’t know much about the tom, aside from the fact that they were close in age. Soon they would be sharing a different den together. 

She took a deep breath, pulling the crisp morning air into her lungs. As the sun rose higher, it began to bathe the edge of the clearing with light. <strong>”Its a pretty morning, isn’t it? Soon we will get to spend our mornings outside of camp. I’m excited for that,”</strong> she said, a grin adorning her lips.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Warm greetings broke through his fearful thoughts, snapping him back to present day. Foxkit glanced up to meet the voice. <strong>&quot;Oh, good morning Wrenkit&quot;</strong> Wrenkit&#39;s face was familiar, though he knew little about her. <em>&#39;Wouldn&#39;t hurt to make some friends before you leave the den&#39;</em> He thought to himself. <em>&#39;Featherkit, Tigerkit and Viperkit won&#39;t always be there when you are&#39;</em>. Determined to make a good impression, Fox offered Wren a friendly smile. <strong>&quot;It is. I like to sleep later than this, but sometimes I just wake up and can&#39;t get back to sleep&quot;</strong> Especially with three overgrown meatheads wriggling next to him. 

Foxkit leaned into the sunlight, enjoying how warmed his bones through his thin fur. <strong>&quot;Me too, well, if Icestar let&#39;s me be an apprentice&quot;</strong> Blue eyes shifted away from her gaze, suddenly taking interest in the yellowing grass beneath him. <strong>&quot;I dunno how good a warrior I&#39;d make, since I can only hear on my right side&quot;</strong> 
Way to ruin the mood, Fox.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Upon receiving a friendly smile in return from the tom, Wrenkit felt relieved. She always went through several moments of worry when greeting another cat, afraid that they wouldn’t want to talk to her. Foxkit seemed cheerful though, and already she was hoping they would become friends. Wrenkit would befriend anyone, really. <strong>”I love being up early. I always seem to wake up around dawn, even if I don’t try to. I like watching the camp wake up,”</strong> she added with a little giggle. Being used to waking early would probably be a good thing once she was apprenticed.  


Wrenkit tipped her head to the side quizzically at his words. What did he mean <em>if</em> Icestar let him? A sympathetic expression fell over her features as Foxkit told her about his partial deafness, and she was quick to rest her tail over his shoulders comfortingly for a moment. <strong>”Awe, nonsense! You’re going to be a great warrior.”</strong> Wrenkit said encouragingly. She meant it, too. She was sure he could adapt to only being able to hear out of one ear, he just needed some practice. <strong>”Icestar has to at least give you a chance. I bet with a little practice you’ll learn how to make it work for you. You’ll be just as good a warrior as the rest of us,”</strong> she purred. <span class="mention" title="AIMSIR#9490">@cobra</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Bouncepaw had been training by Laurelblaze&#39;s side, working hard trying to trust her skills that she was learning and her own body. She hadn&#39;t known why she was like this but she was very gentle and didn&#39;t like fighting, the thing was she wanted to fight and hunt, it just wasn&#39;t in her brain to. Any prey she even scared off she said sorry to, although she did that when her mentor wasn&#39;t watching. 

This was just another training day it seemed and she was to meet her mentor in camp to see if they were training for fighting or hunting, or if they were really training at all. <strong>&quot;I love training, I really do, it&#39;s just... I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so difficult for me.&quot;</strong> She meowed silently to herself, <strong>&quot;I mean I have never wanted to hurt anycreature but I want to be useful to the clan and prove myself worthy.&quot;</strong> She grumbled, brushing her paws lightly on the ground as she walked. 

She often wondered if she was a kittypets but she knew it wasn&#39;t right for her, besides, abandoning her clan would be pointless, and abandoning her clan when they need her generation most isn&#39;t fair. <strong>&quot;Well, this&#39;ll be a long day.&quot;</strong> She sighed with a shrug, limbering up her muscles with different and effective stretches.

The day was bright and sunny out, a perfect day to get out into the woods and spend time with her apprentices and actually train. She typically kept their lessons separate for their own sake, being able to dedicate time to each of them so they could go over what they’d learned in the day and so neither of them fell behind. Besides, Bouncepaw was older than Tigerpaw and therefore farther along in her training compared to the much younger molly. Laurelblaze had to make sure she was ready for her warriors’ assessment. Six moons seemed like a long time, but before any of them knew it, it arrived. It was her duty as their mentor to make sure they were up to snuff, and she put them both through the wringer.

Speaking of which, there was one of her little students now… Idling around in camp it seemed. <em>Can’t blame her, not like they can go out without a kitsitter practically.</em> she let out a small sigh as she approached the young she-cat with a small smile. <strong>”Hey, Bouncepaw.”</strong> she greeted her apprentice with a small dip of her skull, her tail flickering around behind her as she approached. <strong>”You busy? I was wondering if you wanna go hunting for a bit, get out of camp, no?”</strong>

Well, even if she said no, they needed to get some training in. Though Laurelblaze wanted to start her off with something easy, nothing too grueling. A warm-up, essentially, for what was to come later on. <strong>”Come on, while it’s still light out! We can get so much done today!”</strong>

Foxkit turned back to her, appreciation shimmering in his wide eyes. Laurelblaze and Hollyfrost - who he&#39;d come to know as Ma and Mother - were often busy when he needed their words of support. Featherkit seemed to have selective hearing, always in a world on his own, while Viperkit and Tigerkit never knew how to pick him up. 

<em>&#39;See, making friends is good!&#39;</em>

Fox giggled. <strong>&quot;I guess you&#39;re right. There used to be a ThunderClan warrior, way back when Firestar was a warrior, who had no eye or ear! She got attacked by a dog&quot;</strong> He focused, trying to recant the story he&#39;d heard from the elders accurately. <strong>&quot;She learnt how to be a warrior with only one eye and ear! I guess if she could do it, I can too&quot;</strong>. Feeling better and coming out of his shell, he yearned for more conversation. <strong>&quot;Who do you think your mentor will be?&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Wrenkit felt her own hopes soar as Foxkit seemed to cheer up almost instantly at her words. She felt very pleased that she had been able to help him, and a small purr rumbled in her chest. The story that he told her sounded familiar, and she was sure she remembered hearing it from the elders at one point. She loved listening to the elders telling tales of the history of the clans, and she knew so many it was hard to remember them all. She scrunched her face up a bit as if deep in thought, trying to remember the particular cat he was speaking of. 

<strong>”Brightheart! Her name was Brightheart,”</strong> she suddenly blurted out, grinning from ear to ear. <strong>”If she could be a great warrior without an eye or an ear, you’ll be just fine. You’ll show every cat that you don’t need to hear out of both ears.”</strong> Wrenkit pondered his next question for a while, having thought about the topic a lot over the past half moon. <strong>”I’m not sure who Icestar will chose for me, but… I hope Marigolddust will be my mentor. He’s always so nice to me, he even helped me with my hunters crouch!”</strong> She explained, amber eyes glowing as the thought fondly of the warrior. She thought he would make the perfect mentor. He seemed to be able to tolerate her hyperactive nature, which was a huge bonus. <strong>”Who would you want, if you got to pick?”</strong>

That was her name&quot;</strong> Foxkit could picture the maimed she-cat in his head with a proud glisten in her remaining eye. She endured much worse than loss of hearing in one ear, he could do it! <strong>&quot;Thanks Wrenkit&quot;</strong> He felt a lot lighter, like a weight had jumped off his shoulders.  <strong>&quot;Well... obviously I would like Laurelblaze or Hollyfrost, but I think they have apprentices already&quot;</strong> Plus he doubted Icestar would like either of his parents mentor him for the sake of bias. <strong>&quot;Needletailstripe, maybe? She seems nice&quot;</strong> Foxkit&#39;s mind drifted to a new topic. <strong>&quot;I&#39;d like my warrior name to be something cool, like Foxtooth or Foxtooth. What about you, Wrenkit?&quot;</strong>

She was glad that she could make her new friend feel better. That’s what friends were for, right? <em>Laurelblaze?</em> Wrenkit couldn’t hide the surprise that laced her expression at his response. Personally, she thought that having the clan deputy for a mentor would make her too anxious. Then again, a lot of things made her anxious. She was already worried about pleasing whoever her mentor would be. 

<strong>”I’d be too worried to mess up in front of Laurelblaze… I mean, I don’t wanna mess up in front of my own mentor either but…”</strong> she trailed off with a little shrug. She could see the appeal of being able to tell others that your mentor was the deputy, though. Her attention quickly turned to his next question, which was one she hadn’t actually thought of. <strong>”Oh, warrior names! I haven’t thought much about that to be honest. Foxtooth is a <em>super</em> cool name! I don’t know what I’d want. Wrenfeather maybe? Since I’m named after a bird and they have feathers, ya know,”</strong> she explained followed by a little giggle. There were so many name possibilities, her mind started reeling thinking about what she would be called one day.

Stepping forward to the edge of the now familiar cliff edge, Icestar took in the beautiful landscape of her home. It had been a while since so many of her Clanmates were transitioning to another rank at the same time. She smiled slightly. The Clan was developing so well and peace was firmly established. She hoped it was going to last for a while longer. Shifting her body, she then opened her maw to gather the Clan.

<strong>” All cats who are old enough to catch their own prey, gather around for a Clan meeting!”</strong> Icestar announced. It was nearing the end of the day. Patrol activity was to spike up after sharing tongues and a hearty meal but it could be delayed for an extra heartbeat or two. With the clearing mainly full due to her resting warriors, it shouldn’t take long for a crowd to form and attentively raise their gaze up to her.

The sound of the silver point&#39;s call caught the warrior&#39;s attention, causing him to straighten.  Just moments before, he had been lying down and resting from a long tiring trip.  Yawning, he stationed himself onto his paws and lazily padded out of Fernpaw&#39;s den after offering her a small smile.  Sleepily, the tuxedo joined the crowd of warriors and apprentices who had collected around the tower of a stone.  Glancing up at Icestar with a flash of curiosity in his eyes, he settled down towards the outside of the group.  Curling his tail around his own paws, Marigolddust tried to figure out who around him were the cats that would gain a rank that day.  Or... Or maybe something bad had happened?  Could that be the reason behind the summoning?  Given his head a little bit of a shake, he examined Icestar&#39;s demeanor a little bit better.  She seemed decently relaxed, so it was more than likely that this was a laid back ceremony.  Relaxing, he waited patiently for whatever announcements might be said.</span>

His head tipped to the side with curiosity, and alone, he wandered up to the group, not bothering to find his siblings and instead plopping himself down toward the back.

Ocean eyes softened as they drifted down to the line-up of kits. This was going to be a very special ceremony for them. 

<strong>”  Coyotekit, Viperkit, Tigerkit, Featherkit and Wrenkit. You have all reached the age of six moons, and it is time for you to be apprenticed. From this day on, until you receive your warrior name, you will be known as Coyotepaw, Viperpaw, Tigerpaw, Featherpaw and Wrenpaw.”</strong> That was a mouthful but Icestar didn’t appear to have minded it. Her expression was solemn and concentrated as she spoke, wishing for this ceremony to be as good as it can get for the little ones.

<strong>” Coyotepaw,&quot;</strong> her voice warmed as pride filled up within her. <strong>&quot; your mentor will be Strikethroat. Viperpaw, your mentor will be Cinderblaze. Tigerpaw, your mentor will be Finchbrair. Featherpaw, your mentor will be me and Wrenpaw, your mentor will be Marigolddust.”</strong> 

Her masked face turned to the crowd, beckoning the named warriors up the Highledge to join their apprentices.

The silver tabby perked right up as her name was called suddenly. Leaf-green eyes focused on her new apprentices, curiosity and pure joy sparking within them. It had been a while since she had an apprentice and she had begun to miss having another friend! A brief moment of silence washed over her at the thought of Twoface. <em>I won’t lose this one, will I?</em> She wondered, worried that she would have to mourn again.

<em>I won’t!</em> She brushed away the dark thoughts. Hopping right up onto her paws, Cinderblaze weaved through the throng of felines and trotted right up to the Highledge.</span>

As the deputy padded out into the clearing upon hearing the call from the leader atop the Highledge, she took her seat nearby her kits. This was a big day for her youngest kits to be promoted, the ones she’d found along with her mate just a few moons prior. Oh how the time flew by! They were already going to be apprentices, taking the next step in their lives as warriors.

She was going to try so, <em>so</em> hard to not burst into tears out of joy and sadness. She didn’t want to embarrass her kits today, this was their moment to shine.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">{Coyotekit} | Ceremonies</div>
To say the young tom was nervous was an understatement. He swore he could feel his mother’s gaze bearing into him from the Highledge, even if she was only just watching the growing crowd of cats. Son of the leader, becoming an apprentice at last. He wanted to make her proud. Still, the hustle and bustle of the cats around him made him only a bit more uncomfortable, he never liked the confined feeling of other cats around him. Still, he had to keep his head held up high for them all to see he was truly ready.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">{Viperkit} | Ceremonies</div>
She practically had to be dragged out of her nest by her siblings, because it was some special ceremony because she reached six moons of age. That meant she was getting <em>another</em> name change and was becoming an apprentice. <em>’So what! As soon as I’m trained, I’m getting out of here. This isn’t my home, and I’m gonna make sure I can survive out there when I finally make my escape!’</em> she thought triumphantly, this was just another step in her grand scheme!</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Did she just say my name?</em> At first, Wrenkit wasn’t sure if she’d heard Icestar correctly. Time seemed to slow, and the cats that huddled around her seemed to fade into the background. <em>I’m becoming an apprentice… now? Right now?</em> This was a day that every kit dreamed of, yet nothing could have prepared her for the ball of nerves that sat heavy as a stone in her stomach. Her heart pounded loudly within her chest, so loud she feared that the entire clan could hear it. A grin spread across her lips, so wide it made her cheeks hurt, and forcing herself to remain steady, she padded towards the Highledge. Wrenpaw. She was Wrenpaw now. 

As if her newly acquired name wasn’t enough excitement for the young molly, she then heard who her mentor would be. Marigolddust? Her eyes frantically searched for him among the sea of warriors, paws working furiously at the earth below her. <em>No way!</em> The she-cat felt giddy with excitement, and it took everything in her power not to begin bouncing around the clearing. The idea of embarrassing herself with the entire clan watching kept her rooted in place.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Suddenly hearing his name being called, his blue eyed widened with surprise. Was he in trouble? <em>It&#39;s time for you to be apprenticed.</em> Oh. How cool! Though, as he noticed one of his sisters basically being dragged in by his other siblings, he couldn&#39;t help but to snort. He truly didn&#39;t understand her distaste toward ThunderClan. They were safe, they were warm, and they were fed. What more could they possibly want?

As he noticed the other kits padding forward, he blinked. He supposed he had to do that too. Moving forward with the rest, he shuffled awkwardly into the line-up they had created. Looking back, Viperkit was no where in sight. Sighing, he ran back, hissing: <strong>&quot;c&#39;mon! There&#39;s nothing you can do to get out of it!&quot;</strong> Grabbing her practically by the ear, he pulled her forward, which wasn&#39;t done without a fight, surely. He shoved her into the line-up, and began to listen to Icestar&#39;s words. For once.

As she began to list out mentors, he kept his ears pricked for his own. He didn&#39;t recognize any of the names, but, he was met with confusion as a name wasn&#39;t listed after his name. <em>Huh? Me? Who&#39;s me?</em> He glanced around, confused, until he finally realized that she meant that <em>she</em> was mentoring him. <em>Oh, that&#39;s cool!</em> Grinning, he watched as the other mentors came to meet their new apprentices. He glanced up at Icestar with confusion. <em>Will she come down to meet me?</em> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> <span class="mention" title="Iceywicey#3780">@Ice</span></span>

The young tom had to process his new name for a moment. <em>No longer Coyotekit… I’m Coyotepaw, apprentice of Strikethroat.</em> he blinked for a moment in silence, reveling in the new identity he’d been given. An apprentice of ThunderClan, he’d be training to become a warrior and he’d do his clan proud. He had to, he didn’t want to disappoint them all.

He looked around the crowd for a moment, realizing this was probably one of the last few times he’d get to stand on this ledge, he would be in the apprentice’s den from tonight until he earned his warrior name. It was a bit of a melancholy thought, but it was for the best. He had to get used to crowded dens anyways.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">{Viperpaw} | Ceremonies</div>
Oh she was <em>so</em> gonna get vengeance for Featherkit forcing her into the line of kits waiting to be apprenticed. <strong>”Just you wait, Feather! I swear that you’re gonna get a good swatting later!”</strong> she whisper-hissed into his ears as Icestar began to list out their new names. She was Viper<em>paw</em> now, big whoop. She’ll still beat up anyone who even dared to look at her wrong. Her sky-blue gaze was narrowed, and an annoyed expression was plastered on her face as she approached her new mentor, Cinderblaze. 

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">{Finchbriar}</div>
Rolling her eyes, the pale tan tabby approached her new apprentice, Tigerpaw with an unimpressed expression on her features. She looked the little runt up and down with a narrowed gaze and let out a small scoff. <strong>”You’d better behave, kit, I’m not mentoring some lazy weakling. Better be worth my while.”</strong>

Jumping at the loud volume of her voice, he turned to see Tigerpaw next to him.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh, no, I don&#39;t think so- you just made it,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said with a small smile and a nodd.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Although, if I were you I *might</em> be perhaps a bit quieter,&quot;*</strong></em> he whispered just as Icestar began to speak.  @Shade#2140</span>

             All of the relaxation evaporated out of him when he heard his own name said.  Stiffening, he tried to register whatever he had heard only moments before.  Why was he mentioned?  It took a few moments for the realization to finally dawn on him, seeing Icestar&#39;s gesture.  Feeling his heart sink, he gulped, trying to push down the nerves that had bubbled up to the surface.  You can&#39;t keep them waiting, he reminded himself, needing to repeat the sentence a few times in his thoughts for him to finally stand and get his paws moving.  Holding his breath, he joined the others on the Highledge, anxiety slowing his movements, if only slightly.  
          Marigolddust&#39;s apprehensive nature kept him from getting excited, although as he glanced over at Wrenkit he tried to reasure himself.  He could help but fear that he was going to be a terrible mentor, and although he would never want to ruin such a kind and cheerful kit&#39;s life like he expected he would, he also felt relieved that he didn&#39;t end up with a apprentice like Truthpaw.  Spying the soon-to-be-apprentice as her excitement flew, his worries couldn&#39;t hold back his smile.  Maybe this wouldn&#39;t be a terrible experience?  Only maybe.
           Hesitating for a moment, he made his way down to Wrenkit before clearing his throught softly to get her attention, noticing that she seemed a little confused as to where he was.  Once he met eyes with the excited kitten, he couldn&#39;t help but feel nervous yet again.  She was his first apprentice.  What if he messed this up right from the start?  Was there a specific way that he was supposed to touch noses with her?  Forcing the thoughts to the back of his head, he smiled and bent down, touching noses with the joyful she-cat.  @tremb#3692</span>

Almost as if it wasn&#39;t Cloverpaw herself standing up there just a few moons ago... In this clan, it appeared you had to earn everything. And deep down she would always be nothing but a rogue kit. The scrawny black and white femme watched, though, because it seemed she was gaining a whole new influx of denmates. What a joy. After being apprenticed to Swiftstorm, many would think Cloverpaw&#39;s mentality had changed - but no. She was still same ole annoyed-by-wussies Clover. 

She supposed there was congratulations in order, though.. even though she was terrible at speaking to other cats while simultaneously being nice. <em>New apprentices.</em> Maybe she could attempt to make new friends? Ugh, it actually seemed way too tiring. Why bother?</span>

She was lying to herself, and she knew it. The moment she heard her kits’ names be uttered aloud, she couldn’t help but to feel the warmth of pride swelling in her chest. She felt tears forming in the corners of her gaze, a wide grin stretching across her features as she watched her four kits stand upon the Highledge alongside their mentors and their peers. The tortoiseshell let out a loud yowl of their names in celebration, as this was their special day! 

<strong>”Viperpaw! Foxpaw! Featherpaw! Tigerpaw! Coyotepaw! Wrenpaw! Viperpaw! Foxpaw! Featherpaw! Tigerpaw! Coyotepaw! Featherpaw!”</strong>

While she cheered for everyone twice, she kept up the loud fanfare for her children, as they deserved all the praise in the world. She couldn’t help but to feel more proud of them in this moment, though she was sure she was going to feel this way again once they became warriors. She’d probably be a wreck and would be sobbing while cheering them on.</span>

Her heart gave a dull pang. Her kits were growing up so fast. The nest was going to feel empty soon as they joined the rest of the Clan down below. 

Once all the mentors have arrived, she was prepared to continue if not for Viperpaw’s rowdy display. A sharp glare was sent towards the apprentice. <em>Behave,</em> she ordered. Those twin flames then danced towards the congregation.

<strong>” You are all ready to take on an apprentice. Strikethroat, you have received excellent training and you have a good heart. You will be the mentor of Coyotekit. Cinderblaze, you have shown to be a kind-hearted and joy-bringer. You will be the mentor of Viperkit. Finchbriar, you have received excellent training from Twoface and you are known for your driven demeanor and clever nature. You will be the mentor of Tigerkit. Ashenfire has mentored me and with my spirit and courage, I will mentor Featherkit. Finally, Marigolddust, Skycloud has trained you and with your loyalty and respect, you will mentor Wrenkit. I expect all of you, including myself, to pass down all that we know onto our apprentices so that they may become warriors we could be proud of.”</strong>

Do you remember when I said I thought it would be cool if you were my mentor? Now you’re my mentor!

Embarrassment washed over her as she realized she was basically yelling at the warrior. <strong>”I’m sorry,”</strong> she added more softly as they touched noses, her claws still working excitedly at the ground. 

It was no secret that Marigolddust wasn’t as excited as Wrenpaw, but she didn’t mind. Even if he didn’t think he would be a good mentor, Wrenpaw knew that he would be. She gazed at the sun as it sank lower in the sky, feeling slightly disappointed that they couldn’t go explore the territory right now. <strong>”What do we do now?”</strong> <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

Cinderblaze’s searching eyes found her new apprentice. It was none other than Viperpaw. A large smile spread across her maw as she hopped over, feathery banner waving in the air. She didn’t seem to acknowledge the angsty behaviour of the apprentice and instead, chose to greet her with a purr of <strong> hello!”</strong> Rapidly, she dove her head right over to the crown of Viperpaw, booping her forehead with her pink nose.

As Icestar began to speak, he listened on with slight confusion plastered across his features. Who were these strange cats she was talking about, and why were they important to the ceremony? Alas, those thoughts soon left his brain as soon as they had entered, and a beaming grin spread out across his face as he looked up at his new mentor. Unlike his spit-fire sister, Featherpaw was rather excited to be an apprentice. Not only would he be able to leave camp once more, but he&#39;d finally be doing something useful! Playing around with those funny mossballs the other kits seemed to adore had been <em>boring.</em> And he had heard from older apprentices that he&#39;d learn how to fight! He trotted forward slightly, paws shuffling with anticipation. He wasn&#39;t really sure what would happen now. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> <span class="mention" title="Iceywicey#3780">@Ice</span></span>

Her eyes flitted to each pair as mentor and apprentice connected for the first time through physical touch. She had always admired this aspect of the ceremony - the bond that was formed in this moment and strengthened overtime. Her gaze lingered on Coyotepaw, watching as her son interacted with Strikethroat. He was a shy and anxious young warrior but this opportunity should develop the confidence he needs. Coyotepaw should also benefit from this. Strikethroat may hopefully cool his temper while drawing out his leadership skills.

Icestar looked over to Featherpaw and happiness rushed over her. It had been a while since she had mentored and the silvery-white molly had already begun to miss it. <strong>” Hey there,”</strong> she mewed to the exciting apprentice, leaning down to gently press her black buttoned nose upon his head. <strong>” I’m guessing you’re the one that keeps your sister in line?”</strong> She teased lightly whilst withdrawing her head.

The young molly tensed up as her rather cheerful mentor touched her nose to her forehead. Her light blue gaze hardened for a moment, and she let out a small sigh as she met her mentor’s gaze. <strong>”Hi.”</strong> she returned the greeting with a forced, awkward smile. She wasn’t exactly excited about being trained to serve a clan she wasn’t too keen about. She wasn’t loyal to these cats, why should she dedicate her life to serving them in the first place? It didn’t make sense to her, she just wanted to go home and roam the forest with her siblings, free. 

Yet she was na&#239;ve, not yet knowing what this life had in store for her. 

So for now, she just stood by her mentor, shuffling her paws and watching her siblings to see if they were faring well. It seemed Featherpaw was clearly pleased with his mentor choice, he got the leader to train him.

The less enthusiastic greeting was noted but Cinderblaze held no hard feelings towards it. Inwardly, she was concerned as to why her apprentice wasn’t as excited as the other fluffballs. <em>Perhaps she is just nervous,</em> she concluded. <em>It’s up to me to make her comfortable!</em> She thought with determination. She may not have as important of a role as her mother, Icestar, but it was vital enough to have even the slightest impact on the Clan.

<strong>” We are going to have a great time!”</strong> She assured with a confident purr as Viperpaw’s eyes travelled over to the others. <strong>” I haven’t had an apprentice in a while. Not since Twoface but I remember a bunch of things that could be useful,”</strong> she chattered on. <strong>” There’s some good hunting spots we can make good use of. Fighting isn’t my forte but I’m sure Eaglewing would help out!”</strong>

He leaned up slightly as she pressed her nose against her forehead, barely able to keep still for those few heartbeats before she pulled away. At her statement, he let out a small giggle. <strong>&quot;When I can,&quot;</strong> Featherpaw replied. His toes prickled as adrenaline rushed through his veins. It felt like not too long ago that a concerned gaze was shot down on him and his siblings, wondering what had happened. He barely remembered time before Hollyfrost and Laurelblaze had found him and the litter, but he knew that he was grateful for what they had done. They had taken them in as their own, and though he was cautious at first, he&#39;d really warmed up to them and the Clan. He knew it would take time for Viperpaw to do the same, but he hoped that she would eventually. Tipping his head to the side, he looked around at all of the new apprentices chatting with their mentors, before looking back toward Icestar. <strong>&quot;So.. what happens now?&quot;</strong> <span class="mention" title="Iceywicey#3780">@Ice</span></span>

A blink accompanied Marigolddust&#39;s startement at the sudden series of words that tumbled out of his new apprentice&#39;s mouth.  A new smile spread across his features, one a bit overwhelmed yet amused.  Until now, the ashy colored tom hadn&#39;t realized how ironic the appointing was.  He recalled being almost as nervous as he was now after he had assisted Wrenkit with her crouch.  <em>I guess I&#39;m going to be doing a lot more than helping her a bit now,</em> he realized, loosening up a little bit, although it might have been because he had begun to feel a bit dizzy.
             <em><strong><em>&quot;No need to apologize, Wren...paw,&quot;</em></strong></em> he reasured, pausing a moment only to fix what could have been a mistake in Wrenpaw&#39;s new identity.  Truthfully, Marigolddust felt a bit awkward as he realized he wasn&#39;t quite sure what they were supposed to do now that the ceremonies had been finished.  It seemed Wrenpaw&#39;s was just as clueless, and so he tried to come up with something.  What had Skycloud told him?  He was supposed to teach what he had been taught, anyhow.  After a moment of running through his memories, he decided on what to say.  <em><strong><em>&quot;We can start training tomorrow, as soon as you&#39;d like, as long as the sun&#39;s visible over the trees around the camp walls.&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, his smile still present on his features.  His nerves had laid dormant for now, and he expected that he would hopefully be able to  collect himself by then.  <em><strong><em>&quot;You... Know where the apprentice&#39;s den is?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, unsure whether or not a mentor needed to teach such a thing.  Rooksnap had taught him, not Skycloud.</span>

Sea-green optics studied her apprentice curiously. He was rather collected for someone of his age. Perhaps he needed to learn to be since he has such temperamental parents. Icestar looked over to Laurelblaze and Hollyfrost with an amused look. The pride in their eyes shone with the brightness of glistening stars. They were great parents for sure and the love they gave to their kits was unmatched. 

Looking back to Featherpaw, Icestar offered a light smile. <strong>” If you want, I can show you around the territory. It is getting late so we won’t be able to cover everything. We can visit the rest the next day. Training is important but rest is equally so. Do you have enough energy for it?”</strong> She didn’t wish to exhaust him further if he was barely able to stay up on his paws. The excitement of the ceremony may have tired him out.

Today had started just like any other day, and she never expected it to end with her becoming an apprentice. <strong>”I always hoped you’d be my mentor, but I never thought you really would be,”</strong> she purred happily, giving a little bounce. Now that the crowd had dispersed, she could finally let out more of her excitement. Her tail tip was twitching rapidly, and she could barely keep her paws in the same place for more than a moment. <strong>”I can’t wait to start training! I’ll be up bright and early tomorrow waiting for you! You can show me the territory, and maybe I can catch a nice fat piece of prey for us to share when we come back to camp, and…”</strong> she trailed off quickly, realizing she was rambling again, and talking much too fast. She took a deep breath in, reminding herself that she needed to act more mature now. 

<strong>”I’m sorry, I’m just so excited. I promise I won’t be like this all the time,”</strong> she murmured, smiling sweetly up at him. She hoped she wouldn’t get on his nerves too quickly. Or overwhelm him. He seemed to overthink things just as much as she did, and she would hate to make things worse for him.

The fanfare after the ceremony had finally died down once they all were dismissed and free to go about their business. She’d gotten settled in the apprentice’s den with the help of her mentor in picking out her nest towards the perimeter of the den. The black-tortoiseshell molly was still a bit of a sourpuss the entire time however, and it was still bleeding into her attitude now, even hours later. What even was the big deal anyways? Sure she’s now an apprentice and gets a name change, but so did every other kit! <em>Wow, I’m not Viperkit anymore, I’m Viperpaw now! I just gotta share that name with everyone else my age!</em> she rolled her eyes as her claws slid out of their sheaths, her tufted ears flattening against her skull as she tensed up for a moment. If she had a long tail, it’d be lashing around like a whip right about now. Instead, her bob tail looked like it was wagging like a little dog’s. This apprentice was clearly a bit of an irritable one.

<em>Whatever, in my mind, I’m always gonna be Viper. No special titles are gonna change that, it’s not like it’s gonna last anyways. One day, I’ll leave this place and never look back!</em>

Her ultimate goal would be on her mind until the day she was given her warrior name. Then, she’d say <em>adieu</em> to ThunderClan, and the clans in general. If her siblings didn’t want to leave with her, then fine, she’d make it on her own. They’d be able to protect themselves by then, she couldn’t be the one to fight their own battles for them all the time! <em>Still can’t believe they actually like it here… These cats are still strange to me,</em> they still baffled the young molly to this day. Their lifestyles, their faith in something called StarClan that they claimed lived in the night sky in a band of stars they called Silverpelt. Could such a thing actually exist? She didn’t know, and part of her didn’t really <em>want</em> to know as it was where their dead warriors lived. She didn’t want to be haunted by ghost cats. Plus, they only had one territory? And they had to stay off other clans’ ones? What was the point of that? It meant less prey for them, it didn’t make sense at all!

<em>These cats sure are dumb, that’s why loners and rogues have it made! We can go wherever we want, whenever we want. Nobody is gonna stop us.</em>

Wrenpaw’s words eased his thoughts even further; a case yet again showing that her reaction to this whole situation wasn’t as poor as his own.&#160; He <em>did</em> wish he could be more excited and care-free, but as always his mind was plagued with anxiety that he was not yet aware that his new apprentice shared with him.&#160; It was always hard, being relaxed, calm, or care-free with a mind like theirs.&#160; But, as always he would deal with it, and try to overcome all that worry clinging so tightly to his flank, making his breaths a bit more shallow.&#160; Part of this was through talking and listening, which did well at keeping him distracted… most times.&#160; Angling his gaze away from Wrenpaw just for a moment, he glanced around to watch the majority of the crowd disperse and hide out in their dens, if not congratulating the new apprentices.&#160; He kept listening, of course, and it didn’t take long for his gae to return to the small caramel furred feline.&#160; Surprisingly, it wasn’t too hard for his cloud-tipped ears to register all that was bouncing off of them, although he couldn’t help but falter at her trailing off.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; By now Marigolddust was quite used to this situation.&#160; Although this might have been only the second time since they had truly had a conversation, it was clear that Wrenpaw was talkative, even if she found she could be annoying.&#160; With his fears now blanketed by exhaustion and some comfort, he offered Wrenpaw a welcoming look.&#160; <em><strong><em>”I don’t mind the rambling all too much,”</em></strong></em> he reassured with a smile.&#160; He prefurred being spoken to much better than speaking, and with Wrenpaw’s wordful nature it reassured that he would almost never have to carry the conversation.&#160; <em><strong><em>”You know where it is already?”</em></strong></em> he repeated, finding himself oddly embarrassed.&#160; Wrenpaw was far more prepared than he was at her age.</span>

He could easily recall when he was convinced the elders&#39; den was the apprentice’s den.&#160; Fortunately Rooksnap had found him before he could do anything too humiliating.  Swerving an ear as if flicking away the thoughts, Marigolddust tried to focus more on what else was said.&#160; <em><strong><em>”Oh, well then, our first ‘lesson’ could be how to properly set up a new nest, unless you already know that too?”</em></strong></em> he said.&#160; Putting up a nest wasn’t too hard, and neither was replacing moss, so he expected that they could get it done and ready before all of Silverpelt made itself visible.&#160;&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160; <em><strong><em>”It’s always nice having friends appointed to a new rank with you,”</em></strong></em> he said with a smile.&#160; Why did it feel like just yesterday when he and Fernpaw were appointed their mentors and given their new names?&#160; This thought made himself feel old, although he was still decently young.&#160; Not even twenty moons yet… oh, did he have to be a certain age to get an apprentice?&#160; Maybe he should have asked or reminded Icestar before all of this.&#160; Averting his thoughts away from the thought, he remembered his most recent ceremony.&#160; The only friend he had graduated with then was his sister.&#160; Oh, how he wished Fernpaw could have gained a rank with him again.&#160; Shaking the topic off of his thoughts, he directed his mind back to what Wrenpaw was saying.&#160; <em><strong><em>”They can be a *little</em> scary, but I think it’ll be much easier having friends with you to keep your confidence up.”*</strong></em> he said, speaking truthfully.&#160; He didn’t exactly know the feeling, but he knew many other cats did.</span>

The amused voice came from behind Foxpaw, in the direction of the warriors den where Needlestripe strode out into the dawned camp. He, along with the other new mentors, had been excused of their patrol duties that day to introduce their fresh apprentices to the territory. It was a sleep-in for him, an early morning for his pupil on the contrary. With a quick glance around the rather empty quarry, Needlestripe realized that the other promotees must still be asleep in their nests. Needless to say he was pleased that his had been the first up and out.
<strong>”You’re not a kit anymore, remember?”</strong> he reminded the young tom gently but firmly, resting the tip of his tail on a ginger-patched white coat as he drew up beside him. He prodded the half-eaten morsel with a claw. <strong>”Now why don’t you start by taking this to one of the elders or queens?”</strong> <span class="mention" title="AIMSIR#9490">@cobra</span></span>

As the cats began to make their way to their dens after the excitement of the apprentice ceremony died down, Wrenpaw was still feeling too wired to even think about sleeping. She had gotten her nest arranged in the apprentices den, but she wasn’t ready to curl into it just yet. She still couldn’t believe that she was finally an apprentice, and tomorrow the next chapter of her life would truly begin. What would Marigolddust teach her first? Would the territory be everything that she had hoped for? Was the lake really as big as the other apprentices said it was? As usual, her mind was reeling. Ever since Icestar had called her name from upon the Highledge, Wrenpaw’s brain had gone into hyperdrive. So many emotions had overcome her at once, and she was still feeling the residual effects  of them now. She was thrilled that Marigolddust was her mentor, even though it had been obvious how nervous the responsibility made him. She was determined to make the job as easy as possible for the warrior, and be the best apprentice she could be. Of course, that’s how every apprentice was, right? 

Dark amber gaze traveled around the clearing to her few clanmates that were still awake, falling upon Viperpaw. She certainly didn’t look very enthused for someone who’d just been apprenticed, and Wrenpaw wondered why. She knew that Viperpaw had been a notoriously cranky kitten, but surely the apprentice ceremony would have made her happy? Naturally, Wrenpaw was concerned and felt obligated to help the other cat, even if they weren’t friends, and began to head towards the dark furred molly. 

Her tone was as cheerful and sweet as usual as she greeted her den mate. <strong>”Hey, Viperpaw! Mind if I join you?”</strong> She asked, standing a tail length or so away from the other she-cat. She wanted to ask what was wrong, but she knew it wasn’t polite to stick her nose into other cats business. She could only hope that maybe Viperpaw</span>

The familiar anxious feeling began to creep into Wrenpaw’s chest as she studied the other cats expression, feeling like maybe she was unwanted company. Of course it wasn’t her intention to bother Viperpaw, but she felt as if her presence wasn’t exactly what the other wanted. As much as Wrenpaw wanted to be friends with everyone, she wasn’t so sure if this friendship would be easily made.</span>

Unlike Wrenpaw, her mind wasn’t buzzing with thoughts about what Cinderblaze was going to teach her in their training sessions. She didn’t exactly care, she’d follow along, if only to just learn the essentials and then take them with her when she began her life as a rogue. Might as well take advantage of the “kindness” the clan was showing her in the meantime. It’ll help her for sure when she was out there, living her own life, bound by no code. No need to get all sentimental and befriend anyone either, it’d just complicate her plans. Even if it stung that her siblings seemed more and more attached to this place every single day, she would resist. She knew who she was, they wouldn’t take that from her, she was sure of it! <em>Still… I was hoping they’d want to come with me. They like it here, they actually call both the scarred cat and the dark-furred cat mother…</em> a small sigh escaped her lips as she relaxed her tensed up form, if she kept frowning like this, she’d develop tons of wrinkles prematurely. She didn’t need to age fifty moons before she even earned her warrior’s name.

<em>My warrior’s name? No no, it won’t even matter! No!</em>

She let out a loud groan as she swiped at the ground in frustration, leaving a small gash in the ground where she’d kicked up dust in it’s wake. In all her brooding, she’d nearly missed the greeting coming from the cat behind her. The black-tortoiseshell molly craned her neck and scrunched up her nose at the cat who’d approached her. Wrenpaw, one of the cats she’d been promoted with, just who even <em>was</em> she? Viperpaw tended to avoid the others like the plague, unless they were her siblings, so she didn’t know her very well at all. <strong>”What do you want, Wrenpaw?”</strong> she huffed, her fur still slightly bristling from her fit of frustration. It appeared she’d attracted an audience, one that was <em>not</em> welcome. <strong>”I’m kinda in the middle of something, do you mind?”</strong> she clenched her teeth as she waved her away with her paw, immediately being dismissive. She was a tough nut to crack, it’d take a lot to try and melt her  icy exterior. She’d walled herself off long ago.

The young apprentice felt relieved when he said her rambling hadn’t bothered him, and he seemed to mean it too. She only hoped that with how much time they’d be spending together from here on out that those feelings wouldn’t change. Although, Wrenpaw was sure that she would get better at the whole talking thing. And perhaps as she continued to grow and mature, she would be less overly excitable, too. Just maybe. She knew that eventually, bouncing around and fidgeting wouldn’t be appropriate for her age anymore. Sure, Marigolddust didn’t mind now, but she was still just a kitten - an apprentice for mere minutes. What if they were practicing hunting, and she got so excited over the sight of prey that she scared it off? Or, what if she rambled on so loudly or for so long about something that she scared all the prey in the forest off? What if she did that while on a patrol? How embarrassing that would be for Marigolddust. No way, she could never allow herself to embarrass him. She would just have to try to be better, calmer. Forcing her over thinking brain to slow down, Wrenpaw took a deep breath and waited for whatever else her new mentor would have to say to her. 

Her troubled thoughts seemed to fly away like a bird when he mentioned setting up a nest, and a smile returned to her face. <strong>”Nope! I don’t know how to do that. It’s a good thing I learn now, too, because soon I’ll be changing the nests in the elders den and I’ll want to know how to do it right. I’ve heard that they can be <em>really</em> cranky if you don’t do it right,”</strong> she said sincerely. Wrenpaw was excited to start serving her clan. As a kitten she spent a lot of time playing, as most kits did, but she also spent a lot of time observing. She knew a lot of what was expected from the apprentices, and she was ready to take on those tasks for herself. It was hard for her not to think of everything that she had to learn</span>

Right now, she could just focus on learning how to set up a nest in her new den. Everything else would come later, and she could focus on them as they came. <strong>”I know we need moss!”</strong> That much was obvious. 

She pondered his words, still feeling worried about sharing a den with so many new faces. It wasn’t so much the apprentices her age that made her nervous, but the older ones. Would they make fun of her? She wasn’t so fond of the idea of training in front of them. She supposed she would have to get used to that, though. Besides, she wasn’t the only new apprentice. And Marigolddust was right, she did have friends with her, and she would probably make more. <strong>”You’re right. It’s nice to have some of my friends from the nursery in the apprentices den with me.”</strong> Wrenpaw agreed. She gave a soft giggle, tail sweeping back and forth. <strong>”So, how bout that nest?”</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The once-grey skies of dawn had, as time went on, slowly began to morph into a brighter and bluer atmosphere. The sun was starting to creep out from behind the horizon, her rays already shedding light onto the once-bleak camp. It was lovely, she thought, how mere hours can bring about such change. One thing had always remained a constant, however: her inability to sleep. Whenever she was left alone for a period of time, that’s all she would dwell on. She couldn’t help it! What else was she supposed to think about besides the shadow monsters that had haunted her in her sleep? There was one time, though, that they had even followed her into her waking hours. She saw them out of the corner of her peripheral every single time and it was beyond terrifying. They weren’t just one off things, no, they were terrifyingly consistent and they wouldn’t stop even if she asked them politely to. All they would do was laugh in her face and call it a day. What would you do if that happened to you? That thought lingered helplessly in her mind. Why <em>did</em> it happen to her?

She was sure any cat from any distance away could notice the tiredness that hung from her eyelids that threatened to tear them down. StarClan, at this point, it was probably harder <em>not</em> to notice. She had gotten a multitude of comments on it - more than she had quite bargained for, to say the least, and every single time it was the same answer: ‘I didn’t sleep well last night.’ She wouldn’t tell anyone the real reason why, of course, for fear that they would only brush it off and laugh at her. She stationed herself outside of the warrior’s den, her blue/red eyes closed the slightest bit. Not asleep, no, but simply resting for the time being.

She was well-acquainted with sleepless nights, hounded by incessant nightmares that plagued her subconscious. While she’d been having peaceful rests as of late, she always wondered whether it’d suddenly change. She’d been terrorized in her sleep before, by forces she knew well, but she’d been focusing on closing out her mind to them. It seemed to be working, as she hadn’t encountered Silentwing in the Dark Forest in some time, but perhaps that was just because the wraith wasn’t looking to toy with her then. She probably had other nefarious plans, ones that didn’t include infiltrating her dreams and trying to attack her. Laurelblaze was always in a perpetual state of fear when she laid down in her nest at night, even if she did not outwardly show it.

Thankfully, because of the past few moons being rather uneventful in terms of restful nights and waking up <em>alive</em>, she’d been able to return to some sense of normalcy. Getting up early to conduct her business as deputy of ThunderClan, trying to assist her clanmates in any way she could. She adored them all, and they brought solace to her. Serving these cats was the greatest honor bestowed upon her, even when she was just promoted to a mere warrior. She always loved her clan, and the fulfillment at seeing all her hard work pay off. Even if it wasn’t fully appreciated by some, she still kept at it. Hence why she was up so early, practically at the crack of dawn. What she hadn’t expected to see was another face, typically her clanmates tended to sleep in at least a little while longer before getting up. Was this another eager soul seeking to get started with the day? Or was it mere restlessness? She’d find out soon enough, it was easy to tell whether someone was tired or not by mere looks. <strong>”Blurryowl?”</strong> she’d approached her clanmate with a gentle greeting, inspecting her for a moment. By the way the young warrior was struggling to keep her eyes open even for a moment already gave the deputy her answer, was she just not a morning person though? <strong>”Are you alright? Do you need anything?”</strong> sure, there really wasn’t much to cure a case of drowsiness aside from dunking someone’s head into a pool of ice-cold water for them, but since it was greenleaf, they were fresh out of luck there.

The ginger and white she-cat stood awkwardly at her heels once most of the cats began to disperse from the clearing, watching as her siblings scurried off to one of the dens or followed after their mentors tails. The voice of another molly caused her paws to hop for a moment off the ground in a swift flinch, shooting her widened gaze towards the brown tabby apprentice and examined this other Tigerpaw in the up and down motion with her startled gaze. <strong>&quot;Tigerpaw—? But I&#39;m Tigerpaw! How...&quot;</strong> She eyed the young molly in confusion, how in the world can there be two Tigerpaws?! What was in Icestars mind when naming them?! <strong>&quot;A— S,, sure. I guess...&quot;</strong> Tigerpaw sighed, optics lingering down to her shuffling paws as the tip of her tail gave out a small flick. <strong>&quot;W- what den,, though?&quot;</strong> She inquired quietly, slowly tilting her vague gaze back up to the other Tigerpaws level. Tigerpaw herself was never really familiar with Thunderclans denning system, it just seemed so weird and strict! And... Scary, Icestar was scary too, and don&#39;t even get her started on Laurelblaze—</span>

Marigolddust felt content with not minding Wrenpaw&#39;s enjoyment in conversating.  It kept a conversation afloat, especially for a warrior like Marigolddust, who, for one, was very bad at speaking.  She was a good cat, anyhow, and was caring.  That was more than could be said for apprentices like Truthpaw.  It was a relief that he ended up with such a friendly apprentice over a more rude or snappy one, although it only elevated the anxiety he had about ruining her life with poor teachings.  Not only would that be bad, but he would disgrace Icestar and Skycloud if he did terribly.  Taking in a deep breath and exhaling, he tried to relax himself and his mind alike.  He was supposed to be calm, and how could he mess up today, anyways?  All they would have to do was set up a new nest for Wrenpaw.  Perhaps the placement of the nest would be something that he should worry about, although he knew how he could fix that.  As long as nobody else had taken it, he felt that it might be alright to put Wrenpaw&#39;s nest where he once had his, and where Rooksnap had her&#39;s before him.  That seemed like a decent place, right?  As long as Wrenpaw agreed with it they might do it, although he hoped Rooksnap wouldn&#39;t mind at all.  The last thing he wanted was to push her recently thin patience.  

            Listening intently to what Wrenpaw said, he could help but shiver at the mention of the elders.  Elders like Lilacdew were the nice ones who would share a story to kits at any given time, but she had joined Starclan, leaving the clan with two elders total, and he knew one of them.  Batears wasn&#39;t a cat he felt excited to meet again.  The large-eared, raven colored elder was the most cranky creature he had ever laid eyes on.  Hopefully he wouldn&#39;t give Wrenpaw too much trouble.</span>

            <em><strong><em>&quot;That&#39;s true; some of them aren&#39;t the most patient, although they&#39;ll deal.  You&#39;ll be an expert by the time you help them with their nests, anyways.&quot;</em></strong></em> He said with a smile.  <em><strong><em>&quot;We *do</em> need moss,&quot;*</strong></em> he agreed, pausing for a moment to try and decide how they should approach the project.  Skycloud had gone out into the territory to gather moss herself while Marigolddust, or Marigold<em>paw</em> cat the time, stayed behind and waited.  But he had been, and might still be, scared of the outside world.  Unlike he had been, Wrenpaw seemed excited to explore the forest.  

            <em>Your right.</em>. Well, that was a good start, even if it was only because of such a small statement.  All he had to do was prevent doing the opposite and messing up.  No pressure, though- surely he could figure it out?  Dragging his mind away from the distracting topic, he focused again on the topic of Wrenpaw&#39;s nest.  <em><strong><em>&quot;We just need to collect some moss from the territory and bring it back here.  Or just I can, if you don&#39;t want to,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, not wanting to make Wrenpaw think she&#39;d have to come along with him, although he would prefer it.  There were many dangers in the forest any time of the day, but at such a late hour he felt it would be even more dangerous.  He had to hold back a gulp as he waited for his new apprentice&#39;s answer.</span>

<em>What do you want, Wrenpaw?</em> The hostility of the words and the bristling of Viperpaw’s fur sent Wrenpaw’s ears back to her skull, and her tail drooped behind her. Certainly not the response she was expecting, or hoping for from the other apprentice. Though she always held some anxiety when approaching any cat, it usually went well for her. Tonight was different, however. The caramel furred molly suddenly realized that she didn’t know how to even respond to such hostility, as she had never encountered it before. <strong>”Uh, I-I’m sorry, I just thought… I thought you looked like you could use some company,”</strong> she stammered. Her amber gaze flicked from Viperpaw to the ground and back again, finding it hard to meet the she-cats gaze for longer than a moment. She didn’t understand how anyone could be so cranky after becoming an apprentice. It was supposed to be an exciting thing, wasn’t it? 

As usual in any situation, Wrenpaw felt obligated to help. A smarter apprentice would have apologized for the intrusion and walked away, but not Wrenpaw. She wanted to make the other apprentice less upset somehow, even if she didn’t know how. There must be something she could do, right? <strong>”Maybe I can help! I-I don’t want to bother you but… nobody should be so upset after their apprentice ceremony. Are you unhappy with your mentor?”</strong> As clueless as Wrenpaw could be, that seemed like the most obvious issue. Just because she had been so lucky with the mentor that she wanted didn’t mean the other apprentices would be pleased with their own.  (I’m sorry this took me so long ;-; )</span>

A typical extension of kindness coming from a stranger, an attempt to get on her good side and become “friends”. She didn’t <em>need</em> to be friends with these cats, but if she were to ward off suspicion of her becoming a flight risk around the others, she needed to play along. That didn’t mean she had to be friends with just anyone, however, but Wrenpaw seemed to be the type to stay in her own lane. She respected that, but she wasn’t looking to get all amiable and buddy-buddy with her. Viperpaw didn’t know if she even had the capacity to be all cheerful and giddy like some of the others, the thought made her sick to her stomach. <strong>”No, Cinderblaze is a fine enough mentor. I’m mostly just upset my brother had to drag me up to the Highledge and embarrass me in front of everyone. I was taking my time.”</strong> a half-truth, she wasn’t going to reveal her distaste for this clan and almost everyone within it’s walls. She was going to make Featherpaw pay later on for this transgression against her. <em>Mark my words, he will face my wrath for that public humiliation!</em> she inwardly cackled, and she was almost tempted to grin wickedly at the thought. She might end up weirding out Wrenpaw, though, she didn’t need to set that as her reputation amongst the other apprentices. Viperpaw was going to show them all just who she was in the short time she was going to remain here. This clan couldn’t contain her forever! <strong>”I appreciate your offer, but nothing you can do right now can help me. Besides, do you really want to spend your time helping strangers out with impossible problems when you could be hanging out with your friends?”</strong> she flicked a tufted ear as she turned back towards the caramel-colored molly, narrowing her crystal-like gaze as she inspected her carefully. She knew this cat was somewhat liked amongst their peers, why would she select <em>her</em> of all cats to talk to when she was buddies with one of the leader’s sons? Even if Viperpaw was considered the deputy’s “daughter” along with being a senior warrior’s “kit”, she didn’t consider Laurelblaze and Hollyfrost her parents… Even if she did owe much of her survival to them. Her siblings seemed fond of them, so she stayed mum, but she was conflicted about how to feel about them, they were her guardians here, but she didn’t know whether to address them as her parents.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As much as she’d hate to admit it, this had always been her normal - though, the nightmares had seemed to increase in intensity as she had gotten older. When they had first come to her, they had been little things, barely anything to worry about. But now they were a huge fiasco every single time she fell asleep. There was, unfortunately, not a night she could remember where she had been graced with a pleasant dream. They were always there. Always watching her. Even now, in a somnolent state, they were there. She was awake and yet they were still there. She didn’t know why. What did they want from her? She couldn’t put a finger on it. Would they haunt her forever? Stars, she hoped not. 

The deputy’s voice roused her to open her eyes, a smile crossing over her lips as she saw who was approaching her. The two of them had talked once before, she knew, and so she supposed a little more interaction wouldn’t hurt. Besides, being on the deputy’s good side is always a good idea, isn’t it? Of course. Shaking the languor from her gaze and also from the cobwebs of her mind, she took a moment to think over Laurelblaze’s question. Was she alright? Well, in a way, yes, she was - the feeling of being alright was in itself a natural state of existence. Now onto the other question: did she need anything? That question was a little bit more on the complex side - how in the world could she say that she didn’t want to be haunted by nightmares anymore? That was a little bit outlandish. And also probably crazy if she said it to just anyone. <em><strong>”Oh, Laurelblaze,”</strong></em> her voice was soft and as smooth as it always had been, a pleasant thing. <em><strong>”I. . . am about as alright as one can expect, you know,”</strong></em> she raised a paw to gesture to her face and just how tired she looked. <em><strong>”But, of course, the same could be asked of you. How are you doing? How have things been? I would hope everything has been good since we’ve last spoke,”</strong></em> a smile broke along the crease of her lips as she blinked slowly.

It seemed her clanmate was also acutely aware of her exhausted state, something that made the deputy feel a shred of pity for her. Sleep was a gift to them all, they all deserved to rest properly and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the next day’s challenges. <strong>”I’m doing well, I’m used to getting up at these hours and getting to work,”</strong> truly, the tortoiseshell felt well-rested and energized, though she never had a low supply of that precious commodity. The deputy could take on the world and grapple with it to no end if she could, even she was bound to need rest here and there. <strong>”I have to ask, are you feeling all right? Should I go get Fernpaw to check you out or get you some herbs? You look as if you rose from the dead, no offense.”</strong> she frowned lightly as she inspected the tired femora’s features yet again. It was her job to ensure her clanmates were fit for duty, she couldn’t send exhausted warriors out into the forest and risk their lives. Going out into the forest while running on little to no sleep was dangerous, it meant her senses would be limited and her attention might drift to other places. It was risky, and left them vulnerable to ambush. 

Then, a disturbing thought came to mind. Was Blurryowl being terrorized by enemies in the Dark Forest by any chance? Could that have been the reason for her sleeping problems? <strong>”Are you having trouble sleeping by any chance? Dreams of a forest enshrouded in shadow? Did you see anyone in it if you have?”</strong> she had to ask, because if a Dark Forest warrior was going around and tormenting her clanmates, that was an issue. She needed to make sure they were all safe and protected.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The young molly nodded as Viperpaw explained her reasons for being so upset. Granted, Wrenpaw had no understanding what it was like to be embarrassed by a sibling because she didn’t have any, but that didn’t mean she couldn’t try. <strong>”Well, he probably shouldn’t have done that. Everyone has probably forgotten about it by now, anyways. I didn’t even notice, if that helps. Then again, I don’t notice a lot of things,”</strong> she added with a light chuckle. It seemed to Wrenpaw that Viperpaw wasn’t happy to become an apprentice at all. She found it hard to believe that the actions of her brother had ruined the whole night for her, and assumed that there was something deeper. However, that was none of her business. And frankly, she was too scared to ask. Viperpaw intimidated her, and she certainly wasn’t about to push any boundaries. 

Maybe Viperpaw was right. Perhaps there was nothing that Wrenpaw could do to help, but it wouldn’t stop her from trying. She had a pretty good track record for helping other cats with things. Friends are supposed to help each other, right? Although she and Viperpaw weren’t friends, they were still clanmates and Wrenpaw would always help her fellow clanmates. Who knew, maybe one day the two she-cats would be friends. Amber eyes flicked over to the other apprentices across the clearing, all smiling and chatting amongst themselves. She shrugged, returning her gave to Viperpaw. <strong>”Yes, I’d rather help you, or try to I guess. They’re having fun without me, they don’t need me. I-I mean you don’t <em>need</em> me either, I just mean you seemed like you could use some company more than them right now.</strong>” Wrenpaw tried not to visibly wince at her own words, genuinely nervous that she’d said the wrong thing. She didn’t want to make Viperpaw feel like some sort of basket case. <strong>”We get to see the tenure territory tomorrow, and the borders with the other clans. That’s something to look forward to, hm?”</strong> She asked, changing the subject. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

It had rained overnight, as indicated by the telltale scent of fresh rain against the soil. Patches of green grass that grew in select areas of camp drooped lower with condensed drops of water clinging to their blades as if it were the dew of early leaf-fall. The rainclouds had mostly moved on from this place, but the deputy could make out a few silvery-toned remnants that had not caught up with the rest of the pack. She didn’t hear thunder last night, much to her chagrin, it was just a rainy night. Laurelblaze always looked forward to watching lightning flashes at night, wondering where they were going to strike next from the relative safety of her nest in the warrior’s den. 

Now, it was all mucky and wet outside, and the evaporating water vapor felt as if it was clinging to her pelt as she stepped out into the sun. One aftereffect she loathed about the storms, the humidity. Letting out a small sigh, the gargantuan she-cat glanced towards the camp entrance. She’d done her rounds and inspected nests, ensuring everyone was accounted for during the night. Now it was practically midday, and here she was in camp. How dreadfully boring, she should have joined the morning hunting patrols. <em>Maybe tomorrow, or I’ll send out another past sun-high…</em> she often compromised with herself, putting off doing one thing for another, yet today she was just stuck in camp, awaiting her patrols to return or for her apprentices to actually get out of their nests. StarClan forbid she have pupils that were morning people for once. The deputy hated idling.

Amber eyes peered into the clearing from the camp&#39;s entrance, flickering about for a few moments as they thoroughly searched the area. Whiskers quivering, the tortoiseshell hobbled into the camp, a bird clamped between her jaws as she awkwardly made her way toward the fresh-kill pile. The occasional <em>slop</em> was heard whenever her paws hit a rather muddy area, which was highly unpleasant to the tortoiseshell. Unfortunately, due to her being a tad short, she wasn&#39;t exactly able to see where she needed to step to avoid them, she wouldn&#39;t want to seem troubled anyway.
    Traveling more by scent than sight, the apprentice eventually found the fresh-kill pile, dropping her prey upon it with an audible breath. Shaking off her paws a bit, the apprentice turned to gaze over her fellow clanmates for a moment, most of which were already busy with other things. Glancing skyward, she noticed the time. Stars, she&#39;d been gone for quite awhile. Or perhaps not, the morning patrols hadn&#39;t even returned yet. If only she&#39;d caught them in time, surely she&#39;d have something to do other than her current activity, which was to be bored out of her mind.
    Letting her gaze roam the area, she spotted a familiar figure among the various felines. The deputy! Perfect, she&#39;d probably love to hear about what she&#39;d done, she&#39;d been such a good clanmate today, others had to be proud of her. Striding over to her, the small molly held her head high, tapping on the larger feline&#39;s leg with a paw. <strong>&quot;Greetings, deputy! I&#39;m happy to report I&#39;ve brought back a really big bird for the clan this morning! I hope such pleases you.&quot;</strong> She said to her proudly, tail swaying. Truth be told, it wasn&#39;t big, only big for her. <strong>&quot;Is there anything else you&#39;d like me to handle, deputy?&quot;</strong> She inquired after a moment, putting on her most serious expression.

She made it a habit to get to know her clanmates on at least a first-name basis if she hadn&#39;t really spoken with them aside from the occasional organization of patrols or routine head-counts of hers. The apprentice who&#39;d approached her was none other than Kindlepaw, not one of her own apprentices, nor a distant relative of her family... She thought so anyways. There were so many cats she was related to through adoption and blood in this clan that it made it a serious challenge for her to keep up with it all. Though the deputy was positive this cat was just a clanmate, it wasn&#39;t like her father could keep adopting kits from beyond the grave. If he was, she&#39;d have to give him some credit, he was a dedicated and doting parent.

<em>He probably would try to do that if it were possible.</em>

She glanced downwards to the younger tortoiseshell and gave her a small smile, slightly lopsided and goofy looking with her minor underbite that left one of her lower canines poking out from her lip. This apprentice was addressing her as &quot;deputy&quot; rather than her name like everyone else normally would. Why she was being so formal about it was odd, and she would think they would at least call her &quot;deputy Laurelblaze&quot;, but that even seemed like a mouthful. <strong>&quot;Hey Kindlepaw.&quot;</strong> she greeted the young molly with a sway of her tail, before her heterochromatic gaze drifted towards the large bird she&#39;d caught earlier. <strong>&quot;Nice catch, at this rate I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll ace that portion of your warrior&#39;s assessment, granted if your mentor even includes it in it.&quot;</strong> she complimented the haul with nothing but pure integrity, she would not undermine an apprentice&#39;s accomplishments to their face, or ever. Laurelblaze was not cruel the youth of her clan, they very much made her proud to serve them. <strong>&quot;Not at this moment, no, perhaps later on though... But uh... Why do you keep addressing me as deputy? Why not my name?&quot;</strong> she had to address this minor elephant in the room. While she appreciated the fact the apprentice was showing her respect for her rank, but there came a time where it felt as if she was addressing her like she was some untouchable, divine being whose name you could never speak of or something. It felt off-putting for some reason.

<em>I hope it isn&#39;t like this when I&#39;m leader... StarClan forbid, make some of them insubordinate but not too much!</em>

Despite her impressive size and scars, Thunderclan&#39;s deputy hardly seemed very intimidating among her clanmates, at least, that&#39;s how Kindlepaw saw it. She couldn&#39;t imagine a clan having a deputy that scared their own clanmates, how would anything get done if such was the case? <em>Or maybe I&#39;m just different. I&#39;m not afraid of anything anyway, I&#39;d make a great deputy myself one day.</em> She thought to herself, glancing toward the perch where Icestar would normally be positioned when addressing the clan for important matters. That would be Laurelblaze one day. Maybe even herself, but that would be generations from now. Way too much to think about. She&#39;d leave the deputy stuff to Thunderclan&#39;s current deputy for now.
    She grinned at the larger feline&#39;s reply, glad to be assured she&#39;d done quite well. <strong>&quot;Thank you!&quot;</strong> She replied with a dip of her head, whiskers quivering slightly. Ah yes, that would be something she could handle. Her warrior assessment. And warriorhood. Of course, it would be a couple of more moons before that happened, but she was practically a warrior already, leaving early to hunt and even return with prey! Most of the time anyway. If she didn&#39;t sleep in some days. Even so, she was already proving herself to be a reliable clanmate no doubt!
    Unfortunately, Laurelblaze had no tasks for her to take on, much to her disappointment. At the deputy&#39;s inquiry, the tortoiseshell looked surprised, amber eyes blinking. <strong>&quot;Isn&#39;t that how others normally address you? You don&#39;t go by your rank? That doesn&#39;t seem very cool of you.&quot;</strong> She replied, wrinkling her nose at the idea. If she was deputy, she wouldn&#39;t want to be addressed as Kindlewhatever, but &#39;deputy.&#39; It had such a nice ring to it after all. <strong>&quot;Is that a problem? You don&#39;t like being formally addressed? Why not?&quot;</strong> She asked. Perhaps there was a reason behind it.

Things hadn&#39;t been the same in ThunderClan lately.

Everyone could tell that Rooksnap wasn&#39;t her usual self. She&#39;d been distant and moody for moons, and worst of all it affected her many adopted kits. The group of them huddled together sharing fresh kill and tongues in the dying light of greenleaf sunset, but their stout chocolate nanny lay off to the side, hunching over a hardly tasted mouse alone.

Turned away, it was hard to discern her expression, but easy to guess. She could feel their concerned glances every once in a while. They hadn&#39;t bothered her though, not for a long time.

Until now. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span> <span class="mention" title="cake#9694">@cake</span> <span class="mention" title="Coywolffe#0013">@Sleepy Old Man Coy (He/Him)™</span> <span class="mention" title="northern foxy#8613">@spark&#39;s clone™</span></span>

While she had never been quite the same after Kestrelpaw&#39;s leave, the chocolate femme seemed to be back to herself, more or so. Soft beige paws lay slanted on the floor, her body following it as teeth were gnawing on a squirrel. 

Violet eyes set steadily ahead like there wasn&#39;t some looming shadow behind her, she forced herself to have a good time, even offering the slightest of smile at a jest made her way. 

Until finally, she turned back, lip curling briefly - however she tried to convince herself that she could do just well without Rooksnap, part of her missed when she was a kit and they had all the fun in the world.

<strong>&quot;You think she&#39;s alright?&quot;</strong> the inquiry was left out in the open, quiet as if trying to ponder with herself but loud enough for everyone in the surrounding proximity to hear her.</span>

Marigolddust wasn&#39;t all too used to small gatherings like this one, even though he had gone through something very similar as an apprentice.  The only difference was that the first picnic had Rooksnap there, as she had been the one who started it, and now she was one of the only ones absent.  This realization stuck to the tux&#39;s mind the whole time he sat there with the others in the group, eating his small sparrow.  More than just a little bit of words had managed to be formed on his tongue, as the tom was too sucked up into thought and anxiety over the whole matter.  He kept his gaze away from her, hoping that she wouldn&#39;t notice too much of his attention, but couldn&#39;t help but fiddle with his paws as he ate.  

            Some relief washed over him as Marbledpaw voiced her concern for Rooksnap, although it also made him tense some.  Had everybody noticed?  Had others been looking?  Was it too clear that they were thinking, talking, and pondering over the deep brown munchkin stationed away from them?  He remembered when he was a kit, and apprentice, before Beetlestreak died, and how much he loved hanging out with Rooksnap and Fernpaw.  Rooksnap had even been more of a mother to him than his own mother, but now it seemed that actions were being repeated.  <em>Distant, neglective, and mysterious... all caused by a single cat&#39;s death.</em>  It sounded exactly like what happened to his mother, and now it was too late to try and fix the blue tortoiseshell&#39;s mistakes for her.  But that wouldn&#39;t happen to Rooksnap, would it?  No, she would get over it and get better, and then things could go back to what it used to be.  he would never let it happen, either.  Every fur on his flank wanted to go over and try and convince her to join them.  It couldn&#39;t be that hard, could it?</span>

             Biting his lip for just a moment as he pondered over what he should do, his tail flinched from one side to the other before he looked back to Marbledpaw.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I... I&#39;m not sure... should I go over and check on her?  Maybe she&#39;ll join us?&quot;</em></strong></em> he suggested, wanting eagerly for Rooksnap to go back to as she was when he was a kit.  He missed that Rooksnap, and wanted to see her again as soon as possible.</span>

Though she was his friend, he didn&#39;t exactly like to approach others, and would much rather continue on his routine. So, if she didn&#39;t come to him, he wasn&#39;t going to come to her. Either way, he noticed how.. distant she looked. Isolated away from the rest of the clan. He didn&#39;t feel like disturbing her if she didn&#39;t want to be.

He turned towards the fresh-kill pile and snatched a shrew. A small break could be taken before he went back out, surely. Jayfang walked towards a section of camp with no other cats, but as he walked by, he overheard Marigolddust. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t give it a shot,&quot; he cut in, forgetting he wasn&#39;t intended to be a part of the conversation. &quot;She seems like she wants to be alone.&quot;

The young tom huffed as he looked towards Rooksnap, his ear twitching as he swallowed down his bite, he had still been bitter over his and his sibling&#39;s abandonment. &quot;She&#39;s probably fine.&quot; He said, rushing his tongue along his jaws as he watched the others, despite his words concern gleamed in his gaze.

Spending time with her little makeshift family seemed good enough; even though there was always the constant fear her and her brother would be left in the dust and ever since Shallow’s passing, Clover had only fallen deeper into the dark hole that consumed her. 

“<strong>I wouldn’t worry too much about it, Marbled. She gets distanced.</strong>” The black and white molly was gingerly cleaning her paws after finishing her own meal, but she faltered to look up at Rooksnap with an unreadable gaze. Was it happening again? <em>Adults just start getting distant..</em> 

When Marigolddust spoke though, there was a bit of a worked gaze that tended to show when none of the others were looking. Oddly enough, Cloverpaw did see Rooksnap as a mother figure - whether it be a decent one or not. And lately, she had been showing the same signs of her and Blaze’s past two guardians.. who both left them. “<strong>I thought for sure she’d be hungry, though..</strong>” the voice came it in a barely audible raspy whisper.

She stared at Rooksnap for several seconds longer before nodding along with the comment from the other apprentice. At Marigolddust&#39;s statement, though, her fur fluffed up,,

<strong>&quot;No.&quot;</strong>

While the others voiced their concerns and dissent, hers was a demand, ringing clear with soft dislike in her voice; to her, it was up to the brown molly to fix things, not the other way around. It wasn&#39;t really that Rooksnap had missed her ceremony and never even apologized for it, though she was still a little upset from that - it was how she talked about Kestrelpaw&#39;s leaving with the bitterness in her voice, and the calico grew naturally defensive. Kes was <em>her</em> sister, and she did whatever she wanted to, and never because some warrior didn&#39;t like it. She hadn&#39;t talked with her nanny several moons now - and intended to keep it that way. She was concerned, yes, but not enough to subject herself to whatever the other was feeling.

<strong>&quot;You can go talk to her. Don&#39;t involve me, though,&quot;</strong> a tuck of her paws tightly to her flank, staring upwards challengingly even though it was herself that suggested if she was alright in the first place.</span>

Hearing the comments of the others, including a passing-by Jayfang, didn&#39;t give Margolddust much courage.  None of them seemed to think it wasn&#39;t a good idea to go over and try to talk to the molly, but he felt inclined to.  She was always there to invite him to have a bite before, anyhow, so why shouldn&#39;t he do the same for her?  Maybe it would make her feel better, and help her progress through whatever she was going through a bit easier.  What would the others think, though?  They all advised against it, but he could see the concern displayed on some of their features.  He thought again over what Jayfang had said.  <em>She seems like she wants to be alone.</em>  Perhaps he <em>should</em> just leave her be.  He didn&#39;t want to be a bother, anyways.  But... it was challenging keeping himself from approaching the older warrior and trying to give her some comfort that she may or may not need.  

               In the end, he decided to just listen to one statement, even if that statement wasn&#39;t directing him to do anything.  So, he wouldn&#39;t involve Marbledpaw.  That should be easy, right?  He just had to invite Rooksnap over, have Rooksnap sit farther away from the marble-pelted apprentice, and it would all go smoothly.  It seemed like it was best for all of them if he invited the nanny over to eat, and nothing much seemed to be at risk.  It was just an offer, and besides Jayfang he was the only warrior here.  It seemed like it might have been under the many jobs a warrior had, taking charge and trying to help others who could be in need.  <em>Unless she&#39;s not in need</em>, he reminded himself.  But, even with the reminder, he nodded to Marbledpaw and stood, carefully padding up to Rooksnap.</span>

               A small smile crossed the ashy warrior&#39;s muzzle as he came up to Rooksnap.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Hey, Rooksnap, I was... uh, wondering if you&#39;d like to come over and join us?  We could always use some more cats to talk to,&quot;</em></strong></em> he offered, clawing softly at the loos soil underfoot in an attempt to fight off the anxiety that was slowly rising inside his chest.  What if she said no?  What if she got upset?  What if it was a mistake coming over here and inquiring that she could come over?  Stepping firmly on his own tail, he brought himself back to focus.  All he had to do was wait for an answer, and either bring her over or go back without her.  That was a good plan, wasn&#39;t it?  Oh, he sure hoped so.</span>

Jayfang settled on the ground, slightly further away than the rest of them, but close enough to seem part of the group. It was too late to get him to leave now. He took a bite of the shrew as Marigolddust seemed to be lost in thought, saying nothing as he looked at the rest of the group. 

Then Marigolddust seemed to make a decision, and stood up. He watched as the other warrior walked over towards Rooksnap. &quot;Wow. He&#39;s actually going over there,&quot; Jayfang remarked. Despite being basically an outsider, as he didn&#39;t know most of the cats here very well, he felt comfortable enough to talk. &quot;Even though we all said he shouldn&#39;t.&quot; He wore an expression of boredom, and his voice was rather monotonous. It seemed he really didn&#39;t care all that much.

Blaze glanced at Clover for a moment as he moved to rest his flank against hers protectively, speaking quietly. &quot;No matter what we have each other.&quot; He licked her ear before returning to his meal. &quot;He&#39;s just wasting his time...&quot; 

<em>All adults are the same.</em> he thought to himself bitterly. He had started to relax and bond a bit with Rooksnap until she began distancing herself from her clowder of adopted kits- causing the torbie tom to close off again.</span>

It was sad, the way she&#39;d dissociated so drastically. Her kits depended on her.

She was so young to be acting like a grumpy old badger. Rooksnap lived up to her name, sure, but the motherly talent she had was undeniable. In her time as a warrior she&#39;d created her own mismatched family of sorts. She had empathy for them as an orphan herself. A quilt of misfits brought together under one wing.

But what happened when that wing faltered? Beetlestreak&#39;s death had obviously perturbed her, and Shallow&#39;s had shaken her up, not to mention Kestrelpaw&#39;s leave. Perhaps she had grown up too fast.

A shadow spliced the orange light, rendering Rooksnap&#39;s warm chocolate fluff a darker, more sinister henna. Then a voice drifted down to her, inviting and gentle. She didn&#39;t look up, nor behind her at the group. She knew who it was.

<strong>&quot;Go away, Marigolddust.&quot;</strong> She avoided the question with a firm but weary reply. A fly landed on her mouse, then took off again. She didn&#39;t even bother to bat it away. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span> <span class="mention" title="cake#9694">@cake</span> <span class="mention" title="Coywolffe#0013">@Sleepy Old Man Coy (He/Him)™</span> <span class="mention" title="northern foxy#8613">@spark&#39;s clone™</span> <span class="mention" title="-Swift-#3184">@-Jayfang-</span></span>

Hope had a way of convincing cats to do things without imagining the possible consequences that didn&#39;t satisfy it, and this was exactly what Marigolddust was experiencing.  He had more hope now than he has for awhile, and what better opportunity was there to fix things, even if just a little?  Plus, it was good to be polite.  

              <em>Go away?</em> Truthfully, the response was expected.  Hesitating, he tried to come up with how he would approach the firm request.  She just wanted to be left alone, and that was clear.  <em><strong><em>A-alright, I&#39;ll see you later, then?&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, waiting patiently for a reply.  As he waited, he took the time to look around, perhaps to distract himself from thinking too far ahead.  The sky had a grey pelt on today, with a thick blanket of clouds blocking out the majority of the sunlight, although there were still a few breaks in the cliuds where the sun&#39;s light leaked through.  A weak breeze caused the branches of the trees surrounding the camp to brush against one another, creating a whole song of its own.  The day was decently cool, and was a nice break from the heat of the new greenleaf season.</span>

                 Perhaps it was a mistake coming over and inviting Rooksnap to eat with him and the others that she had taken under her wing.  This thought resulted in him pausing, second guessing himself.  She had taken them under her wing.  Would it really be more enjoyable being alone than with cats you considered family?  From experience, Marigolddust felt this was false.  Raising a moon-lit paw, he moved to swat the fly off of Rooksnap&#39;s food until it flew off itself.  <em><strong><em>&quot;We wouldn&#39;t mind your company at all-&quot;</em></strong></em> <em>other than maybe Marbledpaw... And the majority of the others,</em> <em><strong><em>&quot;-so if it would make you feel better-?&quot;</em></strong></em> By now Marigolddust couldn&#39;t help but feel something was wrong.  She sounded quite clearly upset, whether it was because of him or not, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel the need to try and assist her any way he could.  Although, he knew he really should get back to his sparrow before too many flies bombarded it and made it their own meal. This would be the last attempt, he decided.</span>

She cut off the younger warrior’s attempt at friendliness when she lurched to her paws, lumbering forward menacingly.  It was hard not to be intimidated by her bear like paws and intense neon eyes. A shadow seemed to be permanently stuck over her eyes. <strong>”Are you deaf?”</strong>

The snap rang clearly throughout the camp, loud enough for all to hear. Marigolddust was in the spotlight now, and not a good one. She continued to go off as she walked him backwards. <strong>”I said go away. I don’t want to see you. You’re a warrior now - grow up!”</strong> <em>You don’t need me.

Marigolddust&#39;s trail of thought was interupted right besides his spoken sentence as Rooksnap finally got to her paws.  He only had a little time to take notice of how her claws had dug into the soft soil beneath her before she had stood, and the anger in her face took him by surprise.  Although he had grown a bit taller than Rooksnap by now, he felt just as if he was a kitten again, being scolded heavily by a parental figure.  A dark expression was displayed on the fem&#39;s face, and it did little good at making him feel any better than he did now.  Stiffening, he took a step back, and before long it had started a pattern of him walking backwards away from the older warrior.  He couldn&#39;t take his own bright gaze from that of Rooksnap&#39;s, and it took confidence on his part to speak.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I-im sorry, I didn&#39;t-&quot;</em></strong></em> he began, but soon he was once again interupted by the angered feline.  

               <em>Grow up.</em> That statement hadn&#39;t intruded on his mind to rouse insecurities for a few moons now, and it had been relieving.  Unfortunately, the statement coming from a cat he thought he was so close to made them come back tenfold.  He knew he wasn&#39;t as brave or confident as the majority of the warriors in Thunderclan, but that became only a small part of the situation.  He should have left her alone the first time he was refused.  Why hadn&#39;t he?  Why had he been rude enough to ask again when she made it clear she wanted him gone? This all would have been fine if he had just left her as she had wanted him to.  Even better, maybe.  Perhaps leaving her to think about it would have convinced her to come over in itself, but of course he had to step up and ruin it. <em>The other&#39;s were right. Of course they were,</em> he thought. Dread and shame caused his face to turn red and tears to gather at the brim of his eyes, yet to fall but still present nonetheless. Finally, he adverted his gaze, although he continued to try to stay a tail-length away from her as he backed up.</span>

Being addressed so formally by her own clanmates was something she never truly got used to. It was true that she expected them to show her the respect they would show any other deputy, though in the past there were a few cats who believed they had the right to be insubordinate towards her based on their own personal judgements against her character. Perceived “wrongs” she made against them, intentional or not, only fueled the fire it seemed. She did not try to incite resentment from her clanmates, but like any deputy or leader before her, there would always be cats who did not agree with her decisions. She was mostly concerned with the safety of the clan as a whole. Being brave and strong wasn’t all there was to being a deputy, and while this young apprentice’s ambition was admirable… She hoped that any striving for this position take into account just how much of a burden it was to take on, and that there was no shame in not accepting it. Not everyone was destined to reign over a clan, as it was a stressful, difficult role to play. That was why the higher ranks of any clan expected at least some modicum of respect from their clanmates around them, for many did not understand just how much work they were doing to keep the clan running.

<strong>”No, not really. Even if it’s from a cat outside of ThunderClan, but even then, I just prefer someone using my full name. Some cats here actually call me Laurel.”</strong> she wasn’t a very formal and professional type around her clanmates. She saw them everyday, she had friends and family here, why shouldn’t she be on a first-name basis with them. <strong>”I call Icestar by her name, not leader, or leader Icestar.”</strong> it was just a quick example, but it served her point. She did showcase the upmost respect for her leadership, but she liked to think she knew Icestar well enough at this point to be on friendly, casual terms with her. The lynx-point always was the type to be friendly towards her clanmates, as driven as she was. <strong>”Even for others outside of ThunderClan, I expect them to address me by name. Not necessarily my rank, especially considering I have no jurisdiction over them.”</strong> she wasn’t exactly friends with many cats outside of ThunderClan though, she knew her counterparts from the other clans and had spoken with a few leaders during the Gatherings she’d attended, but to say she was close with anyone outside of the clan? No. Her brother was the Healer for the Fallen Claws as she’d come to learn, though. <strong>”I do expect respect from everyone I speak to. When it comes to diplomatic discussions with others outside of ThunderClan, I try to show courtesy to them and behave as a deputy should.”</strong>

<em>It’s incredibly boring though, what I wouldn’t give to have a fun sparring match with some of the others. Now that would be insanely fun.</em>

<em>We wouldn&#39;t mind your company at all.</em> She coughed, once, twice, sharply, and it spitefully echoed across camp. Violet gaze pierced into the back of Marigolddust, and the apprentice hoped he would feel it.

She was just about to pity the warrior - he would never convince her to join them, until she heard the rebuke, flinching and ears angling backwards even though she wasn&#39;t the receiver of the barbed snarl herself. 

<strong>&quot;Hey!&quot;</strong> a furious hiss and she was on her paws, storming in front of Marigolddust with her lip curled and eyes swimming with uncertainty, but there was no backing down now. <strong>&quot;You don&#39;t get to tell him to <em>grow up</em>, you&#39;ve barely been here for the past few moons.&quot;</strong>

<em>I shouldn&#39;t have said that.</em> Immediately the thought crossed through in horror.

<strong>&quot;Not your fault,&quot;</strong> she muttered at Margiolddust, shoving him off to the side so he wouldn&#39;t be in direct proximity of the warrior, before turning back to stare at the two younger apprentices - Cloverpaw and Blazepaw would,, wouldn&#39;t they? <strong>&quot;You&#39;re backing me up, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</strong></span>

Hearing Rooksnap growl at Marigolddust was enough for Blaze as he stood up with a growl, the fur along his spine bristling. &quot;What is your <em><strong>Problem?!</strong></em>&quot; He said following after Marbledpaw. &quot;He was just trying to check on you.&quot; He bared his teeth swatting at Rooksnap&#39;s tail. 

&quot;You&#39;re the one acting like a kit here- abandoning the kits that <em>you</em> brought here. Even if they&#39;re a warrior they still care about you.&quot; He lashed his tail behind him. &quot;If anyone should grow up it&#39;s <em>you</em>&quot; He hissed again his golden gaze ice cold as he stared at Rooksnap, digging his claws into the dirt. &quot;What right do you have to just abandon us like this and shove us off like we&#39;re spoiled prey?&quot;  <span class="mention" title="cake#9694">@cake</span> <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span> <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span> <span class="mention" title="-Swift-#3184">@-Jayfang-</span> <span class="mention" title="northern foxy#8613">@spark&#39;s clone™</span></span>

Seeing as he finished eating, he was about to stand up and leave, but something caught his eye. Rooksnap seemed to be interacting with someone, albeit in a negative way. Regardless, the quarrel was intriguing enough for him to remain instead of leave. It wasn&#39;t like he was going to do anything, however. Marigolddust was essentially a stranger, and he <em>did</em> advise against approaching Rooksnap. Whatever happened next was not his problem.

But it seemed to be Marbledpaw&#39;s problem. He watched as she stormed over in defense of Marigolddust, and Blazepaw following. What a show, indeed! Jayfang did feel a tad strange, staying in place instead of helping the apprentices, but he felt no obligation to. Perhaps he should break up the dispute.. later.

She watched Blaze go off on their nanny with such pure anger, but Clover’s reaction was a little more tamed.. well, that was only if she wasn’t considering murder in the back of her mind. 

The scrawny she’s green grass gaze landed on Marigolddust as she stood beside him, tail lashing in the air. She was one to take fights more coolly than the average apprentice - but that wasn’t saying she wasn’t absolutely <em>livid</em> towards Rooksnap. The black and white femme took one deep breath and looked the muddied she-cat straight in the eye. “<strong>What crawled in your nest?</strong>” she said in a note collected tone, swallowing hard. “<strong>We’re your <em>stupid</em> family and you <em>chose</em> to take us in, and you treat us like this? Marigolddust is the best of us, you stupid ignorant mousebrain. If you want to take your anger out.. take it out on <em>me</em>.</strong>” Their was a venomous hiss hidden in her quiet voice. Protective, hmm.. As a kit who had been abandoned enough, she had learned that Rooksnap wasn’t worth the time she wasted. If she was just gonna leave anyways.

Rooksnap&#39;s stance grew more defensive as she found herself suddenly surrounded by a team of angry apprentices coming to Marigolddust&#39;s rescue. The timid gray warrior&#39;s spluttered apologies were lost in the ensuing chaos.

Toxic voices piling on top one another, Rooksnap&#39;s small husky-like ears hardly discerned each insult, but she got the gist. She glanced between each kit she had raised - or half raised in some cases - but her steely expression showed no signs of softness or overwhelming. They&#39;d gotten their fierceness from <em>her</em>, and Rooksnap was as stubborn as they came. Her face hardened with competition.

<strong>&quot;Remember who you&#39;re talking to,&quot;</strong> she snarled, hiss dripping with poison, eyeing Blaze in particular in that moment, reclaiming her authority. The arch of her back grew more extreme. She held her ground, bushed tail lashing slowly but with force, unaware of her good friend Jayfang watching her ugliness come through. Her paralyzing sun-and-moon gaze swept the crowd of kits again. <strong>&quot;What do you know about growing up?&quot;</strong> The unrelenting swiftness with which her childhood had been robbed of her flashed in her mind. <strong>&quot;At least you <em>have</em> someone, so don&#39;t act so special. If it weren&#39;t for me, you&#39;d be dead by now - I&#39;d keep my mouth shut.&quot;</strong>

Her cents on Blaze and Cloverpaw cast, she redirected her fire onto Marbledpaw, who stood at the front of the group, shielding her adoptive older brother from the infernal nanny. Mismatched eyes locked with violet ones. <strong>&quot;<em>You.</em>&quot;</strong> Rooksnap lifted her broad chin to look just slightly down upon the apprentice. <strong>&quot;I had more faith in you. Out of all your littermates, you&#39;re still here. I thought I raised you better, to show respect. What would Hazelhues think?&quot;</strong> <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span> <span class="mention" title="cake#9694">@cake</span> <span class="mention" title="Coywolffe#0013">@Sleepy Old Man Coy (He/Him)™</span> <span class="mention" title="northern foxy#8613">@spark&#39;s clone™</span> <span class="mention" title="-Swift-#3184">@-Jayfang-</span></span>

As Cloverpaw and Blazepaw took their rounds in throwing more than harsh comments her way, she found her tail gently curling around the warrior, assuring he would be alright. 

Her mouth opened for a snarky retort when the flaming eyes of her nanny settled on her, and... oh, she didn&#39;t. There was a time where she looked up to Rooksnap like she was some angel in the Dark Forest- after her mother left she was really the only cat she really relied on. The calico could remember trying to seek out her approval and attention desperately- and maybe even now, she did. Marbledpaw&#39;s ears flattened to the bottom of her skull at the words that pierced itself in flawlessly, lip trembling, lavenders trying desperately to look away but feeling the stare on the back of her head nonetheless, paws frozen still on the ground. Did she really.. disappoint her that much?

<em><strong>&quot;You have no right to bring up my mom!&quot;</strong></em>

A snarl, tear-streaked and shoulders now trembling as she shouldered herself forwards to stare straight at Rooksnap. With a shaking breath she calmed herself down, looked her square in the eyes.

<strong>&quot;She would be <em>proud</em> of me, for standing up for someone who&#39;s finally lost herself to her delusions,&quot;</strong> she spit out the words, forcefully taking a step forward so now they were nose-to-nose. <strong>&quot;Doesn&#39;t it feel so good, to step on someone who just wants you to feel better? Berating everyone who cares about you is absolutely brilliant, too. <em>Genius.</em>&quot;</strong>

Marbledpaw had grown, what awkwardness in her unusually tall build having finally vanished into lean muscle; she was surprisingly satisfied at how they were now nearly the same height. Yet there was now an edge of doubt against her stark-hard words, now, tail lashing anxiously. <em>Mother and her were friends..</em>

Would Hazelhues really be proud?</span>

Suddenly, his unbroken attention on Rooksnap was... Well, broken.  The multicolored fur of Marbledpaw caught his eyes, and before long he realized that the others in the group had gathered around him.  At first he felt relieved at the fact that he no longer had to deal with the wrath of Rooksnap, but this didn&#39;t last long as he realized it hadn&#39;t ended the conflict, and instead did quite the opposite.  Before he could truly take in everything that was happening, he was pushed off to the side.  Both of Marigolddust&#39;s ears swerved back as he took in the argument, going from the catalyst to the audience.  Confusion stirred in his chest, although he got some clarity from Marbledpaw&#39;s words of reassurance.  Giving her a bit of a weak smile, he looked back towards Rooksnap in time to hear her toxic words to the rest of the adoptees.  Why the others had defended him so quickly, he wasn&#39;t sure, but it was comforting; until he realized that everyone was involved now.  Stronger than harsh words entered his ears and angry faces obsorbed all of his attention.  Relief and resentment mixed, overwhelming him as he stood mainly in the background and observed it all.  

             As Rooksnap and Marbledpaw were face-to-face, sharing words Marigolddust would have rather they kept to themselves, he tried to think up of some how to bring an end to this whole ordeal that he had started.  <em>Hazelhues?</em> The warrior&#39;s ears perked at the sound of the name.  She was Cloverpaw&#39;s mother, wasn&#39;t she?  <em>Now family&#39;s being insulted,</em> he thought, dread crawling up his spine.  <em><strong><em>&quot;M-maybe we should relax a little?  I-I&#39;m fine,&quot;</em></strong></em> he spoke up, although he doubted his voice could be heard over the aggressive words coming from both she-cats.  When he received little to no response, he stepped back again.  Why had he invited Rooksnap in the first place?  Marbledpaw even asked him not to drag her in and here she was, more involved than he was.</span>

Maybe he could get Cloverpaw and Blazepaw out of this before they got thrown too deep, too?  No, he doubted he could succeed, even if he did try.  So, instead he just stood back, speachlessly taking the spot of a bystander, even if he would rather be cooling everyone off.  All he could do at the moment is keep his eyes from watering any more than they were and hope nothing got any worse... Although perhaps if it did he would be a bit more... Useful.</span>

Rooksnap didn&#39;t flinch a single hair as Marbledpaw shoved up to her. She could see the insecurity in her violet eyes, see right through her. The fierce fa&#231;ade she wore over a storm of desperation and hurt was no match for the munchkin&#39;s astuteness.

<strong>&quot;Is that what you really think? Where did standing up get her, hm? Exiled. That&#39;s where it got her. Hazelhues had to leave you because she couldn&#39;t stop running her mouth. I suppose the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree-&quot;</strong>

Where was all this coming from? She and Hazelhues had been friends. Rooksnap had been sad to see her go, travelled to the outskirts of the territory to see her even, before she was murdered. But the words kept tumbling out like spilled blades in a blur.

She thought about Hazelhues&#39;s funeral, where Icestar&#39;s banishment had ultimately landed her. <em>Dead in the ground.</em> It had been nothing close to a proper burial for a warrior of her caliber, and a new mother nonetheless. <em>The world is a cruel place.</em>

Time and time again, Rooksnap had found herself disappointed in the inner workings of their reality. Famine and disaster had taken her father and mentor away from her - her own mother had died because of her. Beetlestreak had destroyed Fernpaw&#39;s dream, changed the course of her future, then left her to figure it out all by herself. Cloverpaw&#39;s, Blaze&#39;s, and Shallow&#39;s parents, whoever they were, had abandoned them without a second thought. Shallow had left them too soon, Kestrelpaw had gone off all on her own... Rooksnap&#39;s trust was wavering thin, and consequentially her logic. If only she could snap out of it before- <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span> <span class="mention" title="cake#9694">@cake</span> <span class="mention" title="Coywolffe#0013">@Sleepy Old Man Coy (He/Him)™</span> <span class="mention" title="northern foxy#8613">@spark&#39;s clone™</span> <span class="mention" title="-Swift-#3184">@-Jayfang-</span></span>

She stood between Marigolddust and Blazepaw as still as a statue, wondering how she was gonna hold both Rooksnap and Marbledpaw back if this were to escalate. Quietly her gaze traveled to the young tuxedo warrior in an almost silent apology - maybe this had gotten too extreme. Cloverpaw did quite literally thrive in these circumstances, but she could tell that Marigolddust definitely didn’t, and part of her wanted to grab him by his big head, cover his ears and tuck him away from the yelling. But at this point, it would be quite pointless.

“<strong>This is getting kind of pathetic.</strong>” But alas, Clover’s pleas were drowned out by the constant back and forth yelling. Wow! It was almost as if somebody had taken her back to the forest with the rogues. Marigolddust wasn’t the only one about to emotionally lose it. Because it was quite clear Rooksnap was going down the same path as poor, poor Grouse.

It was okay at first, seemingly a minor discussion that he assumed would just end in Marigolddust coming back defeated and nothing else. Marbledpaw jumping in was a surprise, but he guessed it was just because she didn&#39;t know any of them very well so he couldn&#39;t tell what they would or wouldn&#39;t do. However, Rooksnap&#39;s performance surprised him the most. Though they didn&#39;t interact too often lately, he had assumed she just needed a bit of space.. but now? The words she said, though not affecting him whatsoever, seemed to have been said with the worst intentions. She didn&#39;t seem like she needed any more space.

&quot;Hey,&quot; he greeted, standing slightly off to the side. &quot;What warranted those words?&quot; Jayfang asked, staring directly at Rooksnap. Without waiting for a response, he shook his head. &quot;Nothing. Now go apologize.&quot; The silver tom acted as if he was scolding an apprentice, despite the fact that Rooksnap was older than he was. In all honesty, Jayfang wasn&#39;t usually a mediator—he participated in fights, not stop them—so he probably shouldn&#39;t have stepped in whatsoever. However, his slightly delusional confidence lead him to believe his appearance would be enough to get both sides to back down.

A stone dropped and sank into her stomach, a torrent of water swirling against her heart till it twisted into something foul and eventually, grew hard. Decisively, the apprentice made up her mind that she wouldn&#39;t hold back anytime soon. 

<strong>&quot;Shut up,&quot;</strong> she stated once, quietly.  She did not shut up. Definitely not. And when a different warrior joined, violet gaze was pure poison, each glare shooting daggers at Jayfang&#39;s fur as he tried to intervene.

Then a whine of a roaring truck that passed by in her head made it&#39;s way across her ears till all Rooksnap&#39;s words flew across her and knocked breath out in the mess and jumble of tears and anger and hurt; disappointment in herself, bitterness for her mother&#39;s death, determination to avenge <em>someone</em> and not just be the kit that was left behind in ThunderClan because of exile. 

Claws unsheathed, and recklessly, swung it across Rooksnap&#39;s face. It hit the sweet spot - her eye, and a sick feeling of satisfaction bloomed from the blood that followed. Her paw, now soaked in blood, stamped on the ground.

<strong>&quot;Insult her again, I dare you.&quot;</strong>

<em><strong>“I dare you!“</strong></em> her body shoved forward now along with her words, still trembling as her voice rose an octave to an unrestrained scream. Marbledpaw charged towards Rooksnap for a second blow, only to be shoved aside before she could do more damage.</span>

Before Rooksnap&#39;s words could tear the family apart any further, an unsheathed paw flew into her vision and caught her across the eye. The rip of claws stung her face, spraying blood which freckled the scene. Rooksnap just barely saved herself from stumbling back, not even a roar of pain or infuriation rising from her. The warrior stood with her head hung low, face to the ground, freshly wounded eye closed tightly shut, panting slowly. Crimson fell in delicate strands visibly from the laceration.

After a moment she raised her head to survey the group again. Some stood in shock, others struggling to hold a furious Marbledpaw writhing to the ground. She could feel the glowy eyes of the rest of the clan watching them from the surrounding dens. Only her blue eye shone clearly now, cold and icy, the once warm yellow of its counterpart squinted behind a growing curtain of foul scarlet.

<strong>&quot;StarClan help you all,&quot;</strong> she growled resentfully just as the last rays of sunset vanished from the quarry, then turned and bounded out into the forest. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span> <span class="mention" title="cake#9694">@cake</span> <span class="mention" title="Coywolffe#0013">@Sleepy Old Man Coy (He/Him)™</span> <span class="mention" title="northern foxy#8613">@spark&#39;s clone™</span> <span class="mention" title="-Swift-#3184">@-Jayfang-</span> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

“<strong>Sorry, but you’re for sure not committing murder before I do,</strong>” Although she had jumped to defense, her stunned gaze flew to Marigolddust instantly, asking a silent question. <em>What.. just happened?</em>

She’d been outside of camp hunting while this altercation had been taking place, a bundle of two voles hanging from her jaws as she’d emerged from the camp entrance. When she stepped into the clearing, she was greeted with a clearly furious Rooksnap with blood streaming down from her eye, away from a group of apprentices clustered around Marigolddust. The deputy had dropped her prey her tufted ears flattened against her head as she let out a small gasp. <strong>”Rooksnap?!”</strong> she turned towards the smaller she-cat as she tried to stop her for a moment, only to see her already storming off.

 <em>What happened here?</em> 

Abandoning her parcels at the fern-guarded entrance, the russet-toned tortoiseshell approached the group that was holding Marbledpaw down. The metallic scent of blood hung in the air, and she could see it staining the young molly’s paw which she’d used to swipe at her clanmate. Her amber and blue gaze was burning, clearly enraged by the sight she’d witnessed. From an initial glance, it looked as if there was a falling out that had gotten ugly, and she was not going to tolerate violence against another clanmate. <strong>”Explain. Now.”</strong> her voice grew deathly stern, pupils narrowing to slits as she looked upon the group in utter fury. They’d better have had a good explanation for this mess. <strong>”What the hell happened just now?”</strong>

She was about to sprint after her, tackle Rooksnap to the ground and ruin her entire life over and over till Cloverpaw collided with her, pinned her tightly down and she stared up balefully, violet gaze looking upwards with furious intensity.

<strong>&quot;Get off me, you idiot-&quot;</strong> a hiss, tail lashing, but her breathing was already slowing down as her head wrapped around the crime she had done, blood draining from her face.

<strong>&quot;I..&quot;</strong> left suddenly at a loss of words, she shoved Cloverpaw off, brushing herself down and finding herself inable to explain what had hapened.

It felt like a fever dream, passing by with her vision tainted red and nothing else. <strong>&quot;I attacked her.&quot;</strong> she responded coldly at the demand for an answer and surprisingly unfazed by the rage present in the deputy&#39;s gaze. She straightened up, no sign of guilt apparent. Breathing thick and heavy, she looked at Laurelblaze firmly in the eye, though her throat was already trembling as if ready to cry. <strong>&quot;She deserved it, and I don&#39;t regret it at all.&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;I need some space.&quot;</strong>

And she turned tail so no one would see the tears that were springing now the faze of anger was over, slipping into the apprentice&#39;s den and deciding to do nothing but lie there.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Jayfang was stunned. At least, for a bit. He hadn&#39;t expected this fight to get physical, or for Rooksnap to run off, but it wasn&#39;t all that confounding. Clearly, Marbledpaw had lost her temper and lashed out. But at least she was being restrained now.

Laurelblaze caught him off guard, primarily because he hadn&#39;t notice her coming. He stared at the other cats, waiting for them to explain as he wasn&#39;t very involved. Marbledpaw seemed to speak, so he didn&#39;t have to. Jayfang watched as Marbledpaw explained—terribly, he thought—and as she turned around and fled. Twisting his head back towards the deputy, he realized he should probably explain in depth, but first and foremost.. 

&quot;I had no part in this, I was a bystander,&quot; Jayfang insisted, the lie partially true.

The argument continued on for a little bit, and when Marigolddust realized Jayfang was attempting to handle the situation he relaxed.  This new sense of calm didn&#39;t remain long, though, as Jayfang was ignored and Marbledpaw had her claws at Rooksnap&#39;s eyes.  The tom couldn&#39;t help but gasp at the sudden, swift movement of physical offense against the nanny.  He stood still there for a moment, stunned, as he looked over Rooksnap&#39;s fresh injury from afar.  The group of apprentices gathered around him disappeared and instead gathered around Marbledpaw and the muddy pelted molly, and it didn&#39;t take long for him to follow in persuit.  Worry and concern showed clearly in his lemon-toned gaze as he watched Rooksnap stalk away like a angry, defeated fox after being harmed by a patrol.  Biting his lip, he tried to get over his overwhelming confusion and clear his head.  It was hard to do this when he was still standing in the middle of the ruin after the war, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to leave the situation without making sure things were alright.  

               Meeting the vivid green pools of Cloverpaw&#39;s eyes, it wasn&#39;t hard for him to figure out what unspoken words were being said with the look.  Returning her question with a helpless expression, he shrugged and looked back in the direction that Rooksnap had left.  Could he have prevented this somehow?  Of course.  Why hadn&#39;t he?  Every muscle in his body froze with fear as he heard one of the two voices he didn&#39;t want to occumpany his ears in such a situation.  With his guilty conscience causing the fur on his spine to prickle, he hesitantly turned around to face Laurelblaze.  <em>What happened?</em> Not a very complicated question, but enough for him to feel shame resurface.  Although he seemed to have such a small part of this problem by now, he couldn&#39;t get it off his mind that he had caused Rooksnap to snap in the first place.</span>

             Swaying his tail back and forth anxiously, he tried to decide whether or not he should further explain the situation off of what Marbledpaw had said.  Reluctantly, he took a few steps forword to properly approach Laurelblaze.  <em><strong><em>*&quot;Um... I-I angered Rooksnap a little, a-and cats started getting dragged in and harsh words were shared, and it resulted in... Well, I think you know...&quot;</em></strong></em> He trailed off after saying the words so quickly, scared out of his pelt as to how the deputy would react.  He hadn&#39;t seen her so seriously angry until now, and truthfully it made her even more intimidating than she was.</span>

It seemed they were only trying to restrain Marbledpaw from doing any more damage it seemed, not that an apprentice would get very far in attacking an experienced warrior such as Rooksnap. Her tensed up frame relaxed a bit as she stared at the members of the group that the earth-toned she-cat had instigated the fight with. She’d have to speak with her later if she returned, this behavior on both ends was not going to be tolerated. Clanmates were never to lay their claws upon one another. Right now, she needed to have a discussion with Marbledpaw about this outburst. While she understood her frustration and anger at this betrayal, she needed to make sure this was not going to spiral.

<em>Poor thing… All of them. What spurred this reaction from Rooksnap?</em>

Her tail flickered as she spoke to the group once again. <strong>”I don’t want this happening again. I’ll speak to Rooksnap about this later but I want you all to stay away from each other.”</strong> meaning the group as a whole from Rooksnap, not from each cat she was addressing. They needed time to let the dust settle before trying to attempt a reconciliation, or at least getting onto neutral terms once again. <strong>”I need to talk to Marbledpaw. All of you just… Just clear your heads, do anything else.”</strong> she let out a small sigh as she glanced over towards the apprentice’s den where Marbledpaw had fled to. This had to be addressed here and now, mostly just to make sure the young molly was okay.

<em>Just what did she even say to cause her to attack?</em>

She really didn&#39;t want to think about her brother potentially skewing the perceptions of the others of her. She wasn&#39;t eager to start training, nonetheless, she was going to try and get it over with. Like ripping the bandage off a healed wound, it would sting for a little bit, but it was better than prolonging the pain. She&#39;d have to suck it up for now, until she received her &quot;warrior name&quot;, as if she was going to keep it once she finally ditched this place. She hated being contained to these walls of stone, only allowed to go out when a warrior permitted it. It was as if she was being perpetually watched and prevented from seeing the world without someone to guide her.

The black tortoiseshell huffed at the comment about her seeming to &quot;need&quot; company at the moment. She never was a social butterfly, if she was talking to someone, it was merely to either dictate what she wanted or it was with her siblings. <strong>&quot;Listen, Wrenpaw, I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re under the impression that I&#39;m in need of company. I get your heart is in the right place, but I&#39;m perfectly fine.&quot;</strong> her icy gaze narrowed as she twitched her whiskers in annoyance. Her words were a little harsh, but she never really curbed her language. Driving others away from her was best in her eyes for now. Viperpaw did not see the point in establishing connections to cats she&#39;d be leaving behind in the future, aside from her family. She&#39;d only be causing more pain for others and herself. It&#39;d be easier that way. It seemed like a lonely existence, but she was perfectly content being on her own. She was independent that way, loneliness did not scare her. She could handle it easily. <strong>&quot;The territory doesn&#39;t scare me, that&#39;s for sure. I don&#39;t know why clan cats like to constrain themselves in little territories, seems as if you&#39;re only willing to see one part of the world.&quot;</strong> she&#39;d only been a rogue for two moons of her life practically, as she was that old when she was brought here. Yet she was still a little spitfire, she missed being able to go wherever she pleased, now she had to obey borders. Set by who? Some ghost cats they believed lived in the night sky?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A fluffy mix of grey-colored fur slid through the entrance to ThunderClan camp. Now that he was finally an apprentice, Marrowpaw clearly enjoyed his freedom to come and go as he pleased. He trotted over to the low opening to the warrior’s den and shyly peered through the darkness with his bright amber eyes.
<em>What was his name again..?</em> the young tom pondered to himself as he tried to remember the name of his new mentor. The warrior had been present among those at the ceremony, standing out like a stray burr with his large jet-black appearance. Marrowpaw mustered his courage and called out carefully into the den: <strong>”Hello? Is Nightpanther here?”</strong> He gulped slightly, hoping he wasn’t disturbing the other napping warriors who were a few feet away.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Nightpanther’s expression on this beautiful day was anything but pleasant. His narrowed eyes glittered with the usual contempt and his lips were drawn back in a scowl. Sure he’d been hoping to be assigned his second apprentice for some time, but nothing was thrilling about meeting another mewling mess. As he slid through the opposite entrance of camp Nightpanther caught a glimpse of Marrowpaw’s turned back in front of the warriors den. 

<em>What in Starclan’s name</em> the adult tom snorted silently. Without a word he approached his new apprentice from behind and tapped the younger cat’s shoulder with the tip of his tail. 

<strong>”If there’s something you should know about me, it’s that I’m never in there.”</strong> He said sternly.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Marrowpaw whipped around quickly, making his fur fluff out like a disturbed badger. 
<strong>”H-hello.”</strong> The cat stammered, staring up at Nightpanther’s much larger figure. Even looking down from the highledge, Marrowpaw could tell the tom was large. Now that they were on even ground, he felt himself shrinking under the pressure of the warrior’s presence. 
<strong>”Oh okay.. I’ll keep that in mind, sorry.”</strong> The apprentice nodded, noticing the harsh note in Nightpanther’s tone. Trying his best to seem unbothered, Marrowpaw moved beside the black feline and introduced himself. <strong>”I’m Marrowpaw.. and Uh.. I’ll be your apprentice starting from today..”</strong>

They moved in the direction toward the entrance of camp with the intent to leave for their first lesson. His gaze rounded on the poor fellow beside him. 

<em>How can I cat live with so much fur attached to their hide</em> Nightpanther glared down in disbelief. <em>A normal cat would overheat and die..</em> the tom let out a low growl as their sides brushed from the sheer volume of Marrowpaw’s fur.  


<strong>”Starting today you’re an apprentice. Which means you’re in training to become a warrior that ThunderClan will utilize in any and all situations. I expect you to apply yourself and train hard so don’t let me catch you sleazing around.”</strong> Nightpanther lectured, unintentionally emulating his old mentor Gorsebite. 

<strong>”And one more thing,”</strong> He reached out with an enormous unsheathed paw and pushed the younger tom a little further away from his side. <strong>”Some distance will you? Your fur is going to smother me in this heat.”</strong>

He wondered if Nightpanther was known to be this strict and harsh.. he’d probably have to find some friends and ask them instead. Even if it seemed like his mentor was going to be hard to please, he inwardly resolved to follow Nightpanther’s orders to the best of his ability. If anything else, Marrowpaw knew his determination would carry him through. 

Before he could react, Marrowpaw’s body was shoved so easily to the side that he almost stumbled into the dust of the camp floor. Nightpanther was definitely packing a bigger punch than Marrowpaw could tell. Pulling himself up quickly, he hurriedly strode back up to his mentor’s side and sheepishly lowered his head. <strong>”Noted, I’m sorry.”</strong> 

And the two left camp, heading deep into the territory.

His paws were slow and unsteady as they dragged his tired body across the camp. His gaze flickered upward toward the camp, wary of seeing his mentor’s lime-colored eyes following him. Nightpanther had strictly ordered that he spend as much time in the territory and even comprised a list of tasks to complete aside from lessons. Even if Nightpanther was rigorous and unforgiving, Marrowpaw appreciated his mentor’s efforts to forge good habits in him. 

His amber eyes followed the clearing. The afternoon cool had drawn out a few felines he hadn’t met before, but his focus was snatched by the mouth-watering pile of fresh-kill in the camp’s center.

Viperpaw had been spending her brief break from training in camp. Instead of lounging around in the patches of sunlight littering the ground, she’d opted to stay under an overhanging canopy that provided an ample amount of shade. The black tortoiseshell did not feel up to sunbathing, not yet anyways. It was already rather hot out due to the fact that it was the middle of green-leaf, and they were approaching the height of the season rather quickly. It was only going to get hotter and hotter from here on out, until leaf-fall provided a nice respite from the ferocious heatwaves.

So, she stayed in camp, enjoying her time in the shade before Cinderblaze called upon her to return to training for the day. Her mentor wasn’t nearly as strict as Marrowpaw’s it seemed, but Viperpaw was not looking to cause trouble for her. She was keeping her nose clean for the most part to ward off suspicion from the warriors. The dark-furred molly was a bit of a flight-risk to put it lightly, she’d always been looking for ways to escape from this clan ever since she and her siblings were brought here as kits. In her mind, she was still Viper, the ferocious rogue kitten who could conquer the world. Not Viperpaw, the clan cat who was “collared” by some phony Warriors Code and the eyes of <em>their</em> ancestors, not hers. She had romantic views of the rogue territories, not truly understanding that she likely would have starved to death out there along with her littermates. Four kits could not fend for themselves out there, it wasn’t possible. The clan cats had saved them, but she didn’t view it as such. Speaking of which, one of them had passed her by on his way to the fresh-kill pile. 

Her icy-blue gaze narrowed, and she twitched her bobbed tail. Definitely someone her age based on how he was carrying himself. Exhausted and hungry it seemed, probably was out training. <strong>”Keep working like that and you’re gonna end up looking like an empty shell.”</strong> she muttered to herself with a slight roll of her eyes. Even she knew working too much could lead to overexertion, he clearly seemed like he was suffering from it. <strong>”Not that I care, it’s your funeral, you know.”</strong>

<em>You don’t seem perfectly fine to me,</em> Wrenpaw said silently to herself. Of course she’d never have the nerve to say anything like that out loud. Especially not to a cat with an attitude like the one Viperpaw harbored. The caramel furred molly wasn’t the type to stick up for herself when someone was being rude, nor could she bring herself to be rude in return. It just wasn’t in her nature, for now at least. <strong>”I don’t think you <em>need</em> it. I don’t know, I just thought you looked upset and I thought some company could help. My bad,”</strong> she said with a shrug of her shoulders. She still couldn’t hold the other she-cats gaze. Every word that came out of her mouth, every move that she made felt so awkward. Perhaps one day she would learn that she couldn’t solve everyone’s problems single pawed, and that was okay. For now however, the naive feline was convinced that she could be of use somehow. 

She tipped her head to the side at Viperpaw’s next words, thoughts churning with curiosity. She’d never heard anyone else in the clan speak of the clan territories or customs that way. She was also puzzled as to why Viperpaw seemed to separate herself from the rest of ThunderClan, as if she wasn’t a clan cat too. Maybe she didn’t see herself as one? <strong>”I’d never thought about that before. I guess it’s safer to stay in one place? And if we had too much territory we wouldn’t be able to protect it.”</strong> Everything Wrenpaw said was just an educated guess, really. She didn’t know why the clans restricted themselves to their lands and never traveled elsewhere, aside from the stories she’d heard of them traveling across the mountains in search of their current lake home. She was grateful for the subject change, but she knew Viperpaw still wasn’t a fan of her company, no matter what they were talking about. <strong>”Listen, if.. if you want me to leave you alone I will. I’m sorry I bothered you in the first place.”</strong> She muttered awkwardly, shuffling her paws against</span>

He didn’t recognize it, but furrowed his expression at her chilly comment. <strong>”I can’t really help it.. I’m starting to think my mentor finds it fun.”</strong> The long-furred tom huffed with halfhearted enthusiasm. Nightpanther was demanding for sure, but it didn’t faze him. If anything, Marrowpaw’s strong work ethic led him to enjoy hunting and training.  


The tom made eye contact with Viperpaw. She seemed a few moons older, but he couldn’t recall seeing her at an apprenticeship ceremony. <em>Maybe she wasn’t from ThunderClan?</em> Marrowpaw pondered, but quickly pushed the thought aside. 

He lowered his head and gently picked up a vole, knowing that it was alright for him to take a bite since it was after sundown now and most cats had already been fed.
<strong>”Do you want to share?”</strong> The polite note in his tone was cautionary, but only because he didn’t want to intrude on the other apprentice’s time. <strong>”I’m Marrowpaw by the way, you are..?”</strong>

Wrenpaw was rather lucky, Viperpaw was known for having a short fuse when others were bugging her. She understood the other apprentice did not mean her any harm or offense with her words, but she truly felt that she’d be better off by herself. Yet at the same time, isolating herself and becoming a recluse from the rest of the clan was just a recipe for gaining a bad reputation amongst them. She’d be more conspicuous whenever she made an appearance in camp. It would not bode well for her in her efforts on returning to a rogue’s life. The black tortoiseshell let out a small sigh as she saw how the caramel-colored she-cat seemed rather despondent about her being unable to make her smile or something to indicate she wasn’t upset. Viperpaw nodded to her peer upon her suggestion. Perhaps it’d be best if they parted ways lest she accidentally make this other she-cat cry or something. Now <em>that</em> would be bad.

<strong>”Go hang out with the others. Really, I’m fine.”</strong> she just wanted out of this conversation really, not trying to cause any more problems that had already been stirred up. Wrenpaw didn’t deserve to face her wrath or anger, but she didn’t want her to feel too upset. Viperpaw knew she was a bit cold, but mostly to those who she felt needed a reminder to be humbled a bit. Some of these clan cats walked around all high and mighty sometimes, it irritated her to the high heavens. Wrenpaw wasn’t like that though, given her compassion towards others. It was admirable, but again, she wasn’t looking for new friends. Not ones she might actually miss when she left this place anyways.

In truth, she was only <em>just</em> appointed to being an apprentice, she just acted much more mature for her age in her speaking mannerisms. She wanted to carry herself like she would as an adult, yet in some aspects she still retained her immature, awkward transition from a kitten into a young cat. Her attitude was a clear indication of this, she behaved rather childishly with how she regarded the clan and did not let go of grudges easily. Viperpaw was stubborn to a fault, a keystone part of her personality since birth it seemed. One that would take time to outgrow. If she ever did, at least.

She flicked an ear upon hearing his offer, quickly declining it with a shake of her head. <strong>”No thanks, I ate earlier. I’m Viperpaw.”</strong> the suffix these clan cats gave her made her skin crawl, that wasn’t her name. It was just <em>Viper</em>, that was all. Yet she had to blend in for now, she’d have to cope with it for now. <strong>”You might want to take a swig of water with that one to wash it all down you know. I heard dehydration is a pretty bad way to die.”</strong> her words were ever so grim, almost as if she was purposely trying to ward him away like she did to pretty much anyone she wasn’t related to. It became a second language to her practically, and if the stubborn ones weren’t so easily shooed away, she wasn’t afraid to bare her fangs and tell them to get lost. This was her version of being polite, as harsh as it was. Still, she figured it was time she actually did look as if she had a social life, just to avoid questioning from her mentor or the deputy and that mate of hers, her “adoptive mothers”. What made these clan cats so eager to be all chummy with one another? It was annoying.

<strong>”Who even is your mentor anyways? Is he some sort of sadist or something?”</strong>

Ever since Nightpanther had commented on how his fur made him hot, the apprentice had grown slightly self-conscious. Marrowpaw, though already long-haired was even more so since he had yet to lose his kitten fuzz. It was very obvious around some parts of his body, especially the tips of his ears, paws and tail. Compared to Viperpaw, it was obvious that he was still young. 

<strong>”Not a bad idea.”</strong> Marrowpaw sighed. <strong>”I know I’m probably saying this way too soon, but I think dying of thirst wouldn’t be the worst idea right now.”</strong> -Of course he was merely joking. 

<strong>”I actually don’t know much about him myself.”</strong> Marrowpaw admitted with a rueful look on his face. <strong>”His name is Nightpanther.. all I really know is that he’s huge.. and strict.. he kind of scares me.”</strong> The apprentice’s tail fluffed out slightly as he recalled the scowling expression on the older cat’s face every time he made an error. <strong>”What about your mentor?”</strong>

It was clear to see that Wrenpaw’s help was not wanted or needed in this situation. The new apprentice couldn’t help but feel a little crestfallen. If she had it her way, she would be friends with every apprentice in ThunderClan. The exact opposite of Viperpaw, she <em>was</em> a social butterfly and she enjoyed being surrounded by friends. Of course any cat valued their alone time, but Wrenpaw imagined that being alone all the time was very… well, lonely. She supposed maybe that was just her opinion though, and if Viperpaw didn’t feel lonely then that was good for her. 

Maybe at first Wrenpaw had thought that the other apprentice would warm up to her, but those feelings were long gone now. While she appreciated that Viperpaw had maintained her temper, Wrenpaw knew that wouldn’t be the case if she continued to bother her. Whatever patience the other molly had was sure to run out soon. Wrenpaw got to her paws, and offered Viperpaw one more friendly smile. <strong>”Well, alright then. If you change your mind you can hang out with us, or me, whenever.”</strong> She added. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

Marigolddust was lying down in his nest, seemingly lost in his thoughts as he played with the new feather he had earned from his most recent meal.  Although he was examining the brown-marked feather so closely, he didn&#39;t really take in any of the patterns that he would have otherwise admired.  It had been a day since the whole picnic incident already, although the sun had yet to reach its peak in the sky.  There weren&#39;t many clouds to save the camp from Green-Leaf&#39;s heat, and the high temperatures and humidity made him feel as if he was melting.  He felt lazy, comfortable, and tired, but there was no chance that he would be able to sleep while his mind was so busy.  He had only recently woken up, anyways, and he wouldn&#39;t stay true to his role as a warrior if he slept the day away.  Fernpaw was away temporarily, having had gone off to gather herbs before he had truly gotten over his grogginess.  

           Did Rooksnap really not want him anymore?  He had thought she was just sad and distraught, not... <em>Angry.</em> But she had seemed so enraged when he tried talking to her the day before.  It was for a good reason, though.  He shouldn&#39;t have prodded her like he had, and everyone else had even thought of his actions as unwise.  Well, he knew now how much more wise the group of apprentices, and Jayfang, were than him.  Sticking the feather snuggly and securely into his nest, he set his paw over his eyes to block out the headache inducing sunlight.  <em>Grow up.</em> Rooksnap had finally voiced it, and he felt it was necessary.  He had been more cowardly than any of the apprentices who had been by his side, and the majority of them were many moons younger than him.  Wasn&#39;t he supposed to be the adult?  He didn&#39;t even stand up to Rooksnap when she beat up on Marbledpaw!  He knew the multicolored fem would have defended him.  Technically, she already had before that whole fallout had happened.</span>

             Releasing a sigh, he brought himself to his paws and stretched.  Breakfast... That was a good idea.  His stomach seems to agree as it growled in protest to the lack of food.  Perhaps it would have been a good idea to grab something a bit larger than a sparrow for dinner the day before.   Yawning, he sleepily padded out of the den, not realizing how close he was to the vines until he was reminded by the leaves as they brushed against his face.  Scrunching up his muzzle, he brook a step back and went around the vines and out the exit.  Once he had gotten to the prey pile, he picked out a small rabbit and brought it to the side of the camp with him.  Lying down, he placed the rabbit in front of him before taking a small bite.</span>

<em>Nightpanther, huh.</em> she didn’t know that cat in particular, mostly because she tended to avoid the adults in general. If she didn’t need to talk to them about something, why bother them and intrude? Seemed pointless to bother someone when they might be busy with who knows what. <strong>”Sounds like a total drag if you ask me.”</strong> she scrunched up her nose a bit at the thought. At least her mentor didn’t seem like a total drill-sergeant, she at least was somewhat nice, if not a bit giddy at the fact she was training someone. <strong>”My mentor is Cinderblaze, she seems… Nice.”</strong> she shrugged her shoulders, not knowing how else to describe the she-cat she’d been assigned to as an apprentice. Viperpaw did not know her very well, thus she was more so an acquaintance if anything. Superficial knowledge at best. She figured the same could be said for Marrowpaw about his mentor. <strong>”Maybe he’ll lighten up a bit, just be glad you didn’t get the leader for a mentor. My brother, Featherpaw, is being trained by her. I would not want to be in his place right now.”</strong> she’d certainly wouldn’t want to be taken under the leader’s wing, especially considering it was the deputy of ThunderClan who’d adopted her and her siblings. Just added unnecessary attention to them all, she hated the thought of it.

<strong>”Really?”</strong> The fluffy tom’s eyes rounded curiously upon the she <strong>”I would have thought it was a privilege to train directly under Icestar.. but I kind of get what you mean.. it’s probably quite the pressure.”</strong> He stifled a sigh and curled his tail over his paws. It was a bit unfortunate that there wasn’t anyone who could really fill him in on details on Nightpanther. After all, he was curious to know if there was more to the burly Warrior tom than just his brute nature. He watched Viperpaw shrug at the name of her own mentor, drawing blanks as he tried to recall a face to the name.  <strong>”I don’t know Cinderblaze yet, but I’m envious.”</strong> Marrowpaw noted as he raised a paw and drew it over his ear a few times. When the other apprentice mentioned her brother, he raised a brow. <strong>”Are you close to your siblings?”</strong> He asked, knowing that in typical clan life the existence of a tight nuclear family was rare. The clans survived on the fact that the group’s welfare was stressed above all and Marrowpaw knew this.

It seemed Wrenpaw took the hint at last and the black tortoiseshell nodded, both as a goodbye and an answer to her offer. While she likely would not take it, she figured it’d just be courteous to acknowledge the fact that it did exist and that she was open to take it if she wanted. Still, in her mind she felt it was best she kept her distance from the others. Viperpaw wasn’t going to betray others’ trust by leaving them all of a sudden, her siblings knew of her plan and would be ready for when she did not return to camp one day. They’d cope and take solace within one another, but this was the path she believed she was meant to walk, even if it was alone.

<em>It has to be this way, I wasn’t meant for this clan, I know I wasn’t.</em>

Yet that didn’t dull the sting of not having her family at her side though. Though she felt they’d be with her in spirit, the young molly was absolutely sure of it. Even if they were miles apart, she wouldn’t hesitate to come running for them if they needed their sister’s help, she vowed to be their protector anyhow. So for now, she was going to keep taking this path, surely nothing would stand in her way.

The air in camp felt tenser than usual in the days that passed since the incident between Rooksnap and the apprentices. She’d only witnessed the end of it, where the munchkin warrior had left camp, clearly enraged with a wounded eye. Needless to say, things were a bit rocky around camp, cats were in bad moods, and others were just utterly confused as to what had happened. Even she was suspended in a state of disbelief, how could a cat like Rooksnap turn on the cats she raised with nothing but affection? It was strange, as if something came over the earthen-toned femora, but what? She likely would never know, and part of her was afraid to ask. Nor was it her place, even as the deputy. Right now, she was focused on checking up on the targets of the warrior’s wrath, having started with Marbledpaw, the one who’d dealt the blow to the warrior’s eye. She and Icestar would have to discuss how to go about the whole assaulting another clanmate issue at a later date. Right now was not the best time, the tortoiseshell knew she must have been hurting in that moment.

<em>StarClan knows I might have done the same if Rooksnap said that about my mother, even if she was nothing like Hazelhues.</em>

Her family meant everything to her, and she could sympathize with young Marbledpaw. She’d lost nearly everyone, even her extended family save for one uncle was no longer within the camp’s walls. It was isolating, as if she’d been marooned within a forest with no one else to turn to… She couldn’t even imagine what she had been going through, and for Rooksnap to even say those things about her kin? <em>I’m going to have a long talk with her if she shows her face around here. No one deserves that cruelty, even she knows that.</em> the thought made her fur bristle, and she clenched her teeth in her jaw. Raising kits meant loving them unconditionally, and Marbledpaw did nothing to her to warrant that kind of treatment. None of them did. Now she wasn’t even here to try and fix the problems she had made, refusing to fess up to it and making amends. It was cowardly in her eyes, that wasn’t the Rooksnap she knew.

She let out a shaky sigh as she relaxed a bit, the deputy could not keep thinking about this, lest she go on a rampage on the tree bark in the forest. They’d end up getting marked with her claws permanently at this rate, but this entire situation just made her want to rip her own fur out of her sides, that was how angry she was. Her heterochromatic gaze drifted across camp, before landing on the familiar sight of Marigolddust, munching on a rabbit. Perhaps she should go talk to him, to see how he was coping. Maybe she’d end up calming down a bit, StarClan knows she nearly scared the daylights out of them all when she approached them with fire blazing in her eyes after the fight. Laurelblaze stepped over to the tom with a dip of her head, <strong>”Hey, Marigolddust.”</strong> before she came right out and asked the question that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue for a while: <strong>”Are you doing all right?”</strong>

Truly, she worried about poor Featherpaw. He was a bit of a dense one if she was going to be completely honest. She loved her family, but she hoped Icestar had a lot of patience with him. The poor tom already dealt with a bunch of tongue lashings from her in the past from some things he’d said. <strong>”My siblings and I are close, yes. And if anyone does try to mess with them, I will tear them apart.”</strong> her pupils narrowed a bit, eyes growing eerily dark for just a moment as she stared down the tom with a grave expression. She was entirely serious about that too, she was not just all bark, she was not afraid to rip into anyone for messing with her family. Many have faced her wrath before, her reign of terror over the nursery had become one over the apprentice’s den. She could be a <em>bully</em>, but only for the right reasons. <strong>”So mind yourself when you speak with them, if you do. I’m always watching out for them… Always. Otherwise something terrible might happen.”</strong>

Now that was a vague threat if there was one. Her specialty, she liked to surprise others with what she had in store for them.

Viperpaw’s stance relaxed and a small smirk adorned her freckled features, now that was amusing to her. Striking mild fear into the hearts of others was a bit of a pastime for her, she wasn’t crazy enough to do anything rash, but she’d gladly make someone’s day much worse if they decided to mess with the wrong cats. She liked to think of herself as an evil genius in some ways.

Marrowpaw wasn’t bothered by the threat only because he knew he wouldn’t have a reason to cross Viperpaw’s siblings.. or anyone for that matter. The tom was certainly not the type to go looking for an argument or quarrel out of boredom. He watched Viperpaw’s already-harsh expression become more vindictive as she seemed to envision bringing her imaginary perpetrators to their demise. <em>I guess there really are some cats who are close to their families...</em> He thought to himself, feeling a slight churn of unease as she smirked. 
<strong>”Don’t worry.”</strong> Marrowpaw said with a good natured twitch of his whiskers. <strong>”I wouldn’t think of it.”</strong> The apprentice reassured. <strong>”It’s kind of interesting that you’re close to them though. Most cats I know usually care more about the clan than family ties.”</strong> the grey tom murmured as he tried to imagine the feeling of having a protective sibling like Viperpaw. 

<strong>”Like.. I haven’t really spoken to my siblings since we became apprentices.”</strong> He explained calmly. <strong>”My litter was also kind of big since my mom adopted a few other kits a little after a were born.”</strong> Marrowpaw could vaguely remember the faces of his non-blood related siblings. There had been three of them, plus his two actual siblings. <strong>”Even though i was the oldest, I didn’t actually know they weren’t related to us till a lot later.”</strong>

The sight of the deputy&#39;s large form didn&#39;t fail to catch the young warrior&#39;s attention as she came a bit nearer, even if it was before she had took notice of him.  He couldn&#39;t stop his tail from twitching nervously as he met her eyes.  It was hard for him not to feel like he had done something wrong, and with the look she had on her face- was it conflicted?- he didn&#39;t doubt that she was thinking about something in particular.  It seemed like a lot of cats were, no matter how strongly Marigolddust wished it would just be swept away by the wind and never brought back.  But, he gave the tortoiseshell a smile as she approached him as he curled his tail around himself, close enough where if he had to he could trap it.  Body language was always a bother when a cat wanted to look like they felt something different than they did in reality.  

                <em><strong><em>&quot;Hey Laurelblaze,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, his tone friendly as he spoke the well known name.  In truth, the sudden approach with the question wasn&#39;t as expected as the greeting had been.  Going quiet, he adverted his gaze to his rabbit, thinking over the question.  Quickly bringing an end to the short silence, he nodded, returning the smile to his face.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Mhm, maybe just a little tired,&quot;</em></strong></em> he responded, although he knew that if he met her eyes it would be revealed that he didn&#39;t just feel tired.  Instead, he glanced around camp, trying to locate some cat unknown to both Laurelblaze and himself.  He didn&#39;t exactly feel the want to talk about the whole situation that had happened or what was left with him afterwords.  What good would it do him if he did?  He doubted it would make him feel any better, and he didn&#39;t want to be insulted or humiliated by himself.</span>

                Biting his lip, he decided he&#39;d try and change the subject early.  <em><strong><em>&quot;What about you?  How are you today?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked, returning his gaze to the deputy.  He was sure that the emotions he wanted to hide had finally heeded his wishes and covered themselves up deep in his mind again by now.  

            Raising a paw, he stripped off another piece of the meat and stuck it in his mouth, savoring the full flavor that the rabbit offered.  It gave a distraction and diminished some of his hunger.  Although, Laurelblaze gave him another distraction.  If he succeeded in changing the subject, then perhaps the conversation would be easy going and nice.  It would be distracting whether he was successful or not either way, though, wouldn&#39;t it?  Talking wasn&#39;t his favorite thing in the world, especially when it made him feel exposed, but he had heard many times from queens when they chided a kit taken out of the nursery that talking was a good release from negative feelings.  Would that be true to him, though?  His problems were&#39;t about some other kit accidentally stepping on his tail, they were about his own poor realizations of things he&#39;d rather have never learned, such as the fact that Rooksnap didn&#39;t want him around.  Curling a moon-shaded paw, he dug his claws into the blades of grass and the soft soil under the rabbit.  He had no need to go down that train of thought, not right now.  He still had duties after he finished breakfast, and being plagued by such upsetting topics wouldn&#39;t make catching a mouse any easier.</span>

Well, she was quite the opposite to some of the cats in the clan. She wasn’t born here, why should she care about something so trivial such as clan status or ties? Her siblings were the only ones that mattered to her here. They were her kin, she only stuck around for now to make sure they were gonna end up all right in the end when it was time for her to leave. Someone had to be the mature one in their family, though she did place much of her faith in Tigerpaw and Foxpaw… Featherpaw definitely needed them in her eyes.

<strong>”Well that sucks, my siblings are my only blood relations in the clan so needless to say, I’m stuck with them. Or rather, they’re stuck with me.”</strong> she couldn’t imagine being brought here without them, they were her rock practically. They brought stability to her otherwise tumultuous self, and motivated her to achieve her goals of bettering her life for herself. Meanwhile, she was being raised alongside a few other adoptive children of Laurelblaze and Hollyfrost, and there were quite a few of them. Yet the deputy and her mate had an odd talent of dividing her time to give them all attention, whether it was wanted or not. Viperpaw shuddered at all the times they’d nearly smothered her in affection, it was sickening! <strong>”Maybe you should try talking to them, ask them how they’re doing. I’m sure they’ll love to know their brother cares about them.”</strong>

She used to bottle up her feelings for a long time, though in private she often released her rage or frustration against a tree or the ground when she needed to relieve her stress. When she was conflicted or upset however, she’d often struggled with processing her emotions. So when the time came when she couldn’t possibly hold them in anymore, she practically exploded in emotion. She remembered a few times where she had utterly broken down as a result of her feelings. It wasn’t healthy, and over time she’d come to realize it wasn’t weak to feel sadness or grief outwardly, or even frustration. It was healthy to talk about it, to overcome her struggles with the support of her clanmates. That was what they all were there for, protect and help one another when they were going through their own struggles. They were meant to be a support system, as the individual did affect the clan as a whole.

<strong>”I’ve just been thinking a lot lately. Got a lot on my mind.”</strong> she sounded rather weary mentioning this, as if she’d been dwelling on the same thoughts for days on end. Yet that was exactly what it was, she’d been stuck on the same thoughts as if they were playing in her mind on a loop, never ending, at least not until she voiced them to someone else. She trusted Marigolddust though, he was a good cat in her book, sometimes he reminded her of a little brother of hers.  <strong>”I’m worried about you and the others, after the whole incident with Rooksnap? Are you sure you guys are gonna be all right? You know you can always come to me if you need to talk.”</strong> the deputy was not one for beating around the bush and rambling about other things before getting to her point. She’d rather get this over with and actually move past it so they could enjoy a normal conversation. That was usually how she approached these things, even if it wasn’t the most delicate means. Still, letting these issues fester was never a good thing, so it was best they dealt with it right away. 

<strong>”Just let me know if any of you need anything, I saw things got ugly.”</strong>

The suggestion made Marrowpaw’s ears prick with interest. <strong>”Maybe I should.”</strong> He hummed, trying to imagine the scenario. His brother, Bonepaw was likely busier than he was and enjoying his training under a much more pleasant mentor. 

<strong>”Ohh.. “</strong> Marrowpaw crooned as he realized what the she-cat was saying. <strong>”So I guess that would mean you’re not from ThunderClan?”</strong> His voice was mixed with both curiosity and a bit of admiration. In the recent years, it had become widely known that ThunderClan was one of the more forgiving clans when it came to accepting outsiders. Rarely were they turned away, especially if they had the potential and means of pulling their own weight. It seemed that the concept of “pure-blooded” clan cats were antiquated. Marrowpaw knew he wouldn’t be surprised if it turned out that being of true ThunderClan heritage was now a minority. It wasn’t as if cats really kept track of those things either.. did they? <strong>”Did you and your siblings come here alone..?”</strong> He asked with a concerned frown. Viperpaw, though she had a mature air, was close to his age. Had she really been all alone with her siblings all this time..? It sounded awfully chaotic.

<strong>”Really? Did it take you this long to realize I wasn’t clan-born and was adopted with my littermates? Was it the fact I was raised by two she-cats or the fact I regard the entire clan with scorn?”</strong> she quirked a brow as her tone shifted to one that was a bit more curt and borderline mocking. She was not one to keep her feelings to herself when it came to this place. Viperpaw had no choice when it came to being brought here. Something in their Warrior Code dictated they had the right to take in kits that needed help or something. They were legally allowed to kidnap kits from outside the clan is what it sounded like. She <em>never</em> let the others hear the end of it, she was bitter about being forced into the life of a clan cat when she was born a rogue and wanted to stay that way. It explained quite a bit of her mannerisms, she was rude, and quite disrespectful towards her clanmates. 

<strong>”Our illustrious deputy Laurelblaze and her mate Hollyfrost found my siblings and I out in the territory. They claimed we were on our own and needed help. Hence why we were brought here, against my will might I add.”</strong> she remembered trying to fight her way out of their clutches that day, she was a fierce little kitten. She wanted nothing to do with them, especially considering she was looking to protect her siblings from them. <strong>”They adopted us, so to speak.”</strong> she let out a small huff and flicked her bobbed tail. She didn’t think she had to explain this, most cats knew she was being looked after by them. They were both pretty prominent figures in the clan and were known for their hoarding of kittens needing families.

<strong>”Well sorry, it wasn’t exactly written on your forehead.”</strong> He retorted humorously. <strong>”To be fair, I didn’t know both of those things.. since it’s the first time we’ve ever talked?.”</strong> Marrowpaw’s responses rolled freshly off his tongue. His eyes darted side-to-side as he tried to imagine the clan’s deputy mothering the feisty she-cat. The tom felt a bit lost at Hollyfrost’s name, but his question dissipated as he listened to Viperpaw’s story. 

<strong>”Well, you definitely don’t seem happy about that.”</strong> He sounded slightly smug, yet sympathetic. He could stand to see why Viperpaw was unhappy about being plucked off the forest floor with her siblings. After living alone and likely being used to fending for themselves, living with the clan must had been a great change for them. He couldn’t help but wonder if the other apprentice viewed clan life as too soft and easy. Marrowpaw flicker an ear toward the side in thought. <strong>”I doubt they’ll let you leave as an apprentice.”</strong> He murmured. <strong>”But if you became a warrior and formally requested to leave, I doubt they could do anything then.”</strong> Marrowpaw, though knowledgeable about the warrior code, genuinely hated forcing others to do things they didn’t want. If Viperpaw was so keen on leaving, then why shouldn’t she? It wasn’t hurting anyone. <strong>”Even if you might not like them very much, I’m sure your moms would be a bit sad though.”</strong> He said ruefully, wondering if Viperpaw cared about how they would feel if she chose to strike out on her own.

Well it seemed she met someone equally as capable of countering her hostile words. She let out a small chuckle at the comment, a bit impressed by it actually. Most of the time the others would back off by now, she knows she’d already scared poor Wrenpaw off when she insisted on being alone after their shared ceremony. <strong>”Wow, do all ThunderClanners have mind-reading abilities? I’m thinking of a number between one through ten.”</strong> her response to his observation on her happiness was sardonic, though truly she wanted to see what sort of witty responses he had in that noggin of his. She actually didn’t mind cats as sharp-tongued as her, in fact the molly found it amusing.

<strong>”You think they’d just let me walk out of here if I ask politely? You’ve gotta be joking, you don’t know how clingy some of these cats are.”</strong> she can imagine Laurelblaze blocking her path to the entrance trying to convince her to stay. That burly, scarred beast was nothing if not persistent, she’d be a blubbering mess though. No, if she were to leave she’d have to go in the middle of the night on her own with not a single word to her family or the clan. That was how it was supposed to be, she wanted to disappear without a trace. <strong>”I want to live the life I feel was meant for me, it’s what I want. How others feel about the choices I make for myself shouldn’t influence my decisions.”</strong> she was dead-serious about that too, she did not want any of them influencing the choices she made for herself. Making her feel guilty, supporting her, no, she had to remain impartial. This was her choice, not theirs.

Marrowpaw was glad that Viperpaw hadn’t been offended. Instead, she seemed equally amused by his responses. Her soft chuckle made the atmosphere a bit more friendly as he did the same. The tom rolled his eyes jokingly as he glanced back toward the tortoiseshell feline.  <strong>”On a scale of how badly you wanna get outta here?
“</strong> A light smirked lined his lips. <strong>”28.”</strong> Marrowpaw was enjoying the conversation, glad that he could find somebody who wasn’t sensitive over witty remarks. His ears flicked forward as he listened to her prediction of Laurelblaze’s reaction. 

<strong>”Is she?”</strong> The tom’s question was of course, rhetorical. His amber eyes glanced to the highledge, realizing that her expectations were realistic. After all, Viperpaw could be barred from leaving for a few reasons. <em>Especially if she had clan intel..</em> He wouldn’t put it past the other clans to not try and take advantage of Viperpaw if she had valuable knowledge on ThunderClan. She was also close to the deputy.. she could find herself being used as leverage in a worst-case scenario. The tom made a slight grimace as he dismissed the unpleasant thought. <strong>”As you should. In the end, nobody’s opinion really matters anyway.”</strong> He affirmed her final statement. <strong>”Do you like training?”</strong> The tom asked, changing the subject to something a bit more lighthearted. <strong>”You seem like you’d enjoy fighting over hunting.”</strong>

She couldn’t stifle a chuckle at the jab at her scaling of how much she wanted to leave this clan already. <strong>”Wrong, make it a hundred.”</strong> her eyes glinted with amusement, for once someone wasn’t actually making her want to slam her head against a wall. Viperpaw wasn’t entirely sure she’d met her match just yet, however, she could be rather vicious when it came to the creativity of her insults. She’d rather save them for someone worthy of them though, if they decided to test the severity of her wrath. That’d be a confrontation that would likely be their last, she did not hold back and would not until they gave in to her. She hated losing, especially in arguments.

<strong>”Both of them are attached to their kits practically at the hip, wanting to keep their big happy family all together. So that’s pretty clingy.”</strong> she huffed quietly, without taking into account that randomly ditching her family might make them feel as if she were abandoning them for her own selfish wishes. This clan wasn’t her home in her eyes though, and if they were family, they should be supporting her in all of her endeavors. So much for that, it seemed. <strong>”Training is boring, I just deal with it so I can get to doing what I want. Usually I’ll find quiet spots in the forest, climbing trees is tricky with my tail being so short.”</strong> short was an understatement, it was a stub practically. It made balancing tricky, and climbing required a lot of it. One thing she’d have to account for when she was out hunting, she had to take extra precautions while she was out there trying to do so. <strong>”Fighting is a little easier, I guess.”</strong>

Marrowpaw couldn’t resist a quick glance at the stub and then back to Viperpaw’s face. He wondering if it had been altered or if she had been born that way, but didn’t venture to ask. He pawed gently at a small sprout growing in between his paws as he listened to her opinion on the deputy and her mate with a light chuckle. <strong>”Sounds a bit like a hoarding situation, but yeah I guess that is a little clingy.”</strong> Of course Marrowpaw meant well. In fact, he was glad to hear that they cared so much about their offspring. A light smile curved his lips as he comedically tried to imagine Laurelblaze as a doting mother -or perhaps it was her mate that was more maternally attuned to their children?

<strong>”I hate climbing trees.”</strong> There was a look of annoyance in his amber eyes as he spoke. <strong>”My mentor a Nightpanther makes me do it all the time, but the feeling of the bark on my claws makes me want to die.”</strong> Marrowpaw shivered with convinction. <strong>”The scraping feeling is actually the worst thing in the world and don’t even get me started on the splinters.”</strong> The tom complained. <strong>”Have you tried sparring? I’m not the best, but if you ever want to practice to pass the time, we could go out together.”</strong> He offered.

Well, from her own observations the two she-cats didn’t take on any more mouths than they could handle. Both were heavily involved with their kits, along with their own duties to the clan. Neither of them were true queens in a way, Laurelblaze had to remain focused on her duties as a deputy and Hollyfrost was equally as headstrong about serving her clan. They both were extremely dedicated to duty, something she didn’t understand fully. Shouldn’t living also have time for things besides family and work? It seemed miserably stressful. She wasn’t going to spend so many hours of her day on work like they did, she didn’t have any aspirations like they did. It wasn’t like it was really gonna matter in the end anyways.

<strong>”Not yet, my mentor is mostly focused on showing me the basics right now it seems. I was only promoted a half-moon ago I want to say.”</strong> she didn’t have the exact amount of days since her ceremony, not that she was the type to count how many days she’d been apprenticed for. She’d resemble a prisoner counting the days they’d been locked away for at this rate, even if it’d be fitting for her. <strong>”Sounds like a pretty good change of pace from normal training though.”</strong>

<em>The basics... must be nice</em> Marrowpaw’s ear twitched, thinking back to his training sessions with his own mentor. Nightpanther’s definition of “basic training” was very different than most. Still, he couldn’t complain as it was benefitting him more in the end. <strong>”A half-moon ago?”</strong> He blinked. <strong>”That’s not too far off from my ceremony..”</strong> He looked upwards as though trying to count how many weeks had passed since. <strong>”I think in a few more days it’ll be my first moon as an apprentice.”</strong> But he sounded unsure. 

<strong>”Sure. I’ll ask my mentor about it.”</strong> He said cheerfully, collecting the bits of prey that he had finished. He carefully stood up, swaying slightly on his paws. <strong>”I’ll catch you later then Viperpaw. I should probably get some water like you were talking about and then head out for some tracking practice.”</strong> He waved his fluffy tail as he turned toward the entrance of camp once again. He paused, throwing one last look at her over his shoulder. 

<strong>”You know, even if you really hate it here, I’m glad you came.”</strong> the tom chuckled before contentedly padding away.

Well, it seemed he was finally letting her off the hook. She could get back to silently brooding on her own at last. She sat up a bit and nodded, watching as the tom began to pad off a bit, but not before shooting one last exchange in her direction. <em>I’m glad you came.</em> the words rang in her ears like they were a foreign object, and she visibly stiffened up upon hearing them. Her eyes widened and she stared at her paws, and she felt her cheeks grow surprisingly hot from embarrassment— <em>What? No! I can’t have people liking me, no no no!</em> she couldn’t process the compliment since they were rather rare to come by from her peers. It was strange, someone actually said something nice about her despite all her efforts to drive them off!

She clenched her teeth a bit as she looked away with a low growl, muttering to herself a bit. Her fur was bristling for a moment, before she let out a resigned sigh. Just great, she might have just made a <em>friend</em>, one she actually didn’t mind and might have actually liked to talk to! <strong>”Stupid mousebrain.”</strong> she huffed under her breath, an insult meant for the cat who’d just walked away, but she didn’t actually mean it. The beast was growing soft it seemed.

Covering up his feelings was something that Marigolddust had gotten used to, and he preferred it far more than sharing his emotions and thoughts.  Although it always made him feel better when he had opportunities to speak to another cat about his feelings, such as when Fernpaw had found him broken down over the loss of his mother, the more relief he felt the more convinced that it was being shared or given completely to the receiver of the words.  It scared him, the idea of causing others to hurt or have conflicted emotions just to get them off of himself, and he never enjoyed the idea of it.  If he had been free of this fear it would have been a completely different story.  But that, unfortunately, wasn&#39;t the case here, and probably wouldn&#39;t be for a long while going forwords.  

            Thinking a lot?  What had she been thinking about?  Perhaps she was overwhelmed by her responsibilities?  Maybe Silentwing had raged some more chaos and more apprentices were being trained by her?  Or was there drama between her and some other cats in the clan?  He could easily see it being the whole Rooksnap ordeal, and would be the opposite of surprised if that turned out to be the case.  <em>I guess a lot of cats were effected by the whole situation...</em> He thought, dread clawing at his chest as it threatened to overwhelm him.  The next sentence quickly concluded his suspicion, or at least hinted at it being more probable.  The offer tempted him to accept it, but he bit his tongue.  It didn&#39;t seem like he had much that needed to be answered, and he didn&#39;t want to take up the deputy&#39;s time with any rambling.</span>

             His expression became soft as he offered a bit of a weak smile.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;m a little worried about a few of the others too,&quot;</em></strong></em> he agreed quietly.  Truthfully, he had only really thought of how the whole conflict had affected Marbledpaw and Rooksnap until now, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel guilty.  Cloverpaw and Blazepaw had both already lost at least two parental figures, and this was just as nother to add to their list.  Personally, this was only his second, and if he felt so poorly about it, then he doubted that the two apprentices felt any better.  Jayfang didn&#39;t seem like he had been all too effected.  The warrior seemed strangely nonchalant for the majority of the time the problem was going on, much more than Marigolddust had expected.  He didn&#39;t know the grey warrior all that well, only that he was good friends with the short brown nanny who&#39;d earned a new injury that day.  

                 <em><strong><em>&quot;It did get pretty messy, didn&#39;t it?&quot;</em></strong></em> He agreed, his voice still barely over a whisper as he struggled to get through all of his thoughts.  Again he felt the want to say something that could give himself some sense of relaxation or cure these negative thoughts and ideas.  This time, though, he made sure he didn&#39;t stop himself.  Reluctantly, he met the odd gaze of Laurelblaze&#39;s.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Do you think I act... Mature enough?  For a warrior, I mean?  Please be honest,&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked, unsure quite how the large she-cat would respond.</span>

Losing family was never easy for anyone, especially if one was particularly close to said family member. She’d lost much of her own in her life, and she knew it would continue as the years passed. Her mother had joined StarClan when she had just been promoted to a warrior, and her father only mere moons ago joined her. Her brothers had left the clan and set out to make lives for themselves in the rogue clans. She didn’t know where Jasper was, but she knew Privetpaw had made a life for himself out in the Fallen Claws as their Healer. She’d lost sisters, brothers, and other family to death’s grip, and one day she knew her time would come to an end. When, she didn’t know, she just knew that she wasn’t ready for it yet. She still had a lot of life left to live, she’d be receiving nine of them in the future anyhow. <em>Hopefully the far-off future, please…</em>

Her gaze of honey-amber and sea-blue met yellow as she listened to his words, tucking her large paws underneath her frame as she grew more comfortable. His question stuck in her mind for a bit, it was hard for her to answer immediately. She still remembered when he and the others were just energetic little kittens, having free-roam of the camp and announcing their presence wherever they went. Yet they all had grown up, they always do, and new kits take their place. Perhaps Rooksnap wasn’t ready to let them go? Insinuating they weren’t mature enough and not acting their age? <em>Hard to imagine though, Marigolddust is one of the more level-headed ones of the young warriors. He puts some of the older ones to shame, definitely me when I was his age.</em> she thought with a slight twitch of her whiskers, before she craned her head over to speak with him once again. <strong>”You?”</strong> she murmured, looking him up and down for a moment. <strong>”You’ve been pretty mature for your age since you were an apprentice. Why do you ask?”</strong> from her own observations, he was a more friendly, easy-going type. Not eager to start useless fights or cause trouble on purpose. Stuff she’d want to see in a warrior she helped oversee. She had a great level of respect for him, he acted with more integrity than she did when she was a young warrior.

Today had been rather eventful, but internally she’d been seething over the fact she actually had a <em>nice</em> conversation with a peer of hers. For once one of these clan cats actually didn’t annoy her to the point where she wanted to cover her ears and scream until it was over. Usually she would try to utilize sarcastic, biting remarks in order to drive others away, however it had the opposite effect on one apprentice. She actually <em>liked</em> talking to him, it drove her nuts!

<em>Stupid clan cats! I should try and get myself exiled or something at this rate, it’d be a whole lot easier than waiting and actually getting to know them, dammit!</em>

Yet she was too much of a coward to, plus it seemed counter-active. Exiles were reserved for the worst of the worst, and while she was a menace to ThunderClan, she wasn’t an outright monster. Viperpaw had some form of a moral compass, she wasn’t evil or anything! Didn’t stop her from insulting others until they left her alone though.

Out of his biological family, Marigolddust bad only lost his youngest sister, his mother, and the father that he had never met, even if he wished he could have.  There were many, many times in his childhood where he had imagined what adventures his father must have gone through.  He had created his own image of who his father was since his mother had never told him anything about him, and every new thing he imagined added to how dearly he wished he could meet him.  Recently, that wish had died down.  He was never visited by whatever tom had contributed to his existence, and didn&#39;t expect to be visited in the future.  He would just have to wait until he himself joined his father in Starclan.  As for his mother, she had seemed like the only cat he looked up to until she became neglective with the loss of Periwinklekit.  He often wondered what it would have been like if his small, frail and ill sister had survived.  Would his mother have made it to his first ceremony?  Would he have been closer to her before she died?  Would he have been able to go with her and somehow prevent loosing her?  Although it wasn&#39;t as common anymore as it once was, these wonders occasionally made their way into the spotlight again.  Bluebellmist had become neglective because she lost a kit, but what was the reasoning for Rooksnap?  It seemed first like it was Beetlestreak&#39;s death, but she hadn&#39;t seemed as close to the medicine cat as he would have expected to cause such a reaction.  So what could it have been?  

             The Tom&#39;s nerves continued to elevate the more he waited.  The suspense didn&#39;t end immediately, but when he finally got his answer he relaxed, even if there was still tension in his position.  He was surprised to hear how Laurelblaze had responded, and wasn&#39;t sure whether to believe her.  After looking at her face closely, he realized she wasn&#39;t lying.  Either that, or she was skilled in hiding it.</span>

             Unable to keep from feeling flattered, his smiled a relieved smile.  If Laurelblaze thought he was mature, then it wouldn&#39;t be very likely that every other cat in the clan would think the opposite.  So... Why had Rooksnap?  Perhaps Laurelblaze&#39;s view had changed, since he had become more close to the deputy than before Rooksnap had become so snappy?  Or maybe it was Rooksnap&#39;s?  Could it be evident that Marigolddust looked up to the deputy more than Rooksnap recently?  Both were confident, but Laurelblaze managed to care and deal with every cat in the clan.  She even remembered the majority of their names!  <em>No, if Rooksnap were jealous she wouldn&#39;t have refused me, would she have?  And why would she get jealous in the first place when she&#39;s cared for so many other cats, too?</em> 

               The question made Marigolddust freeze for a second.  How would he respond?  If he told Laurelblaze that Rooksnap had told him to grow up then he would just be giving the angry warrior another reason to think he was immature.  It would be as if he was snitching on her, and who could consider a snitch grown-up?  He didn&#39;t want to risk it, and therefore tried to avoid pointing paws in the nanny&#39;s direction.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, someone I&#39;m close to recently.... *hinted</em>, to me, that I wasn&#39;t acting as grown up as I should be, that&#39;s all,&quot;*</strong></em> he said with a meek shrug, looking down at his paws and his rabbit as he spoke.</span>

It appeared that Rooksnap&#39;s makeshift family had.. distanced themselves from eachother since their very public confrontation. Even though her reaction wasn&#39;t ideal, she never would&#39;ve taken it as far as Marbledpaw. Of course, when it came to the other adopted daughter, she had grown quite accustomed to being left in the dust. Cloverpaw hadn&#39;t seen anyone - not even Blazepaw - since the confrontation and to put it simply, she preferred not to. Confrontation of feelings didn&#39;t come very easily to a former rogue raised by three individual cats...

Menacing emerald eyes scanning the camp, it was clear the black and white femme was in search of <em>trouble</em>. Not a very rare occurrence when it came to Cloverpaw. Today, though.. she had found some! It was <em>Viperpaw</em>. A newer apprentice, if she remembered correctly, and one of the few cats who had been taken in by someone other than Rooksnap. 

&quot;<strong>Hey, you!</strong>&quot; Clover&#39;s introduction was uh.. uncharacteristic. It would&#39;ve sounded friendly, if she thought she had the empathy to achieve such a thing. &quot;<strong>You&#39;re new, aren&#39;t ya?</strong>&quot; One could only imagine what sort of mischief the former rogue kitten had brewing in her mind...

There was a brief disturbance in the bramble that protected the camp‘s entrance. A sleek dark bengal tom seemingly materialized from the shadows casted by the tall canopy of deciduous trees overhead. The tom was no other than Duskpaw, Gorsebite’s son and final apprentice. The tom, though younger than most of his predecessors had already completed his father’s rigorous traditional training expedition. He was a loyal member of ThunderClan though rather absent in past moon, leading a busy life of training and hunting with his mentor. Despite not being popular for his serious demeanor, his level of skill and talent allowed him a place amongst the top apprentices in ThunderClan -just as his father had expected him to. Still, his modesty stayed intact as he considered his skills useful only when contributing to ThunderClan. 

Truthfully, carrying Gorsebite’s name as both his father and the pinnacle of his mentoring career weighed heavily on the poor boy. He secretly envied a more forgiving and less structured life that allowed him to have more friends and time to himself, but knew this would only come as a disappointment. <em>Soon</em> the tomcat murmured inwardly <em>I’ll be a warrior.. and then I’ll do more of what I want</em> He thought hopefully. 

Even now, as he came to a slow halt in front of the fresh-kill pile, his expression remained solemn, examining what it had to offer. He gave a disdainful sniff at one stale squirrel before deciding that his appetite was unaroused and turned toward a mossy spot next to the apprentice’s den.

<strong>”H-hello?”</strong> The apprentice meowed tentatively from inside the apprentice’s den. Marrowpaw could have sworn that he’d just seen a shadow pass by, maybe it was Viperpaw? The thought of the feisty she-cat made an unexpectedly warm feeling rise in his chest. He would readily admit that she had been quite amusing to talk to despite her usually crass attitude toward anyone other than her siblings. Poking his head out from underneath the den, the gray tom let out a slight breath as he came face to face with Duskpaw who sat wordlessly on top of some moss. 

Marrowpaw’s ears pricked forward with interest. He recognized the dark bengal, knowing he was one of the senior apprentices in the class above them. Rumor had it that he was a fine talent and training under Gorsebite. Even if Marrowpaw was still a bit slow to catching onto names, he was well aware that it was not only his mentor’s mentor, but also the mentor of some of the most prominent figures in ThunderClan. 

<em>I wonder who’s worse... Nightpanther or Gorsebite.</em> He chuckled before realizing that he was awkwardly staring down the other tom. <strong>”Oh.. you’re not Viperpaw..”</strong> Marrowpaw said suddenly feeling hot with embarrassment. <strong>”Duskpaw... isn’t it?”</strong> The tom asked.

The spot printed tom was still lost in his own thoughts as he mindfully reviewed the progressed he’d made with his training today. Hunting? <em>check</em> Laps? <em>check</em> -When suddenly another feline appeared at the entrance. He quietly watched as the other tom spoke first, mentioning the name of Viperpaw. <em>Isn’t that Hollyfrosts and Laurelblaze’s daughter?</em> The tom thought to himself as his eyes narrowed at Marrowpaw. He didn’t recognize the tomcat before him and guessed he was one of the newer apprentices.  <strong>”That would be me.”</strong> Duskpaw replied civilly, wrapping his tail gently over his paws. His tone was neither friendly nor unfriendly, but his resting expression was a tad cold. Duskpaw knew it was a bad habit, but wasn’t entirely sure if he even wanted to be speaking with this newbie anyway. 

<strong>”You must have recently become an apprentice.”</strong> Duskpaw added briskly. <strong>”Otherwise I’d recognize you as well,”</strong> The tom said with a slight murmur in his throat. He glanced up and down wondering what the tomcat might say next and if he had the time to stick around for it. <strong>”Your name?”</strong> The mature apprentice asked, sitting up and folding his shoulders back in an attentive, yet relaxed form.

Marrowpaw couldn’t help but feel a bit smaller and more childish in Duskpaw’s presence. Every word the older tom spoke was sparing, but straight to the point. He watched as Duskpaw elegantly gathered himself, bringing Marrowpaw to do his best to make solid eye contact as he spoke. <strong>”I’m Marrowpaw.”</strong> He introduced, trying to produce his regular friendly exterior. <strong>”And yeah, I did recently become an apprentice. After this week, it’ll be one moon since I started my training.”</strong> He said, offering Duskpaw a smile. 

<strong>”How is it you’re alone right now? This is kind of my first time seeing you in camp.”</strong> This statement was entirely true: Marrowpaw had never seen Duskpaw within the bramble-enforced walls of camp. It felt to him like the other apprentices was always on his feet, busy with something and it made Marrowpaw feel a bit guilty as he wondered about doing the same. Nightpanther would be much more pleased to know that he was being productive. Still, knowing that Duskpaw was associated with Gorsebite the same way Nightpanther had been, made the other tom feel so much older than he truly was.

A light hum escaped Duskpaw’s closed jaw as he learned the new apprentice’s name. His luminescent saffron eyes scanned Marrowpaw’s expression as he continued to speak. <strong>”Hm, it’s a pleasure to meet you then.”</strong> The senior apprentice said with a lighter tone, yet continued to look rather stony. The dark-colored tom felt himself relax a bit as Marrowpaw asked what he was up to by himself. <strong>”I finished some training with my da- mentor so I’m just taking a break.”</strong> Duskpaw said, quickly correcting himself. It always felt so strange to call Gorsebite his father. Sure they were together a lot for learning purposes, but they hardly spent time together outside of lessons. 

The thought that his dad never offered to spend time, suddenly made his tail flick with slight annoyance. He hated the fact that Gorsebite himself wouldn’t acknowledge him as family. Did he even know the meaning of such a word? As far as Duskpaw knew, he absolutely didn’t. <strong>”Who’s your mentor?”</strong> The senior apprentice inquired, now focusing the topic of the conversation on Marrowpaw.

In her eyes, as well as most others, maturity wasn’t necessarily due to age. Sometimes there were adult cats who never truly grew up, keeping up with childish tendencies. Even she had her moments, but she knew she had to be serious and rational in her position as deputy. Goofing off wasn’t part of her job, and she often had to be the adult she was in situations where it was required. Her youthful flames had seemed to fan out into controlled burns at times, her passion for her work hadn’t died down in the slightest. Still, for warriors, they often had trouble finding themselves and who they were in the world. They made mistakes, not able to hold another hand to be led around and told what to do. Freedom came with it’s price, and thus they often had to figure it all out by themselves. Marigolddust seemed to be having that struggle right now, especially since someone just pointed it out to him directly.

<strong>”Well, if anything I was worried you weren’t acting your age when you were younger.”</strong> she flicked an ear as she spoke, shrugging her broad shoulders. He was calm, quiet for a kit and an apprentice, he didn’t do stupid, reckless things most would do at their age. He stayed out of trouble, and perhaps as a result he grew up rather sheltered. Perhaps even a bit of a people-pleaser, she worried that others would walk all over him and he wouldn’t defend himself. She saw how he’d frozen up around Rooksnap, even after she’d stormed off… Might have explained a few things. Her kits she made sure knew how to defend themselves, she didn’t want them to be walking targets. No one was going to take advantage of them, even their kindness. <strong>”You’ve always played it safe, to be honest, and while that’s not a bad thing, I think it might have limited your field of view a bit. When was the last time you did anything stupid just for the hell of it, even if it seems to be a bad idea but would be insanely fun?”</strong> the question was rhetorical, but he was free to answer it if he pleased. These types of experiences helped others get out of their comfort zones, and often they did teach life-long lessons to the participants. Maybe he needed to go out and break out of it a bit, expand his horizons. Knowledge was power after all. <strong>”Also, you’re fretting over what someone else is thinking about you, why? Why do you care so much?”</strong>

As if fate wanted to mock her, one of these stupid clan cats was here to intrude on her time alone yet again. Her crystal-colored gaze flashed a bit as she spotted Cloverpaw, one of the older apprentices here in the clan. Her tufted ears flickered, and she let out a resigned sigh as she answered her question. <strong>”New how? New to the clan? No, I’ve been here for four moons already. New to the apprentice’s den, yes. I’m sure you saw my ceremony, it was a pretty big one.”</strong> her tone was sarcastic as always, almost exasperated at the fact she had to deal with yet another cat getting in her business. Her lips were curled into a slight frown, and she was clearly in a bitter mood at the moment. Talking to her right now might lead to an argument if Cloverpaw hadn’t treaded carefully around her. 

<strong>”You’re Cloverpaw, right? What are you doing wasting your time talking to a new apprentice? Don’t you have friends your age?”</strong> she was quick to start off with a sharp, cutting remark. Maybe that’d get her to back off if she wasn’t thick-skinned and soft. If not, she’d be glad to show off her menagerie of creative and harsh insults. She’d been saving a few for a while and hadn’t gotten the opportunity to use them yet. This might be fun.

<em>Hmm.</em> The black and white she&#39;s face seemingly contorted into one of odd surprise - this was new. The venom laced in her voice was so strangely familiar. Ugh. This cat was <em>like</em> her... <em>Bet my ceremony was bigger.</em> She thought to herself, not one to acknowledge such blatant sarcasm that matched her own. &quot;<strong>Yeah, yeah... you know what I meant.</strong>&quot;

To say the least, Cloverpaw wasn&#39;t surprised that her name was known, clan kits were quite the common gossipers, and they&#39;d often say <em>oh look, it&#39;s that mean rogue kitten that Rooksnap foolishly adopted!</em> Yeah. It got pretty old in the long run. &quot;<strong>I don&#39;t <em>do</em> friends, Vaporpaw.</strong>&quot; She retorted and then seemingly studied the other she-cat up and down. &quot;<strong>What&#39;s your deal anyways? Your mommy not paying enough attention to you?</strong>&quot;

<strong>”The opposite actually, my mothers don’t stop getting in my business. I wonder, if your mother found you speaking to a new apprentice, freshly promoted, like this, she might make you swallow mouse bile for it. If you even have one.”</strong> oh, now <em>that</em> was a low blow even for her standards. Still, Viperpaw had to set the precedent that she was not going to be spoken in such a way unless Cloverpaw was asking for trouble. If they kept this up, they’d only lead to more trouble, and Viperpaw was already getting tired of throwing insults around. Hence why she escalated rather quickly. Perhaps they shouldn’t be destroying each other, they both had a penchant for being sharp-tongued and irritable. Maybe they could combine their powers.

<strong>”Also, it’s VIPERpaw, not Vaporpaw, get it right. Anyways…. You wanna hang out or something? I’m bored.”</strong> she flexed her claws for a moment, staring at the ground as she sat back onto her haunches a bit. Clearly she was fed up with throwing childish insults around when there was no gain to it, she actually liked cats who shared that passion of hers. Showed that not every single one of these insufferably uptight and rule-abiding clan cats weren’t totally lame and soft. Some actually made her laugh with the creativity of their insults, Cloverpaw might be amongst them. She’d never know unless she found out. <strong>”Seriously, this place is so crowded I actually feel claustrophobic. Let’s get out of here, unless you’re scaaaared.”</strong> a challenge, her attitude was quick to change. She always hated staying in camp, and getting out was one of the luxuries she now enjoyed as an apprentice.

The skies were a pallid shade of gray as clouds began to form above the camp, indicating a storm was going to arrive rather soon. Though for Laurelblaze, how she could tell a storm was coming was the smell of water vapor on the air. As if it was a warning to take shelter inside rather soon, yet the skies had only just started to get covered, and not even fully just yet. They still had time before they needed to hide in their dens in case there was thunder and lightning. If not, well a wet pelt wasn’t ideal for anyone. Some of the lazier ones might take it as an opportunity to clean off their pelts and save some time that they’d usually spend grooming it themselves… Not that it really helped much at all. Rain wasn’t going to push debris out of fur, especially if they had thick, messy fur like her own.

The deputy had been lounging outside upon one of the large boulders besides the camp wall. She’d awaited the patrols she’d sent out earlier in the day to return with their hauls of prey, or a report on the situations at various borders. They were lucky that no skirmishes had broken out in quite some time, and she was pleased to notice their coffers of prey had not been growing smaller. The clan was prospering with the season, as oppressive as the heatwaves and thunderstorms were, they made do with what they had and were thriving as a whole. Laurelblaze couldn’t be more proud of them all.

&quot;<strong>Hah! As if my mother cares.</strong>&quot; Came a venomous scoff- of course, she&#39;d only ever known one mother and that she-cat had abandoned her.. Never once had she referred to Rooksnap as a mother. Yet on days like this, Clover wasn&#39;t one to back down, but she&#39;d be lying if she said she wasn&#39;t impressed that Viperpaw had taken it <em>this</em> far already. She obviously wasn&#39;t one to beat around the bush.

With a very clearly surprised and perhaps disgusted expression painted across her face, the scrawny molly simply sat before Viperpaw, almost as if she had passed some hidden test of loyalty. &quot;<strong>What makes you think I &#39;hang out&#39; with others?</strong>&quot; She asked, quite the oddly genuine question. Something about this was strange enough, considering she&#39;d given up on the whole insulting stick. 

&quot;<strong>I am <em>not</em> scared.</strong>&quot; she hissed, clearly annoyed that someone would even insinuate such a thing- <em>Fear</em> wasn&#39;t in Cloverpaw&#39;s vocabulary whatsoever.. or at least that&#39;s what she thought. Clan cats had already been putting a target on her back since her scuffle with Marbledpaw when they were no more than mere kittens. &quot;<strong>Challenge me, then.. I&#39;ll show ya how scared I am.</strong>&quot;

The day was bright and sunny out, a perfect day to get out into the woods and spend time with her apprentices and actually train. She typically kept their lessons separate for their own sake, being able to dedicate time to each of them so they could go over what they’d learned in the day and so neither of them fell behind. Besides, Bouncepaw was older than Tigerpaw and therefore farther along in her training compared to the much younger molly. Laurelblaze had to make sure she was ready for her warriors’ assessment. Six moons seemed like a long time, but before any of them knew it, it arrived. It was her duty as their mentor to make sure they were up to snuff, and she put them both through the wringer.

Speaking of which, there was one of her little students now… Idling around in camp it seemed. <em>Can’t blame her, not like they can go out without a kitsitter practically.</em> she let out a small sigh as she approached the young she-cat with a small smile. <strong>”Hey, Bouncepaw.”</strong> she greeted her apprentice with a small dip of her skull, her tail flickering around behind her as she approached. <strong>”You busy? I was wondering if you wanna go hunting for a bit, get out of camp, no?”</strong>

Well, even if she said no, they needed to get some training in. Though Laurelblaze wanted to start her off with something easy, nothing too grueling. A warm-up, essentially, for what was to come later on. <strong>”Come on, while it’s still light out! We can get so much done today!”</strong>

Well, it seemed her little jab at her courage worked, Cloverpaw was willing to leave camp with her. A satisfied smirk appeared upon her features, ice-blue gaze glinting as she nodded. <strong>”Fine, I’m sure you’re just a little scaredy-kit.”</strong> she chuckled under her breath, before rising to her petite paws. The small black tortoiseshell molly began to make her way over towards the camp exit, her gait regal and purposefully elegant. She’d always liked to show off a bit, but Viperpaw always was the type to showcase poise in all her movements.

She glanced back to see whether Cloverpaw was following behind her, and she had a few questions for the older apprentice. The molly heard she had a bit of a mixed reputation, and she was curious. Checkered pasts amongst clan cats weren’t common, at least from the cats she met— not that she got to know many very well. This cat actually seemed somewhat interesting. <strong>”So, you do anything for fun around here? Besides being rude to apprentices younger than you.”</strong> her cocky grin didn’t leave her face as she turned back to speak to the older apprentice. Truly, she was curious, her main hobbies mostly included scowling menacingly at people she didn’t want to talk to or giving them a loud berating for everyone to hear.

What else would the creamish tan and brown she-cat do? Possibly socialize but this femme had been itching to get out of camp. <strong>&quot; Laurelblaze! It&#39;d be my pleasure.&quot;</strong> she responded with a bit of exaggeration. Being as though her warrior assessment was not too too far away, though it seemed that way, she had to practice and make sure she would not mess up. Her confidence grew day by day, although her footwork needed more work as her sense of direction could be wobbly, she had gotten stronger and trusted herself more. Nodding before giving her mentor a ready and determined smile. <strong>&quot; Where are we off to this sunrise?&quot;</strong> she asked curiously, wanting to know what her mentor had planned or any ideas really.

Even though she was clearly frustrated, the older apprentice was beginning to see that instead of <em>causing</em> the trouble, she was waltzing right into it. A fairly played trick if she was being honest, as only kits would argue over who wasn&#39;t scared... It was a fleeting moment of embarrassment for an apprentice of her reputation. Although, she had to admit, Viperpaw had the spirit it took to survive her insults. 

Curiously, she watched the younger feline strut towards the camp entrance and she scoffed slightly, but reluctantly followed anyways. &quot;<strong>No one has <em>deserved</em> any nice words from me,</strong>&quot; It was a stern reminder, and after the whole scene last week with Rooksnap, she strongly stood by her own words. It was also then that Clover happened to realize something - had she <em>ever</em> had fun before? Oh gosh. She blankly stared and Viperpaw and her face contorted in annoyance yet again.

Bouncepaw she never had any trouble with when it came to handling training. The young molly was always ready to handle what she threw at her, she liked that she was prepared at all times. She’d had challenging apprentices in the past, but Bouncepaw made things nice and easy for her. Even if she didn’t get things first try and wasn’t perfect in all her ministrations, Laurelblaze understood that would be like achieving the impossible. All she wanted from her apprentices was them doing their best efforts at getting something done. It was her job as a mentor to teach them how to get it done the proper way and to help them achieve what they needed to do in order to become a fully-fledged warrior.

The large, russet-toned tortoiseshell had begun to lead her apprentice out of the camp exit, her bushy tail trailing behind her. The gargantuan femora crouched down to fit herself through the small tunnel that led out into the forest surrounding their camp, crawling through the space as she had done many times before. Once she finally had exited and stepped out into the clearing surrounding the walls of their camp, she stopped to check to see if her apprentice had been following behind her. They’d be headed towards their territory by the WindClan border for this hunting session.

The words were initially mistaken for a hint that he hadn&#39;t been very mature when he was younger, but after a few moments of his worry elevating he realized what Laurelblaze must have meant.  If what he had originally took the words to mean had been their true intention, then it would have gone against what Laurelblaze had said only moments before.  He never thought that a cat could be too mature, and thought the more mature someone was, the better others thought of them.  Immaturity had been more of a fear of his than the opposite, although even if he were to start worrying about it now it would be too late.  According to Laurelblaze, he acted well for his age, so wasn&#39;t that all that he needed for reassurance?  

           Marigolddust had noticed other cats going through things like what he was, and he often tried to think of ways that he might help them.  He always came short, but he had never connected that with the idea that he was going through the same thing.  If was hard, for him at least, to identify things like that.  He knew who didn&#39;t seem to be going through doubts and who did most of the time, and he usually wished he could have things more figured out like cats such as Laurelblaze seemed to.  The idea that this meant he hadn&#39;t figured out whether he felt mature enough, though?  Never before had that come to him.</span>

              Marigolddust had known for awhile that he might have been playing everything he did safe, but that was fine with him.  As long as it kept him out of danger and prevented him from getting hurt... Even if he often got harmed in some way, shape, or form anyways, he was okay with it.  Fear was a constant drive behind his actions, even though he didn&#39;t always appreciate it.  The question made his mind crank and turn.  <em>When <em><strong>was</strong></em> the last time I&#39;ve done something stupid for fun?</em> He wondered, frowning as he realized he couldn&#39;t think back on any situation of the sort.  Sure, he&#39;d broken the rules... Maybe three times, although one had just been risky while the others had been actually against the rules.  But the first time it had been pushed on him, even if it did turn out being fun until it resulted in him falling from a tree, the second wasn&#39;t at all for fun, and the third... He shivered just thinking of it.  Otherwise he had stuck to the laws of the clan, never stepping more than a paw out of the boundaries he followed.  She didn&#39;t mean rule-breaking specifically, though, did she?  <em><strong><em>&quot;It doesn&#39;t seem like things turn out very well when cats do that,&quot;</em></strong></em> he pointed out, although the question had clearly gotten him thinking.  

           The last question was one that he occasionally found himself thinking during situations like this; why did he care?  In truth, he had no idea.  Sometimes, like this time, he cared because he was close to the cats who said such things.  In other situations, he didn&#39;t quite know.</span>

               Perhaps it was because it seemed a cat&#39;s identity was affected by those who observed them, although maybe it was for some other reason he didn&#39;t understand yet.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well... There&#39;s a lot of cats, and it&#39;s good to have.. criticism?&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, the statement a bit weak as he grew unsure of the words.  What was someone supposed to do when others stated what they thought about them?  It was like advice, wasn&#39;t it?  You listened to what others said about you, and then you altered that &quot;problem&quot; so that it fit what cats thought they were supposed to be.  Oh, how terrible that mindset sounded now that he thought about it!  But how else would a cat feel?  He was confused, embarrassed, and maybe a bit shameful at the idea that he figured this all out in the wrong way.</span>

A wide grin spread over his cheeks and, mouse still in his mouth, the young apprentice took off towards her. <strong>&quot;Hi Laurelblafe&quot;</strong> A mouthful of fur muffled his greeting.

When she was a young warrior, around Marigolddust’s age, she was a hotshot, a total spitfire looking to cause as much trouble as she could. The power that came with being a warrior easily went to her head and gave her an inflated ego. She believed she was invincible, able to take on any challenges life threw at her. Laurelblaze picked pointless fights, and engaged in reckless behavior just to show off to the others. Not only that, but she was absolutely one of the most arrogant and cocky warriors the clan might have ever seen. It was because of this behavior that she’d cultivated a rather bad reputation for herself when she was young, she was a troublemaker. She stirred up problems wherever she could, just so she could prove to the others she could solve them and therefore do anything. The tortoiseshell now was mortified by this behavior of hers back then, looking back on it always made her cringe from embarrassment, it was utterly horrific. Fortunately for her, she was humbled rather quickly… Or perhaps not so fortunately, much of it came from learning that she <em>wasn’t</em> in fact invincible, and that she too could be hurt, and that she wasn’t immune to suffering. These experiences shaped her into the warrior she was now, one that dedicated herself to her clan. One that protected her clanmates with her life. One whose loyalty was unfettering and powerful. All because she <em>learned</em> from them, and still had room to grow from her experiences. She was never going to achieve perfection, and she’d take her experiences from being deputy of her clan into account for the future. 

Perhaps that was why Marigolddust was questioning himself. While she didn’t advise that he go ahead and make mistakes on purpose, perhaps he was missing out on a few things. He needed to find his confidence, to have the ability to lift himself up. Learn to truly defend oneself when their character was questioned. <strong>”You’re your own cat, Marigolddust. Other cats shouldn’t dictate how you should change for them to like you. In truth, not everyone will, but you shouldn’t let them tell you how you should live your life… Unless you’re doing something completely nuts and bad, maybe listen to them then, but I don’t think you have that sort of problem.”</strong> she shrugged her shoulders as she flicked an ear, her gaze drifting down to the tuxedo tom with a small smirk. Yet here she was, giving him advice on how to go about his life. All she wanted was for him to grow a spine a bit, to not let anyone walk all over him. He shouldn’t be a total pushover, it’d make life a lot more miserable if he let everyone tel him what to do or bullied him into submission. <strong>”You’re really quick to let others tell you what to do. If they say anything rude to you, you need to tell them they’re a mousebrained crow-food eater and need to buzz off. Got it? Don’t let others push you around, especially when you know what they’re saying isn’t true in the slightest. And that’s an order.”</strong>

Well, it seemed one of the patrols was right on time to return, one of her own kits among them. Seeing Foxpaw brought a smile to her heavily-scarred features, lopsided but ever so genuine. The russet-toned tortoiseshell looked down at the mouse her son had brought to her, a pleased purr escaping as she acknowledged the successful hunt with a firm nod. <strong>”That’s great, Foxpaw!”</strong> she sounded proud, and why shouldn’t she be? Her kits were excelling in their training, and as a parent she was absolutely beaming at the sight of them doing so well in their endeavors. The deputy couldn’t wait to see how they’d progress further into their training, it was ever-so exciting for her. She’d worried about them as kits, but she always fretted over her children when they began their apprenticeships. It was never easy letting go of those cute little kittens, but she knew they needed to grow up eventually and have their own adventures. Still, she was glad her son decided to stop by and talk to her, and give her updates about his progress. <strong>”Pretty soon, I’m sure you’re gonna be chasing down rabbits into their warrens, huh? Or catching squirrels in the trees? Better show me those catches when you do, I wanna see!”</strong>

A great big yawn stretched Icestar’s jaws wide open, revealing a set of sharp canines that glistened in the light that managed to filter through the thin blanket of clouds that gloated by. The trees bristled gently with the wind, sending a thin spray of water from this sunrise’s shower raining down upon the lynx-point. She squeaked in surprise but didn’t mind the dampening of her pelt. Afterall, she was Nightstorm’s daughter.

Padding down from her position on the Highledge, Icestar entered the camp clearing. Her feathery tail flicked back and forth gently, taking in the pleasant scenery of Clan activity. Young apprentices and kits scuffled in the mud while the older trainees scowled disapprovingly. Warriors weaved through the dens, busying themselves with daily activities. Queens chattered and helped with reinforcing the dens with thicker material to prevent the rain from soaking through. Icestar watched their expert work before flitting her gaze over to the entrance.</span>

The grey and white she padded into camp carrying a vole and a mouse. She put it down in the fresh kill pile and then padded over to just outside the apprentice den and shook her fur. She hated being wet but she had been told to hunt, and so she had. She hadn’t been super successful, but at least she had caught a couple pieces of prey. She sat down to clean herself and sighed, she was behind in her training. <span class="mention" title="Iceywicey#3780">@Ice</span> (don’t kill me, I’ll change my apps name if you want lol)</span>

She longed for the openness of the territory. Staying in camp had never been a favourable activity. Making her way towards the familiar tangle of thorns that made up the entrance, Icestar prepared to slip into it, only to jerk to a halt as an apprentice surprised her. <em>That damned rain!</em> She thought with annoyance. Besides wiping away any smell in its path, its own thick scent overwhelmed the others. 

Recovering from nearly knocking into the smaller femme, she turned to apologize only to find her gone. Narrowing her eyes, Icestar searched, finding her dropping the catches into the pile. <em>Hadn’t she noticed her own leader?</em> The lynx-point thought, flicking a dark ear in irritation. However, Icepaw’s facial expression was quite contorted. <em>Is she preoccupied with something?</em> Is that why she wasn’t paying attention to her surroundings?</span>

She hadn’t noticed her leader as she was indeed preoccupied with her thoughts. She continued cleaning herself. <em>I’ll never become a warrior at this rate. If I everyone is busy training their own apprentices or busy with other things, I’ll never get there. I’ll never be one of them. Especially since they won’t let me train with their apprentices.</em> She sighed as she finished cleaning herself. She scanned the camp. Perhaps she would go back out and practice by herself.

The idea of being completely in control of who he was seemed like something that, although it sounded as if it were true, was really false.  Cats changed according to their surroundings all of the time, such as a kitten getting sick from a undiagnosed sickness and the mother turning cold because of the loss.  The way that others changed changed you.  If a cat were to be attacked often, they would naturally grow more cautious and untrusting.  So, if a cat got positive feedback from others, they would most often stay the same or feel more confident.  If this were a negative case, than it would effect the cat poorly and cause them to want to change and become insecure.  Wasn&#39;t that just the way of life, though?  Events always made something change or shift inside someone, and the events of honest speaking couldn&#39;t hardly escape this.  He was just a cat who received a bit too much negative feedback in his past and life currently.  Didn&#39;t that mean it was natural to become unsure about it?  But, if that was the case, then he didn&#39;t understand why so many others in the clan seemed to feel so confident in themselves.  Surely they must have received negative comments too, right?  Every cat did, so they must have.  Then why weren&#39;t they thinking like him; doubting, thinking, and believing?  Didn&#39;t they ever feel the way that he did now?</span>

           Maybe they had and he just failed to realize it.  It wouldn&#39;t be too surprising, taking his inability (or refusal) to take in the changes going on around him to consideration.  He had never been a fan or things changing or moving on.  If he could, he would stop time as it was, keeping everything the same so that he didn&#39;t need to fear the future or what it would bring.  Perhaps he would even try to fix some things that have gone wrong, such as Rooksnap&#39;s new found temper or Fernpaw&#39;s loneliness.  Enough of that thinking, though.  He had to keep his mind on the topic that was being discussed and that target alone.  Glancing over Laurelblaze once more, he took her role in his story into consideration.  He aspired to be as confident or sure of himself as her, so why was he finding himself not trusting what she said?  He wished he could have her sureness, and she was like this partly because she didn&#39;t mind what others thought of her.  Hearing Laurelblaze&#39;s question echo through his head, he realized that instead of the deputy&#39;s voice, he heard his own self consciousness wondering.  Why <em>did</em> he care?  There was really no reason to, was there?  

             The tortoiseshell&#39;s sequence of insults brought Marigolddust to attention, catching him off guard.  He couldn&#39;t conceal the surprise and startement on his face at her words.  The &#39;order&#39; part of it was just as unexpected as the rest.  Although he knew that it wasn&#39;t completely serious, and he&#39;d <em>hopefully</em> not be punished too badly for disobeying this &#39;order&#39;, it still managed to make him a little nervous.  This didn&#39;t prevent him from voicing some form of objection, though.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I-isn&#39;t that a bit rude?&quot;</em></strong></em> He stammered, stunned.  He could never see himself repeating the words, and wasn&#39;t a cat supposed to respond to rudeness with polite matters?  Wasn&#39;t that how things didn&#39;t elevate to anything too much worse?</span>

It appeared as if something was bothering the apprentice. The unfocused glaze of the eyes as she had begun to groom her fur. The perplexed expression on her face as she stared into empty space. <em>Since when had the ground become more interesting than ThunderClan’s very own leader?</em> The lynx-point cocked her head to the side with a small frown. Abandoning her original pursuit, she made her way over to Icepaw.

<em>Is something the matter?</em> She stopped right in front of the smaller feline, her figure blocking the cast of the sun. Icestar’s elongated shadow stretched right up to the camp wall, becoming disfigured by the rough terrain. Was she intimidating? Yes but not by her figure. In fact, her size was just that of the average warrior. It was her confident stance and blazing eyes that startled many. 

<strong>” You look as if you’re bothered,”</strong> she added in a softer tone.</span>

She had just finished cleaning her fur when a large figure stood over her. She looked up to see her leader in front of her. Her eyes widened. What was her leader doing standing in front of her? She dipped her head respectfully. <strong>&quot;Good morning Icestar. It’s no big deal. I was just a little worried about getting behind in my training.&quot;</strong> she responded quietly, intimidated by her, and the fact that her leader was talking to her.

The twin she-kits bounded about camp, breaking it’s peaceful quietness as they wrestled and played with each other. Their matching ruddy and white pelts blended with one another as Emberkit pounced on top of Cinderkit, sparring with each other for a few moments before running off again. 
Squeals and playful yowls echoed around the quarry as one sister chased after the other. So absorbed in their game, they didn’t even notice as their paws trampled over a napping clanmate’s tail.
Rowdy like troublemakers, they were still able to cling to the unmistakable air of innocence kits were entitled to. 

It wasn’t long before they bumped into a second clanmate- this one more their size. 
<strong>”EEK!”</strong> shouted one of the girls, digging their paws into the ground as a desperate attempt to halt herself before tumbling headfirst into Seakit.

<em>Worried that you might get behind in training?</em> Was her mentor not training her enough? Icestar scowled, looking around. Unfortunately, she couldn’t spot Icepaw’s mentor from anywhere. Sea-green eyes looked back to the startled apprentice, raising a nonexistent eyebrow. <strong>” Where’s your mentor? Wasn’t he out with you just now?”</strong> Surely, she hadn’t gone out alone which Icestar had forbidden all apprentices. 

The dark tip of her feathery tail twitched and the silvery-white molly cast a quick glance to the tempting entrance of the camp. <strong>” Why don’t you come with me then? I can show you a few moves that could impress your mentor.”</strong> While it hadn’t been long since she had done battle training with Hollyfrost and Bearmask in preparation for that spar with Laurelblaze, it will still prove beneficial to both parties.</span>

Seakit had been entranced by a toad that had unfortunately stumbled across the camp clearing. Large ocean-coloured eyes - just like his mother’s - observed the fat creature with great interest. A small paw snaked out to pat the back of the frightened toad, black paw pads feeling the bumpy and dry texture of this toad’s skin. The toad, startled by the gentle squishing, hopped forward to escape any further contact. 

The gray-and-brown tabby lowered his body clumsily in an attempt to mimic a hunter’s crouch. He wriggled his haunches, preparing to hop after the toad, only to give a surprised shout as two of his Clanmates barreled right into body.

<strong>” Oof!”</strong> His face slammed into the muddy dirt. Seakit tasted soil in his mouth and felt his temper shoot upwards skyhigh. Puffing out his kit fur with the attempt of bold intimidation, he rose up to his paws and glared at the disturbers.

She’d always exuded confidence wherever she went, it was like that since she was born. Supposedly she was strong even upon birth, gaining not only the attention of her family, but any onlookers as well. Laurelblaze had carried herself with a regal stride wherever she went, always staring up at the Highledge as if it were a symbol of her lofty goals. Yet looking back on it, they weren’t so far out of reach now. Not everyone had that same level of confidence, however, it was clear by the way she saw how Marigolddust was doubting himself. He needed to find his footing, a way to figure out that he would be okay. That he was going to be a successful warrior and prove it to any naysayers. That was the thing about their clan, they valued courage and loyalty above all else. Confidence, in a way, could be lumped in with courage, and her clan could be a hard bunch to please.

Maybe he needed a chance to prove himself, that he did change for the better. That he was a warrior of his clan and was proud of it, and that he had matured into this role.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His surprised reaction to her rather uncouth and vulgar phrasing of an insult towards anyone trying to mess with him made her let out a deep roar of laughter. She threw her head back and let out a set of hearty chuckles before she took a deep breath and composed herself again. It was always hilarious to her to see the reactions of her clanmates to her encouraging them rather aggressively. Admittedly, it was part of the reason why she did it, just to startle them a bit. They were used to her kind yet professional persona, but she wasn’t afraid to be a little casual around them and use some language their parents told them not to use. What were they going to do, call the <em>deputy</em> a bad influence on their kits? The audacity they would have had to do so! Once she’d calmed down a bit, she stared at the younger tom with a wide grin, <strong>”And them insulting you isn’t? It’s self-defense, stand up for yourself Marigolddust. Don’t hold back either, make them think twice before insulting you again. What I said before is nothing compared to some of the things I’ve said to others.”</strong> she could be rather hurtful if she wanted to. Not that she chose to, but she wasn’t going to let others walk all over her. She wanted to make sure he knew to not let anyone treat him that way either. He was Marigolddust, a warrior of ThunderClan, not some meek kittypet addicted to eating dry, bland food that looked like rabbit droppings.

They weren&#39;t alone anymore. 

Foxpaw wiggled excitedly on the floor, going through his hunting moves as he continued to clammer on. <strong>&quot;It never saw me coming. I was like&quot;</strong> A pause so he could adjust himself steadily. <strong>&quot;Then I was like&quot;</strong> Ginger and white hurled into the air. <strong>&quot;And I got it in my jaws! I felt the vibrations of the little paws in my own! And then I used that help me catch it&quot;</strong> Being half-deaf, the poor apprentice couldn&#39;t realise how loud he was. <strong>&quot;I&#39;ll be chasing down all those little guys! Nothing can escape from master hunter Foxpaw!&quot;</strong>

The old Foxkit could never imagine standing in front of the deputy and reenacting his greatest catch. Just a few weeks ago, he had complained to Wrenpaw -then Wrenkit - that he would never be an apprentice. 

How the tables have turned.

The deputy was filled with utter joy that her kits were doing so well in the clan now. Foxpaw especially was excelling, she couldn’t be more proud of her son in this moment. The burly tortoiseshell was glad he was so eager about his training and something that would become so routine as a hunting patrol. That enthusiasm reminded her of when she was his age, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Now her kits were making her feel old, even if she was in her prime and would still be for quite a bit. All of her children had a habit of making her feel old.

<strong>”You’re doing wonderful, Foxpaw. I’m so proud of you.”</strong> she doted upon her kits equally, but she couldn’t help but to feel utter joy at the fact she was witnessing their achievements first-hand. She felt so lucky, though she still worried about them. Every day they entered the forest, not knowing what might happen. She’d seen how cruel the world could be to someone, how they could meet terrible fates because they weren’t careful. Laurelblaze knew that <em>very</em> well. <strong>”If you ever catch some voles, save me one. They’re my favorite.”</strong> she nudged his shoulder with one of her large paws, almost as if she was signaling to him to get the hint for next time. Now she was not going to abuse her power as deputy and as a mother, it was merely just a suggestion. <strong>”By the way, I’ve been meaning to ask. What’s your favorite prey anyways? Just curious.”</strong> her motives were pretty obvious, but she felt a mini celebration was in order in the future. They’d have to get the family all together for this, this was monumental!

Or she could just gift him his favorite prey that she caught herself. Just to show him he had her full support no matter what.

She arched a delicate eyebrow. <em>Hasn’t seen her mentor since the ceremony?</em> Icestar was going to have a chat with that warrior but for the meantime, she was going to squeeze some training in for Icepaw. <em>It’s a shame Featherpaw isn’t around…</em> It would’ve been nice to get her own apprentice to join. However, he was out with the other apprentices. Today was going to have to stick to being a one-on-one. 

<strong>” Let’s go then.”</strong> Turning around, Icestar <em>finally</em> managed to slip through the thorn tunnel. She had been yearning for this for too long! The moment they reached the other side, it was a whole new world filled with space and fresh air and freedom. Just how she liked it. Glancing back at the apprentice while starting the trek up to the top of the stone hollow, she assessed Icepaw. <em>It’d be best to start with basic hunting crouches.</em> Battle-training would have to be for another day.</span>

She smiled gratefully at Icestar. <strong>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</strong> she responded as she followed her leader out of camp. She had tagged along with other training sessions and so had at least learned how to hunt, which is how she was able to come back to camp with prey just a little while ago.

The booming laughter that exited Laurelblaze&#39;s chest made the young tom jump, although once he realized that she was laughing a confused smile crossed his features.  He would have tried to excrete a laugh or chuckle to accompany the deputy&#39;s, but he was thoroughly not understanding what she was laughing at.  Wasn&#39;t it normal to feel surprised when your deputy told you to spit a bunch of insults at any cat who was being rude to you?  If it wasn&#39;t, than other cats were more odd than he originally expected.  

           Physical self defense was always the first thing that came to the warrior&#39;s head when self defense was mentioned.  He never really thought of insulting a cat back or standing up for himself as other cats thought he should was really a form of defense, just an exchange of offense.  Weren&#39;t they the same thing, though?  If it was, then how could he be sure that insulting the offender would be strong enough of a defense to truly make them doubt whether they should insult or judge him again?  He tried to imagine a situation where he was standing up for himself for once, but his heart just didn&#39;t seem to believe that he was capable of doing such a thing.  <em><strong><em>&quot;So... you&#39;re sure that it&#39;d work?  How am I supposed to be sure when I should say... *that</em>... to another cat?&quot;*</strong></em> he asked.  Marigolddust didn&#39;t want to slip up and end up being the first to throw a punch, even though he doubted he would be able to throw a punch in the fight at all.</span>

             He went silent for a few moments before thinking over what she had said again.  An opportunity to change the subject showed itself, and Marigolddust felt the urge to ask this question not only because of that but because of pure curiosity.  <em><strong><em>&quot;When did *you</em> need to stand up for yourself?&quot;*</strong></em> he asked.  He could never even imagine anybody being rude towards Laurelblaze.  She was gigantic in both size, confidence, and position, anyways.  Was she talking about the earlier days when she didn&#39;t have the position she had now?  Or did some cats really have that much courage?  If they did, then he might have been even more doomed than he had thought before.</span>

The young tom padded out of the warrior&#39;s den, yawning. They thought for a moment, wondering what they could do for the day. As their amber eyes searched around the camp, they landed on the apprentices den. Something seemed to tug at their brain as their gaze lingered blankly on the den. <em>Oh! Right! Coyotepaw!</em> The silvery warrior remembered their apprentice, and began searching for the young cat. Maybe they could finally go on a training session.</span>

The young apprentice had been resting in his nest, dealing with a mixture of both being awake, yet asleep at the same time. He always was a bit of a slow riser, not necessarily because he didn’t get enough sleep, but he naturally had to push himself to get out of his nest in the morning. It was a struggle he had to cope with for the entirety of his life, and he always prevailed, so far. Blinking his leaf-green gaze open, the pale-brown tabby pointed tom picked his head up from his paws and hauled himself out of his nest. He padded out of the apprentice’s den awkwardly, his lanky legs practically dragging themselves across the ground as he stepped into the camp. The feeling of the sun’s warm rays against his pelt felt refreshing, helping sharpen his drowsy senses until he was able to pick his head up without feeling the urge to sprawl out across the ground and sleep for a few hours. No, Coyotepaw knew he needed to work today, it was evident by the presence of his mentor searching for him. <strong>”Morning, Strikethroat.”</strong> the apprentice greeted his silvery mentor with a flick of his tail, rubbing his eyes. His voice sounded tired, still laced with the effects of sleepiness. He hoped to work it off soon, once they got out into the forest today, he was sure it would be all right.

The silver cat spotted their apprentice, who was sleepily dragging his paws out of the den. <strong>&quot;Hello, Coyotepaw! &quot;</strong> They mewed, noticing how their apprentice seemed to be incredibly tired. <strong>&quot;Do you want to go out for training today? You seem... Tired. &quot;</strong> They mewed, head tilted. The young warrior looked at the tom, thinking. <strong>&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to sleep a bit more...? &quot;</strong></span>

In all honesty he wasn’t truly tired, he had a good night’s rest and was ready to take on the day. He just took a little while to get his head on straight after a long rest, he’d be fine momentarily. <strong>”I’m ready for training when you are. I just woke up, I’m completely fine.”</strong> he reassured his mentor with a small nod, his expression neutral as he glanced towards the camp exit. No time like the present, anyhow, they’d need to get training done anyways. Why not get it done now so they could get it over with? He didn’t mind at all. <strong>”Let’s just go, if I go back to my nest now, I might never get up today. The earlier the better.”</strong> he really just wanted his free-time later, nothing like cutting his problems at the root so they wouldn’t come back and bite him in the rear. StarClan knows he just wanted to go off and sort his collections here and there. Once he got all his work done, he would be free to do so!

Well, well, the conversation was growing a bit interesting! In the past, it was rare she ever really needed to stand up for herself. She was a giant warrior, still is of course, and tended to startle others with her mere presence. She was powerful, and didn’t let anyone talk down to her, often without having to even say a word. However, that didn’t mean she did not speak up for herself, defending her honor to the others. The tortoiseshell had often had to speak up on her own behalf in the early days of her time as deputy, particularly against the same group of cats who’d repeatedly criticized her. Her features curled into a small smile, and a light, half-hearted chuckle escaped her lips. <strong>”You remember Shiversight? Their entire family? They left right around when you were a young apprentice.”</strong> she asked the tom with a flicker of one of her tufted ears, curious as to whether the tom ever met any of them. Shiversight, a skeletal, yet once prominent member of their clan. She could never forget the times he’d insulted her, openly bad-mouthing her orders or decisions… Great StarClan, she <em>hated</em> that tom, even with the littlest of choices she’d made he found some way to complain about it. She was sure if she’d given him some prey back then as a friendly gesture he’d refuse it out of spite. <em>Crotchety old weasel.</em>

She’d straightened out her posture and ruffled her thick coat a bit, letting out a deep exhale as she was about to recount the various tales of the run-ins she’d had with that family. <strong>”His son and I used to get along swimmingly, actually. For a while I actually considered him my closest friend. Though when I was getting more closely involved with the leadership of the clan I think it caused some resentment to build up… Onionslice believed I was chasing power and was being granted it from nepotism, all because my father was a well-respected warrior and his family wasn’t seen as such.”</strong> her pupils narrowed a bit, she hated when he brought up her father in their conversations. Featherpelt and her existed as separate entities, and she actually took more closely after her mother if anything! Laurelblaze worked her hardest to get where she was at, and for him to throw it in her face still made her blood boil to this day. <strong>”That was the downfall to our friendship, and he and I could not stop bickering back then. I often had to tell him off and to stop wallowing in self-pity… His father also didn’t like me, but for separate reasons. I had quite a few verbal spats with him before, his favorite way to refer to me was Dog Deputy…”</strong> her eyes darkened a bit, and she felt her jaw clench. That stung, it was a deep wound for her, the memory of the attack that left her permanently scarred and nearly on the brink of death was not one she was going to have mocked. The first time he ever called her that she was close to outright attacking him for that, but she kept her control, even if she felt nothing but pure rage at that. He had no right going there.

Today was a day bursting with life. Greenleaf was slowly coming to an end but the environment showed no signs of it. Crickets hummed amidst the undergrowth. Squirrels dashed from branch to branch. Birds fluttered together in the air and the forest was as green as green can be. Lush leaves bristled gently in the wind, glinting different viridescent shades. Only the blazing sun in the sky made this possible.

Icestar glanced up at it from her spot on the Highledge. Feathery tail flicked gently to and fro as she took in the warmth and brightness for a heartbeat or two before sending her teal gaze back onto the congregation that began to form in the clearing. For good measure - to get the rest of the stragglers out -, Icestar called loudly: <strong>” All those who are old enough to catch their own prey, gather around to celebrate the making of a new warrior!”</strong>

Once most of the Clan had settled, the lynx-pointed ThunderClan leader looked upon the sole apprentice that will guard the camp tonight. Bringing her eyes to face the strong sun, the ceremony commenced. 

<strong>” I, Icestar of ThunderClan,”</strong> she began in a powerful voice. <strong>” Call upon my warrior ancestors to look down on this apprentice. They have trained hard to understand the ways of your noble code, and I commend them to you as a warrior in their turn.”</strong> 

Sea-green hues once again met the tom who stood before her. Was he nervous or excited? She couldn’t quite tell at the moment considering she was concentrating on emitting the traditional words. 

<strong>” Acepaw, do you promise to uphold the warrior code and to protect and defend your Clan, even at the cost of your life?”</strong> One of the most important questions a warrior receives in their life and few actually feel the weight of it.

The name Shiversight was well familiar to the two-tones tom by now, even though he had never seen the the tom in person or had the chance to speak to him.  He didn&#39;t know any members of his family either, at least not to his knowledge.  It was unbeknownst to him that Shrikecatcher was a member of the infamous Shiny family, and otherwise his thoughts remained true.  He hardly knew any of the other members names, even though he had once shared his best friend with one of the members as a kit.  Learning of families that he wasn&#39;t currently close to wasn&#39;t exactly something that Marigolddust exercised often.  He hardly knew any of Laurelblaze&#39;s family members, which only showed off just how terrible he was at remembering cats he had never before met.  It was impossible to forget Shiversight and his family, though.  It was rare that any Thunderclanner older than an experienced apprentice didn&#39;t know the group who had left Thunderclan fairly recently.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Ive never met them, to be honest, but I know of them,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, curiousity and hesitation showing strong on his face as he said the words.  His eyes were locked onto the amber and blue ones the deputy had.  He was interested in the story that she had to tell, although he wasn&#39;t sure where this conversation was going.  Had the Shiny family had something against the massive tortoiseshell?  Why would they?  She was friendly, and made it clear more than a few times that she would die for her clan.  So why, then, did any clan member have reason to look down on her?  Metaphorically, of course.  He wasn&#39;t sure if any cat could do it physically.  

              You could hear nothing but silence from the young warrior as he listened intently to Laurelblaze&#39;s story.  Although it wasn&#39;t at all common for the tom, he was curious as to what the other members of the family were like.  <em>Onionslice?</em></span>

               The name was unfamiliar to his ears, which pricked up a little higher at the sound of it.  Now that he had heard the title after a little bit of background, it sounded like more of a sour name than it might have otherwise.  What close friend would do such a thing?  A friend was supposed to understand, right?  It seemed uncharacteristic for family statis to get in the way of it, but then again he wasn&#39;t one to speak.  Although his family barely had a name for itself within the clan, neither did the majority of those of his friends&#39;.  He had no reason to be jealous of any of them, and would much rather forget those he was related to through blood and replace them with those he truly felt close to.  Even though Marigolddust had these thoughts about what was said this far, he didn&#39;t speak any of them outloud.  He didn&#39;t want to interrupt Laurelblaze, and expected a story like this would need some space.  His own words seemed like they would only crowd them, and that wasn&#39;t his intention as the listener.  

               At the sound of the rude nickname, Marigolddust tensed.  Although he had kept it secret by everyone besides himself and Tigerpaw, he has had his own run in with a dog before, and all he could think of to explain it was <em>&#39;panic&#39;</em>.  Dogs were not something that should be joked about, and he knew that from experience.  At least he still had his pelt, though that was the only upside to the whole ordeal.  It seemed like much too toxic and agressive of a nickname for a warrior to give his clanmate, let alone his deputy.  After a few moments of quiet and the realization that Laurelblaze was temporarily done, he adjusted his position and adverted his gaze to the surrounding damp and those conversating in it.</span>

Never before head he heard of such disrespectful cats being in the same family before, and he had a subtle feeling that similar traits would be found in the other felines that shared their blood.</span>

Her question stopped him in his tracks. <strong>&quot;Uhm....&quot;</strong> He glanced off to the side, deep in thought. <strong>&quot;Sparrow. I really like sparrow!&quot;</strong> Hares and fish were yet to be tasted, so right now sparrow would be his favourite.

Looking back on those days, part of her wished she’d ended her last conversations with Onionslice on a better note. She didn’t <em>want</em> to lose him as a friend, in fact she fought tooth and nail to try and prevent him as well as Hazelhues from being exiled, but Icestar’s mind had been made up on the matter. Even when they were fighting, she still wanted to consider him as her friend, now she didn’t know what to think. The smart choice for him was to not show his face around this neck of the woods ever again, but if she’d ever encountered him, she might not be so hostile. Still, he might not feel the same, and perhaps it was best they never crossed paths again. For each of their own sakes, the wounds were likely too deep at this point. Too much pain, she didn’t want to add to it. <strong>”Shiversight always had a temper, but I did respect his loyalty to his kin… Even if it trumped his loyalty to the clan.”</strong> in a way, they were opposites in how they regarded the clan in their lives, but they both shared that one trait in protecting their families over all else. <strong>”They’re gone now, no need to go crying over spilled milk anyhow.”</strong> she shrugged her shoulders, deciding to drop the subject for now. She didn’t want to talk about cats behind their backs, she wasn’t going to slander them. The deputy had only shed light on them from her own point of view, describing her own experiences. Still, they did teach her valuable lessons, ones she planned to pass on to anyone who would like to listen. Marigolddust would be that cat today.

She took a deep breath and began to smile a bit, her eyes lightening up once more. Her ears perked back up and she sat up taller now, looking down at the smaller tom as she gave her final piece of advice for now. <strong>”If anyone, and I mean anyone ever tries to insult your honor, or weaponizes their words against you, don’t hold back. Don’t be afraid to give them a piece of your mind. They have no right to do that to you.”</strong> she paused for a moment, and her gaze began to burn with a resolve that’d been forged across the many moons of her life. <strong>”No one should walk all over you, you’re just as important as everyone else around you. From the kits, to the leader herself, you matter just as much as they do. Never forget that, and make sure they understand.”</strong> her voice was steady, firm with the knowledge she was sharing with him. He deserved to know that he also had his part to play in this life. The clan was practically a family, not just a group of cats headed by three or four higher ranks. She wasn’t going to treat them unfairly, and she most certainly was not going to tolerate warriors or anyone else abusing their power over the others by some metric of maturity or seniority. 

<em>Not while I’m deputy.</em>

Her ears flickered, and she now stood up glancing across the clearing. She had yet to check on the others, and the tortoiseshell had faith that the tuxedo tom would be able to take it from here. He could do what he willed with her advice, she wasn’t going to make him accept it. Though she hoped he would take it to heart. <strong>”I gotta go handle a few things, Marigolddust. I hope you pay my words some mind.”</strong>

Truly, she always gushed over her children, even for the simplest of achievements they had made. They were growing up, and she was so proud of them, but also so very afraid of what could happen to them out there. They meant the world to her, but she knew she had to let them go eventually. <strong>”I’m sure he’ll tell you. Voles pretty much run everywhere though.”</strong> they were amongst the most common types of prey that the clan had in it’s diet, along with mice and thrushes. She didn’t need some fancy rabbits or pheasants to keep her fed, she liked the simple stuff. Easy to find, and easy to catch, just the way she liked it. She was never a fussy eater though, she’d take what she could get. Some cats weren’t the same about it though.

She chuckled at her son’s attempts to swipe at her from below, her whiskers twitching from amusement. <strong>”So fierce! I’m sure your enemies will be utterly quivering at the sight of you. Foxpaw, the most terrifying apprentice of ThunderClan! Beware his might! Rumor has it he gets it from his mother!”</strong> she bellowed out a dramatic entrance for him, a toothy grin stretching across her face from ear-to-ear. Even if she didn’t give birth to any of her kits, she still liked to think part of her or Hollyfrost rubbed off on them. Her kits were <em>not</em> weaklings, not to her anyways, they were strong in their own respective ways. Still, she liked to think she was raising titans of warriors. <strong>”I’ll keep it in mind the next time I head out. Sparrows are pretty easy to catch.”</strong>

Marigolddust was listening intently the whole while as Laurelblaze spoke, reluctantly interested in what might have happened in the past with Shiversight and the others.  But, with the conclusion of the topic, his curiosity and wondering over the topic ended just as quickly.  Laurelblaze was right, and Marigolddust didn&#39;t want to seem too dramatic over something that he hadn&#39;t even experienced himself.  Why was he so interested, when this already happened and the family was already gone, likely never to never interact with him at all?  Even so, just as Laurelblaze hoped, Marigolddust did learn a little bit of a lesson by her recounting.  Even the strongest or most bold cats had gained insults at some point, although beyond that point he was still fairly clueless.  Those more confident cats had to stand up for themselves and take the defensive approach, but he wasn&#39;t one of those naturally born leaders.  He had the confidence and strength of the feathers he often collected, and unfortunately was swept away through change just as the plumage did.  Lately things had cooled down a bit, and he could do nothing but hope that it stayed that way.  

            With his gaze meeting the deputy&#39;s once again, he thoughtfully listened to what little she had left to say.  The words were strong, and came through to him just as sternly as they were spoken and intended.  <em>Just as important as everyone else.</em> That sounded like a dream to the young warrior.  It was hard to believe the words, especially when the importance of a leader&#39;s and his own was compared, but he still offered a nod nonetheless.  He wasn&#39;t sure what else to say, and no matyernhow hard he tried he couldn&#39;t come up with anything.  His mind was being as stubborn as it always was, keeping all of the good words just out of his reach when he felt he needed them.</span>

             But, in this case, a nod seemed like it was enough of a response.  It showed that he was acknowledging her words, and there was no doubt that he would ponder them.  Already he was neck-deep in the expansive world trapped inside his skull.  He was only distracted by then for a moment as Laurelblaze said her farewell, or more of see-you-later.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I will.&quot;</em></strong></em> He reasured, although his tone was hushed.  As Laurelblaze left, Marigolddust quietly went back to eating his prey, deeper in his thoughts than he had been before he had spoken with the warrior.

<strong>&quot;There. Bleh.&quot;</strong> The rosetted molly mumbled as she dropped her catch among the fresh-kill pile. Of course, out of all the things she could&#39;ve caught she&#39;d managed to catch a small bird, which wasn&#39;t a particularly pleasing flavor in her opinion. Unfortunately for her, she had to carry the horrid corpse all the way back to camp, and had only just finally disposed of it. She didn&#39;t like birds, whether it be due to taste or otherwise. As her heterochromiatic gaze scanned the camp, she decided it couldn&#39;t hurt to take something for herself. What did she care anyway? She&#39;d done her part, so if anyone else had something to say about it, they would most definitely receive a piece of her mind.
    Selecting a mouse, Mistypaw slinked away from the fresh-kill pile, returning to her more or less secluded spot among the camp - at least, as secluded as one could get within the walls of Thunderclan&#39;s camp. Letting out a sigh, the apprentice toyed with her food with a paw absently, merely letting her gaze roam across the various pelts of her clanmates, a bored look plastered upon her face.

It seemed as though every cat that ThunderClan harbored was retuning to the camp at once as Wrenpaw slipped among a sea of pelts clustered at the camp entrance. The caramel furred apprentice had just returned from the training hollow, and she had brought a very hungry stomach back home with her. She trotted upon ivory and brown paws towards the fresh-kill pile, which was stacked high from the hunting patrols that had also just returned. A pink tongue swiped her lips as she approached and selected her dinner; a plump vole. 

Her amber eyes followed Mistypaw as she sauntered across the clearing, having left the fresh-kill pile only moments before Wrenpaw had arrived. She hadn’t interacted with the other apprentice much, and figured that perhaps now would be a good time. The young she-cat couldn’t deny the anxiety that plunged into her belly as she approached the other apprentice, though a warm smile that etched her lips showed no signs of the nervous feelings. Ever since her interaction with Viperpaw, Wrenpaw had become slightly more apprehensive when it came to speaking to the other apprentices. <strong>”Hey, Miftypaw! Mind if I join you?”</strong> She inquired, her voice muffled around the vole that she carried. <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span></span>

The apprentice had hoped for just a tad bit of peace and quiet, some time alone if you will. Alas, such wouldn&#39;t be happening anytime soon as her gaze locked on an approaching feline. The caramel-furred apprentice by the name of Wrenpaw. She hardly spared the molly more than a moment of a glance, deciding she&#39;d turn away eventually. Unfortunately for her, she continued to come towards her. <em>Stars above...please let her leave me in peace!</em> She let her gaze roam about as if she was busy with something important, but her fellow denmate soon met her. Even worse, she spoke to her. <em>You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.</em>
    <strong>&quot;Oh hello, <em>Wrenpaw.</em>&quot;</strong> She greeted in return, with a hint of reluctance in her voice. Mistypaw wasn&#39;t among the most sociable cats by far, even lesser when it came to friendliness. She&#39;d hope her fellow apprentice was only stopping by for a quick greeting - most had seemed to catch onto her nature and simply leave her be, but apparently, this one hadn&#39;t learned such from those around her. <em>Of course, just my luck.</em> Yes, she minded quite a bit. <strong>&quot;It&#39;s <em>Mistypaw</em> mind you.&quot;</strong> She corrected irritably. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure it wouldn&#39;t matter whether I minded or not. You don&#39;t seem like the type to catch onto such things very quickly, it would obviously be a waste of both our times.&quot;</strong> She replied, pulling her own catch closer toward her, leaving the inquiry more or less hanging within the air.

Wrenpaw’s upturned lips immediately fell as the other apprentice greeted her, saying her name as if it left a horrid taste in her mouth. Panic welled inside of her chest, and for several moments she just stood there, wishing that she had never approached it all. It felt exactly as it had on the evening she approached Viperpaw, ready to kindle a new friendship only to be shot down with fangs that dripped venom and eyes that shot daggers. Every fear that she’d ever had about becoming an apprentice seemed to be coming true. She’d bumped into more nasty apprentices than ones who wanted to be friends, and it made her want to high tail it back to the nursery. She’d spent so long thinking that apprentices built bonds that would last a lifetime, and yet here she was building her pool of enemies while those with the status of friend were a mere puddle. Her jaws opened to release the vole from the clutches of her canines, to assure that she would speak properly from here on out. 

The caramel molly did her best to form the words inside of her mind before she said them, in hopes they could come out clearly and without a stutter that was sure to betray her anxieties. As if those same anxieties weren’t written all over her face for the other apprentice to see. <strong>”Mistypaw, I know, I’m sorry. I should learn to speak without my mouth full,”</strong> she apologized quickly. Perhaps showing submission would lead to some restraint from the other apprentice? Unbeknownst to Wrenpaw, that was highly unlikely and she would one day learn that showing weakness to cats of such nature would only make their tongues that much sharper. <strong>I-it does matter what you mind, really. If you want me to go then I’ll go.”</strong> She added, glancing around the camp in fear that someone else might be observing this pathetic display she was putting on.

<em>Wow, she&#39;s hardly left kithood- if at all.</em> She thought to herself, heterochromatic eyes resting upon the caramel-furred molly. She didn&#39;t need to know what her exact thoughts were, she could tell by her mere body language that this feline hadn&#39;t adjusted to apprenticehood quite yet. Or at all. She seemed hopeful at first, at the prospect of making a new friend. Now, once her words had met her ears, she immediately became docile, perhaps a tad timid even. Such infuriated the rosetted apprentice. Wrenpaw&#39;s will certainly was weak, perhaps she herself, even weaker.
    At her apology, she forced herself not to cringe. Her voice was all but annoying, her cries seeming to drive her mad. Her words seemed to hold a silent plea for acceptance, friendship, a simply shoulder to lean upon. Mistypaw couldn&#39;t provide such - wouldn&#39;t provide such. Disgusting. Who&#39;d ever do such a thing? Only mouse-hearted cats. And she was no weak-willed, mouse-heart. Not by a long shot.
She shuffled a bit away from the apprentice once she&#39;d dropped her vole, wrinkling her nose. <strong>&quot;Perhaps. Or maybe you should just...keep your food in your mouth and not talk.&quot;</strong> She replied, before resting her head upon her paws. It wasn&#39;t long before she commented on her next sentence, claiming she&#39;d be fine to simply leave her be. Of course, she would rather not have to deal with a sorry excuse for an apprentice, but the idea of her running off to cry to a warrior or even worse a high rank, made her think it over for a moment longer.
    <strong>&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t remember saying you had to leave! Haha, you must be mistaken!&quot;</strong> She exclaimed, whiskers quivering. <strong>&quot;If you must- I mean, if you&#39;d like - you can certainly stay, I don&#39;t mind! Just...keep your distance.&quot;</strong> She responded, patting the ground with a paw as invitingly as she could manage.

<em>Ashkit lead Marigolddust to his collection of feathers, before pulling out the dried butterfly, presenting it proudly. He hoped Marigolddust would appreciate this Butterfly as much as he did, as Ashkit had caught it himself.
Ashkit was about to ask if he could ride on Marigolddust’s back, so he could catch more, when he saw a group of apprentices. This excited him, and he ran over to show them his butterfly as well. He tugged the closest to him, which just so happened to be Mistypaw, letting the butterfly fall out his mouth at her paws and gazing sweetly up at them all.</em>

An eyebrow raised upon her features as Mistypaw seemed to have a change of heart, though Wrenpaw did not trust it. If anything, it just confused her. She was uncertain of why the other apprentice would be so disgusted by her presence one moment, and then willing to keep it the next. A sigh escaped her jaws as she stepped a few paces away, sitting down with her prey at her paws. Her hunger seemed to have disappeared altogether, the feeling in her stomach now replaced with feelings of anxiety and something else that she didn’t quite understand. It felt hot, like it was burning her insides. Anger, perhaps? It was a feeling she was unfamiliar with. 


“<strong>Very well,”</strong> she responded. What now? She didn’t know in what other way she could steer this conversation, now that it had so quickly went downhill it seemed as though it would go no other way, despite her effort. Much to her luck, a small kit came bounding up to the pair of apprentices, proudly showcasing a butterfly. Wrenpaw offered the kit a wide and friendly grin, one that she was sure the kit wouldn’t receive from Mistypaw. <strong>”Thats nice,”</strong> she said softly. <strong>”Did you catch that yourself?”</strong> <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span> <span class="mention" title="Navilina#5594">@Navilina</span></span>

She would most certainly be deemed an odd feline no doubt, but after awhile those around her would eventually pick things up. Her nature was a rather twisted one, constantly flipping between pushing others away to pulling them in, before the cycle started over again. She&#39;d toy with their mind, their emotions - everything she could to tear them apart and eventually, they&#39;d avoid her like the plague. And then, her work would be done.
    She absolutely hated being social, but she found this form of launching attack on another the safest route of action. Others would merely use verbal tactics, perhaps the occasional scuffle between them. But Mistypaw had gotten quite well at playing mind games with one another, confusing her opponent and tearing them down from the inside out. Manipulative, indeed.

She hardly paid the other apprentice any attention as she turned to her own meal. A mere word was spared and silence was quick to follow. Perhaps if it lasted long enough, she would decide to leave. Alas, her plans were once again ruined. Perhaps by the worst thing imaginable - a kit. Her odd-colored gaze landed on the small tom, as he made his way over to them. Slowly, she shuffled away from the approaching kit, hoping he&#39;d turn to Wrenpaw. Maybe it&#39;d be a good thing that she stuck around - it would give her time to hightail it ou-
    He&#39;d made it to her and dropped the butterfly in front of her. Her ears lowered slightly, leaning away from the tom. <strong>&quot;Please, I don&#39;t <em>want</em> your butterfly. Though, I&#39;m sure if you take it over to <em>her</em> - she&#39;ll like it, I&#39;m sure.&quot;</strong> She replied with a wave of a dismissive paw.

Following behind Ashkit, Marigolddust wasn&#39;t quite sure where they were headed until the kit suddenly stopped.  He had expected to arrive at a more open area, but instead he found himself at... A feather collection.  Blinking, he smiled.  <em><strong><em>&quot;You collect feather&#39;s, too?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked curiously, crouching and examining the different types of feathers that the kitten had collected.  He himself had the majority of these, although there seemed to be more here than in his nest.  Maybe Ashkit took multiple of one type?  Marigolddust found himself unnecessarily excited as he looked at the feathers, although his attention was driven away from the plumage when he was displayed with a butterfly.  He went quiet at first, not exactly sure how he was supposed to react.  He wasn&#39;t all too fond of insects, and although the butterfly was beautiful, it wasn&#39;t all that fresh.  Fortunately, he could come up with compliments fairly fast.  <em><strong><em>&quot;It&#39;s very pretty!  Did you catch it yourself?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, even though he didn&#39;t have the chance to receive an answer.  

             Marigolddust didn&#39;t expect it as Ashkit ran off with the butterfly, and  out of confusion he paused there for a few seconds.  Did Ashkit want him to follow?  Had he run off because he was tired of being with the warrior?  He would have understood, and wouldn&#39;t have minded, although Ashkit had seemed so thrilled and hopeful before he ran off.  But then again, that could have just been kit energy.  He could have also been expecting Marigolddust to follow to find a new place to play.</span>

             It took him a moment to decide, but eventually he followed where he had seen Ashkit run off to.  If he didn&#39;t want him to come, he could always leave, and he didn&#39;t mind.  After a few seconds, he caught sight of the kit and two apprentices, one of which was his own.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh, um- hi Wrenpaw,&quot;</em></strong></em> he greeted awkwardly, unsure how to approach the other less friendly feline, and suddenly feeling his nerves return.  He glanced towards Fernpaw&#39;s den, debating whether or not he should leave the kit to play with the apprentices.

Ashkit was quite happy that Marigolddust had followed. He greeted the Tom with sparkling eyes, seeing the reluctance in his gaze and turning back, noticing the disdainful apprentice. She seemed quite disgusted with him. This seemed like the perfect time to bring out the “Look.” That’s what his mother called it. It was when he stared with those usually adorable eyes, almost into your soul, with a cold hard look. A look that held sorrow or anger, or simply nothingness. This is what had scared the other kits away from playing with him. And he hadn’t wanted to play anyways. He was just about to give Mistypaw  the look when he heard a new, happy voice, turning to smile at the other Apprentice. When she asked if he had caught the big thing himself he nodded, about to say something else when the mean one spoke. She didn’t want his butterfly? Well, that was just fine. Now Ashkit would make it his goal to force her to praise him for the butterfly. He stared at her, not saying anything, but nudging it towards her, an inch if at all. He slightly tilted his head as if he didn’t understand, flicking an ear innocently. He sat, waiting for her to accept that he wasn’t going to leave until she gave him some sort of an word about his butterfly that he worked so hard to catch. Well. Maybe that was an over statement. The butterfly just so happened to be low to the ground. Pure luck. But still. He deserved the attention and praise. And he would be an apprentice too, soon. She would be forced to answer to him soon. He could already tell they were alike, even if she didn’t know it yet. But they were.
<strong>”I Caught it.”</strong> He stated simply. And then waited.

Mistypaw’s harsh words towards the kit received little surprise from Wrenpaw. Her amber eyes darted down to the vole that lay at her alabaster paws, wishing that she wasn’t stuck in this situation. She could just walk away, she supposed, but what would that say about her? The caramel furred apprentice certainly wasn’t very bold, in fact she was quite the opposite, but she wasn’t a quitter. <strong>”S-surely you can spare some kind words for a kitten?”</strong> Wrenpaw asked tentatively. The mere idea of speaking up for herself or even any other cat made her anxiety spark even more. Her throat felt too tight to speak any further. 

Instead she turned her gaze back to the kitten, and to her mentor who had just approached and greeted her. Her amber eyes were pleading as they met Marigolddust’s, almost hoping he could get her out of this situation she’d gotten herself into. Then again, it was his responsibility. <strong>”H-hi Marigolddust,”</strong> she replied, her voice straining to be cheerful. She once again smiled at little Ashkit. <strong>”I used to hunt bugs when I was a kit too. By the time I was made an apprentice, I’d nearly <em>perfected</em> my hunters crouch.”</strong> She offered some words of encouragement to the kit, shooting a look towards Mistypaw. Wrenpaw could never understand how some cats could be so cruel to all those around them. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span> <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span> <span class="mention" title="Navilina#5594">@Navilina</span></span>

<em>Perfect. Just perrrrrfect.</em>

She&#39;d gotten herself into a dreadful predicament, surely one she could&#39;ve avoided if she&#39;d only left sooner. Perhaps she shouldn&#39;t have worried about whatever had laid in store for her if Wrenpaw had mentioned her attitude toward her. After all, what was some warrior going to do? Scold her? Give her some sort of punishment? Stars, even the high ranks wouldn&#39;t be able to do a thing! They&#39;d simply have to get used to it.
    Her gaze snapped to Wrenpaw at her words, carried on a voice that seemed to waver like a branch with weight that was just a tad too much for it, straining it. Her gaze narrowed, a look of pure, icy daggers. The kit was just as bad, hardly seeming to understand her earlier statement, continuing to push the butterfly toward her. Her frown deepened, but this wasn&#39;t the worst of it. Before long, yet <em>another</em> cat approached the trio, this time a warrior. Wrenpaw&#39;s mentor, if she recalled correctly. The two greeted each other with painfully similar voices, filled with anxiety. Oh how she despised such cats - no wonder the caramel-furred apprentice acted so kit-like! Her mentor was hardly any better, if at all.

Once more, Wrenpaw spoke. This time, it was directed toward the kit, words of encouragement. Seeing the look she cast her way only made the rosetted apprentice more irritable. Everywhere she looked there was someone who made her want to scream, run away and find some <em>actual</em> cats to talk to.
    They were such bad examples toward this kit. Then again, all kits were mere annoyances in her mind. He was still staring at her, refusing to leave. <strong>&quot;So you caught it, good for you.&quot;</strong> She replied with hardly any enthusiasm. <strong>&quot;We&#39;ve seen it now you can go run off to your mother. <em>I</em> for one have better things to do than waste my time with a group of kits and butterflies.&quot;</strong>

Sending a glance around the small group gathered, Marigolddust&#39;s eyes strayed a second more on the most unfamiliar face.  It seemed a hard, cold look was plastered to Mistypaw&#39;s features, making it clear that none of them were very welcome.  Or, perhaps that was just to Ashkit and himself.  It seemed like she and Wrenpaw had been socializing before he and Ashkit interrupted, although he could never be sure.  Tearing his gaze away from Mistypaw, he stood there stiffly, unsure where to go forward with what he had already said.  He felt like a stranger here in this group of younger cats, although he was still a fairly young warrior.  Apprentices had always managed to trigger his anxiety, although that was the case with the majority of cat&#39;s he didn&#39;t know we&#39;ll, which now only seemed to consist of Fernpaw, Laurelblaze, and perhaps Icestar, too.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Maybe I should... leave you guys to your own business-?&quot;</em></strong></em> He began, although as yellows met ambers, Marigolddust felt his throat tighten with apprehensiveness.  Wrenpaw looked just as eager to leave this situation as he did, and Mistypaw didn&#39;t seem any more intent on keeping in the predicament.  Only Ashkit appeared to want to stay here with the others, and he wasn&#39;t scared to show so.  The piercing glare he sent at Mistypaw didn&#39;t seem to break through her hard approach, but even so it managed to unnerve Marigolddust.  Who knew a kit was able enough to have a look like that?  

            The tux flinched slightly at the harsh words that left Mistypaw&#39;s maw, although whether they were meant as such, he wasn&#39;t sure.  &#39;Group of kits&#39; seemed awfully suspicious, and for a moment he thought back to the advice he had been given by Laurelblaze recently.  <em>No, no harsh words- it wasn&#39;t nearly direct enough,</em> he decided, although he knew this could have just been another excuse he made up.</span>

            Angling his eyes onto Ashkit, he had to push himself to ask the question continually entering his thoughts.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Perhaps we should leave her be.  There&#39;s other apprentices,&quot;</em></strong></em> he suggested, his voice soft as he avoided looking over at Mistypaw.  Remembering the glimpse of the conversation he had caught while approaching the apprentices, he came up with something that could help all four of them.  <em><strong><em>&quot;We could show it off to Wrenpaw elsewhere, if she&#39;d be interested?&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, his voice questioning as he sent a quick look at Wrenpaw.  Would this help her at all?  Oh, why was this so unnecessarily stressful?  He only hoped the kitten would accept these suggestions, although it seemed like a 50/50 chance from the determined look he gave Mistypaw.  He should have done better with playing mossball... Maybe then this wouldn&#39;t have happened, even though this was very simply just socializing.

Mistypaws first words didn’t even make Ashkit flinch. He had gotten praise, even if it was reluctant. Her next words, though. <em>Those</em> made him flinch. <em>You can go run off to your Mother.</em> he just blinked, watching her with those empty orbs, before Marigolddust spoke, offering to move elsewhere.
Ashkit nodded at Marigolddust before turning back and shrugging, meowing quite calmly, 
<strong>”My mommas dead.”</strong> It had hurt to accept before, but the concept was simple.
Ashkits mother wasn’t coming back, no matter how much it hurt. But surprisingly he didn’t feel any sense of longing this time. That’s not what his mother would’ve wanted. She would’ve wanted him to move on and be the best warrior he could be, maybe even a leader one day. Who knows?
With this, Ashkit, triumphantly turned on his paws and strutted proud,y towards Marigolddust.

Her ears pricked, not used to the lack of ‘I dos’ that would ring after her question. Icestar watched Acepaw softly, a gentle smile cascading over her maw. Taking in a deep breath, the lynx-pointed leader continued: 

<strong>” Then by the powers of StarClan, I give you your warrior name. Acepaw, from this moment on, you will be known as Acequill. StarClan honours your caring nature and selfless acts, and we welcome you as a full warrior of ThunderClan.”</strong>

Leaning forward, Icestar rested her white muzzle upon the slope of the newly-proclaimed warrior’s forehead. Her feathery tail gave a slight twitch as cheers erupted from the crowd below. Voluminous cries of joys and ‘Acequill’s rang proudly in the clearing. It wouldn’t come to any surprise to Icestar if RiverClan would be able to hear them from the other side of the lake. Amusement seeped into her eyes at the thought whilst withdrawing.

Well, this situation was just just getting better by the second now wasn’t it? She could have handled Mistypaw’s sour attitude on her own, but now there were other cats thrown in the mix which had changed everything entirely. One was a cat she cared for quite a lot, and the other was just an innocent kit who didn’t deserve the wrath of anyone. Wrenpaw could never seem to stand up for herself, but when it came to other cats the action of standing up for them was somehow much easier. Honey colored gaze flicked briefly again to Marigolddust, who seemed to carry just as much anxiety as she did. It made Wrenpaw wonder if even as a warrior, she would be like this. Just a little pawn to be bullied, bossed around, and belittled by those in the clan who thought themselves better than her simply because of their lack of emotions. As if that’s what made a cat strong. 

The young apprentice was on her paws now, and though her nerves wracked her body and her legs didn’t want to support her without shaking, she willed herself not to let that show. <strong>Well, <em>I</em> would much rather be a kit than a bully,”</strong> she responded. She knew the words would have no effect on Mistypaw, but that didn’t matter. They were true, and at least in some small way she had spoken up for herself; something she surely wouldn’t have done had it not been for the presence of Marigolddust and Ashkit. <strong>”Perhaps we should go elsewhere, I’d love to hear all about your butterfly,”</strong> she said, before fixing her gaze on her mentor once more. <strong>”I’d be in much better company with the two of you.”</strong> <span class="mention" title="Navilina#5594">@Navilina</span> <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span> <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

Already the summertime growth of the trees was beginning to shed away in light deluges of yellow blades drifting across the wind. Green-leaf would end in a little over a moon from now, but the signs of its departure always were premature and foreboding. They would be entering the colder seasons soon, and thus their hardships would truly begin. The prey would begin to retreat into their burrows, and the herbs that normally flourished around their territory would go dormant for that time. They needed to stock up as much as they could before then, so they were truly ready for when leaf-bare arrived, the harshest season of all. She’d seen the clan through one tough season, and before that had to pick up the pieces of the end of a particularly disastrous one when she was first appointed deputy of ThunderClan. Still, Laurelblaze was not clairvoyant, even she could not stop the string of fate and where it led to. The deputy had to do all she could to be prepared and to help her clan stay strong. Especially after everything they’d endured.

The large tortoiseshell parted her jaws in an impressive yawn, scratching her chin lazily with one of her forepaws. Twin irises of honey-amber and sea-blue drifted across the camp to inspect the whereabouts of anything amiss, or any one of the felines that made their residency here. Her typical routine, she was practically grounded in it and was particularly stubborn about getting it done. She became rather regimented after her first few moons as deputy, she liked having a routine to follow in the morning. Wake up, roll call, send off patrols, go do some training with her apprentices, do something else. She liked the stability, and she got important tasks done in rapid succession. Laurelblaze always strived to get her work done in a timely manner, so she’d have some free time to herself… However, in her eyes a deputy’s work was never done, and she was often working til the sun practically set and then some. Even taking on sentry duty to ensure the camp wasn’t invaded while they slept. To say she was practically working herself to the bone was an understatement, she was an addict.

Gingerstep sat at the edge of camp, the morning sun warm at her back. The young warrior had found a moss ball left behind from the night before, and had soon found herself pawing at it. Her amber eyes flickered to the deputy across the way, and a devilish smile spread across her small face. She hooked the ball with a claw and, with a swift flick of her wrist, tossed it at the&#160; tortoiseshell.&#160;

&quot;Good morning, Laurelblaze!&quot; She chirped, her fluffy tail flicking.

It had been moons since she had played with a moss ball, and she was sure it had been a similar amount of time, or maybe more, for the deputy. Sometimes it was good to have a little fun, to keep their spirits up. Especially with leaf-bare on its way, it was only a matter of time before morale began to drop throughout Thunderclan.

Well, it seemed someone else had spotted her first and decided to initiate a game with her. The tortoiseshell hadn’t expected to have an invitation to a mossball game in some time, at least not from a kit. Her ears flickered as she hooked the moving clump of moss in her claws gently, just to get a grip on the ball so it wouldn’t roll off somewhere else. <strong>”Hey Gingerstep.”</strong> she returned the greeting with a swish of her bushy tail, before she kicked the ball back towards her clanmate with her large paw. This was a nice way to pass the time, and at the same point she could check up on her clanmate and see how she was faring. It’d been a little while since she last spoke with Gingerstep, she was always interested in seeing how everyone was doing. <strong>”How are you? This season has been busy for us all.”</strong> a basic starter question, but she was mostly concerned about keeping track of the mossball as they were playing their game. She took these games very seriously, she was a champion at mossball.

<strong>”I haven’t played mossball with anyone over six moons in a quite a while. Makes it a bit mire fun knowing I don’t have to worry about going easy.”</strong> she chuckled aloud, her eyes lighting up at the prospect of actually playing this game seriously. She might put on the aura of a stern leader, but even she knew she needed to have fun once in a while to let off some stress.

&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have to worry about going easy. I like a challenge!&quot; The young she grinned as she snagged the moss ball once more, her claws sinking into it&#39;s softness.

For a moment, she had worried what Laurelblaze would think of her. Would she be annoyed? Think she was childish? The insecure thoughts soon melted away when she noticed the look in her deputy&#39;s eyes, the gleam that seemed to be there as they followed the ball. Perhaps she shouldn&#39;t worry so much. Even if others did think those things about her, why should she care? Even if she only made a single cat smile, it would be worth it.&#160;

&#160;&quot;And I&#39;m doing alright,&quot; Gingerstep answered, flicking the ball between her two paws for a moment. Her amber eyes glanced over at the large she-cat before returning to the game once more.

&quot;A little antsy, if I&#39;m being honest,&quot; she admitted, &quot;leaf-bare always makes me nervous.&quot;&#160;

With that, she batted the moss ball towards Laurelblaze once more, her head tilting as she watched intensely.&#160;

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Foxpaw knew no dangers so early in his life. What he once considered his most dangerous threat now sat in front of him praising him for his accomplishments. Nothing sparked fear in his heart. Enemies were unheard of. All he knew in life now was eat, train, and sleep. Threats only crept up on him in his sleep, and even they were no more than nightmares from elders tales. 

For now. He&#39;d get a taste of the real world soon enough. 

Her dramatics only inflated his ego. <strong>&quot;I rule this forest! No warrior is mighty &#39;nough to challenge me!&quot;</strong> Fox strutted forward, chin jutted high in the air. A confidence boost early in his training days would cause no harm. His act didn&#39;t last, before long he was crumbled over in giggles. <strong>&quot;You know&quot;</strong> Breaking out from the laughter, a rather serious tone. <strong>&quot;I thought Icestar wouldn&#39;t make me an apprentice since I only have one ear&quot;</strong> Well, that wasn&#39;t entirely correct. He was deaf in one ear, it still stood on his head. <strong>&quot;But then I thought about Brightheart, and how she still became a warrior. She was brave, wasn&#39;t she?&quot;</strong>

Ah, the pure honesty of young warriors not hiding their emotions from the others. As she grew older, she noticed many warriors as they grew more and more seasoned became more reluctant to share their feelings, bottling them up as a means to save face. They did not want to appear weakened, less capable than they really were. She fell victim to that mentality when she was still relatively young, striving to prove herself. Laurelblaze had equated strength to ability, both physical and emotional. She was always an ambitious cat, striving to be seen as important, a mover, a shaker. Yet she’d made mistakes going down that path, not everything was so clear-cut and black and white, some things were more complicated, some things took time to work out. Roadblocks existed in life, and sometimes they required other solutions than bottling it up and ignoring them, or StarClan forbid, breaking down because of them. She was glad Gingerstep was speaking her mind a bit on this matter, leaf-bare was always a cause of concern and could spiral into outright panic if the clan believed they could not survive the season.

<em>But we will, we always have and nothing will stop me from keeping them safe.</em>

<strong>”Ah, I see.”</strong> she responded to the younger she-cat’s answer with a nod, before kicking at the mossball with just a bit more force than before, kicking up some dust with her swipe. The deputy enjoyed the momentary distraction from work, she too did feel overwhelmed sometimes by the amount of it, yet she tackled it anyways. A deputy could not be lazy, the sanctity of the clan depended on her dedication to them all. She was their second-in-command, just because Icestar helmed the wheel and served as the figurehead of their esteemed clan, that did not give her lee-way to slack off. <strong>”We’ll be prepared, Gingerstep. I check these dens regularly for necessary repairs or maintenance. I’ll also make sure we have enough prey to go around for everyone when the season comes. We’re going to be okay.”</strong> she sounded confident, but she couldn’t make any promises at the moment. Their future was never for certain, she was optimistic, but she also had to be realistic. Still, she wanted to ease the mind of this warrior, so she knew she would be ready to take on the incoming season with a brave face, just like everyone else would be. Building morale was just as important as physically preparing the camp and their prey stores.

Her son’s enthusiasm reminded her of her own when she was his age. Starry eyes and eager to take on the world which was his oyster. It warmed her heart, but at the same time made it ache for him and the rest of his siblings. If she had her way, they would never ever have to deal with the hardships and dangers that came with being a warrior. They would be safe, able to enjoy the happiest moments of life in peace. It was all she wanted for them, a safe place to live their lives without experiencing tragedy or sadness… Yet she knew that utopian dream of a perfect world for her children to grow up in was nothing more than a dream. Imaginary, a fa&#231;ade she used to comfort herself with at night. They had to learn from mistakes, experience the tragedies that life brought with it. To learn the hardest lessons they ever were to learn in exchange for their child-like na&#239;vet&#233; and innocence. 

She hated that idea, and cursed its very existence.

She would revel and cling to this existence while she still could, while they still remained so oblivious and carefree. Laurelblaze desperately wanted them to enjoy every moment of their lives here, and to see Foxpaw now, proud of his accomplishments and seeking to prove to the others that he would be one of the greatest… She wanted to shed tears at this moment. Yet the deputy knew that would spoil this moment, she’d show nothing but support for him forever on out. He looked up to the heroes of their past, and she was glad he was finding inspiration from their tales. <strong>”Yes indeed, she was. She was incredibly loyal to ThunderClan and kind to others, she’s a good warrior to look up to, Foxpaw.”</strong> she purred aloud, she never really had a favorite warrior of legend, but she did enjoy hearing the tales of her clan’s ancient history. These were the cats they descended from, and she couldn’t feel prouder to be a member of their clan.

Gingersteps amber eyes widened as she pounced on the approaching moss ball, her bushy tail fluffing up with excitement. She never thought she could have as much fun with mossball as when she was a kit. And yet here she was playing with the deputy.&#160;
She knew Laurelblaze was right. They had survived through years of leaf-bares over generations, of course they would this time. But she still didn&#39;t like the thought of any of her clanmates going to sleep hungry or cold.&#160;
&quot;Maybe we could start collecting feathers for the nests,&quot; she suggested, &quot;for the queens and elders.&quot;&#160;

She let out a little hum at her own thought. If they started now, they could have the nests plenty warm by the first snowfall. A couple feathers from each of the birds in the fresh-kill pile every day and they&#39;d have everything ready in no time.&#160;

The young warrior swatted at the moss ball once more, sending it skittering over to the deputy&#39;s massive paws. It was nice to talk to her. Even just the few words she had said so far seemed to soothe Gingersteps anxiety.

(Sorry about the late response, I had to work yesterday and then we had a going away party for a friend)

These moments always brought others back down to earth, as sometimes power tended to leave cats marooned in a place where there are not many other cats of their standing in the clan. Kits idolized deputies and warriors, apprentices looked up to them for advice as role models, warriors trusted their judgement and followed their orders. It was nice actually getting to talk to someone outside of her own circle where it did not concern work, she liked getting involved with her clanmates. She wanted to be seen as equal, rather than superior, even if she was to lead them one day. Laurelblaze tried to be fair in her judgement and her treatment of others. She had a particular distaste for cats who abused their power over others… Or at least, abused it in bad ways. There were times where she skirted around the rules a bit just to make things a bit easier for others, or to give some lee way. That or she was just using it to make an excuse for goofing off as “official deputy business”.

Now she swatted back at the mossball with her bushy, striped tail, using it like a bat to knock the ball back to her opponent. <strong>”Perhaps in leaf-fall, when the birds also begin to leave. Feathers are brittle and dry up after a while, any we collect now might no longer be good by the time leaf-bare rolls around. I’ll keep it in mind though, they also make good insulation for the dens.”</strong> she was well-versed in den construction and maintenance from the many times she’d assisted her father who’d helped keep up with repairs to the nursery. He was a resident queen for quite a long time, and he looked after many kits in his life. The den felt emptier without him there… The clan too, since he was no longer amongst the living. She kept up with it in his stead, and she liked to think it was keeping his memory alive, continuing the work he did by keeping that den safe for all the kits and queens to stay in. Especially considering some of her own children lived there. <strong>”Other supplies we can stock up on right now. We can always use more moss and sticks for the dens.”</strong>

The young she snagged the ball with an expert paw, sending it right back to the older warrior with a small smile upon her face.

She considered Laurelblazes words, nodding slightly as she listened. She hadn&#39;t thought about that. If she was being honest, she had no idea that feathers could &#39;go bad.&quot; It made sense, of course, it was still part of an animal. She had just never thought much about it.&#160;

Even though she was a warrior now, Gingerstep knew she still had much to learn from her clanmates. No one was ever done learning. Even the most senior among them didn&#39;t know everything, they could still learn too. Each and every one of them would continue to learn every single day until they took their place among Starclan. Then, perhaps, they would continue to learn amongst their ancestors.&#160;

&quot;We could start drying out the moss now. So it wouldn&#39;t make the dens damp?&quot;&#160;

It seemed Gingerstep had been thinking about the future for quite a bit, considering much of their conversation revolved around preparations they were going to need to make for the upcoming seasons. Laurelblaze was somewhat relieved by that, knowing there were cats concerned and willing to take on the challenges that stood in their clan’s way. If they all worked together, they could easily overcome the obstacles that the world threw at them, that was the whole purpose of the clans anyhow. They worked as one entity to protect and care for one another. A big happy family. 

<strong>”That could work, but sometimes its good to have them not too dry so its easier to use as a binding for branches and brambles. Its more pliable that way.”</strong> they could use a combination of those resources, creating more and more stability in the dens so their clanmates had somewhere safe to sleep. <strong>”So let’s collect moss, and keep some from drying out and the rest dry.”</strong> she nodded, affirming the idea and keeping it safe for later. She then slammed her paws down to catch the mossball under her large white mittens. She then kicked it back towards the other warrior with ease, continuing their game as they spoke. <strong>”You’re thinking about the upcoming seasons a lot, huh? You worried about anything, Gingerstep?”</strong>

The young warrior nodded as she listened to Laurelblazes explanation, snagging the ball when it came her way. She was glad to have a plan, something to work towards, a way that she could help. Not only did she want to prove herself as a new warrior, she needed to help protect her clan in any and every way possible. This would be the first leaf-bare that she wasn&#39;t being taken care of. She would be taking care of others. And she was determined to do the best she could.&#160;

Gingerstep was silent for several moments, pawing at the mossball between her feet. Part of her knew that she was taking too much responsibility on herself. She wasn&#39;t the only warrior, there were dozens of them. They had Icestar and Laurelblaze to lead them and Fernpaw to guide them. But she couldn&#39;t help the fear nagging at her heart. She was terrified of failing her clan. She would never forgive herself if she lost one of her clanmates because she didn&#39;t do enough, or if her best wasn&#39;t good enough.

&quot; I&#39;m worried about the clan,&quot; Gingerstep admitted, &quot;there&#39;s less prey and more sickness in leaf-bare.&quot;

She shook her fluffy head, amber eyes flickering as she batted the mossball back to Laurelblaze.&#160;

&quot;I know the clans have survived leaf-bare every year from the beginning, but I don&#39;t like the thought of any of my clanmates suffering.&quot;

The deputy admired that Gingerstep was showcasing concern over the overall wellbeing of the clan, but if she kept fretting about it, she might sprout wrinkles prematurely. StarClan knows how bad <em>she</em> is when it came to these things, and it was her job to handle the big picture duties and organize the warriors so these disasters <em>didn’t</em> happen. She was a young warrior, and seemed to not understand that these things did happen and it was out of their control. <strong>”Things happen that we cannot predict, Gingerstep. If they do happen, don’t beat yourself up about it. We help the suffering and give them comfort and assist them in whatever way we can. That is what we do as warriors.”</strong> it was truly the best thing they could do in these sorts of situations, and they had each other to rely on in order to support one another. She was glad that Gingerstep was thinking so far ahead, but she also had to learn when to relax and understand they were doing all they could. They were going to be okay, she was sure of it! 

<strong>”Gingerstep, trust me when I say this, we’re weathered much worse than that. The leaf-bare before last we had a massive fire that destroyed much of our territory, and yet we came back, stronger than ever.”</strong> she smiled lightly, catching the mossball under her paws. She did not kick it back just yet, she was making a point and was getting to the main part of it. <strong>”So, we’re stronger than anyone may come to believe. We’ve survived against all odds, and we’ll keep doing so. It’s what we’ve been doing for generations, we know how to do it better than any amateur!”</strong> she chuckled quietly, her heterochromatic gaze glimmering as she confidently spoke about their odds. She was not tempting fate, but she was going to use previous examples of their strength as a clan to help reestablish her point, they were stronger than she believed. They can handle anything! With that being said, she was going to continue their game, knocking the mossball back to her clanmate once she was finished speaking. <strong>”Now try to relax about this whole thing, I’ll make sure everyone’s doing their part so we are prepared!”</strong>

A ghost of a smile graced her delicate features as Laurelblaze spoke. The she-cats entire body seemed to relax a bit at the words,&#160; her eyes brightening ever so slightly. Of course they would make it. They would be fine. They all survived before and they would survive again. And she would do anything she could to help. 

Gingerstep let out a soft hum as she hooked the mossball with a claw. She wasn&#39;t particularly fond of such dim subjects, but knew they were sometimes necessary, especially when they began to gnaw at her. But hearing the deputy&#39;s confidence had soothed her troubled thoughts. She was ready to move on for now, to bring some light into the previously dark conversation.&#160;

&quot;Ya know, I&#39;d like to have a mate and kits one day,&quot; she began, &quot;but all of the Thunderclan toms are so <em>boring</em>.&quot;

The ginger tabby made a show of sighing deeply, shaking her fluffy head in mock disappointment.&#160;

&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll find a nice kittypet to feed me cream and fatten me up.&quot;

Gingerstep let out a snort of laughter at herself, amber eyes glittering. She gave Laurelblaze a grin and batted the ball back to her. Her whiskers twitched with amusement as she waited for the deputys response to her &#39;plan.&#39;

<strong>”Kits are always a handful, don’t jump into having them right away.”</strong> she swished her tail a bit as she glanced over towards the nursery for a moment, a smirk adorning her heavily-scarred features. All of her kits were adopted, considering the fact that her mate was also a she-cat, thus it was not possible for them to have litters of their own. The deputy didn’t mind at all, however, she was perfectly content with taking in kits in need of a family and raising them like she’d nursed them herself. She adored all of her kits, but even the ones she adopted provided their own unique challenges. Parenthood was never easy, but she had experience caring for kits from helping look after her many younger siblings to help her own father out. She loved it though, she got to spend time with her siblings all the time and they provided good practice for when it came to caring for her own children.

<strong>”Well, what happened to that work ethic, Gingerstep? You’re not seriously thinking of ditching the life of a clan cat just to see if some Twoleg is gonna go ahead and feed you dried rabbit pellet-looking things!”</strong> she scoffed at the notion, though she understood it was only a light-hearted joke on the younger warrior’s behalf. Nothing could beat this life, she assumed, Laurelblaze loved her clan and all the rewards that came from the work she did here as their deputy. She never stoped talking about how proud she was of everyone, even when she ran them ragged and put them to work. Laurelblaze couldn’t be more content serving them. She worked harder than ever since she was first promoted to this position, but she loved every second of it. Ambition was always prevalent in her life, she wanted to take flight and lead her clan into a brighter future. She’d learned many hard lessons in her life, and they shaped who she was as their deputy, and she knew it would only continue into the future.

The skies were a nasty shade of dark gray, and the air was heavy with humidity that could only mean one thing— a storm was coming. <em>We’ve been dealing with rain for the past few quarter-moons, its not relenting! At this rate the forest might end up resembling a bog with all the puddles everywhere.</em> the ThunderClan deputy shook her head with a small sigh. Despite the inclement weather on the horizon, she could not put off patrols simply because it was going to rain. If she heard thunder, they could cut it short and retreat to camp where they could take shelter. For now though, the borders needed to be remarked again. Today, she was headed towards the northern border where their lands bordered along unincorporated territories where the rogues and loners dwelled. Even if they weren’t clan cats, they still needed to know that clan territory was not to be encroached upon. She’d bring on a few extra cats because of how long the border stretched.

Clearing her throat, she called for the cats she’d be taking with her into the clearing: <strong>”Jayfang, Willowberry, Marigolddust, and Cloverpaw! Come here, I need you to accompany me on a patrol!”</strong> 

She stood tall and made sure her voice was loud enough to be heard from wherever they might be in camp. This was an important duty of theirs, and they’d need to get it done so it wouldn’t be put off to the last second.

The fluffy she-cat&#39;s ears flicked as she heard her named called. <em>Patrol?</em>  She got up from where she was sitting, trotting to where the deputy was. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m here!&quot;</strong> She mewed, tail flicking back and forth.

Simply pacing around in camp without a clue of what to do, Jayfang was semi-glad to hear that he was wanted on patrol. A remedy for his boredom was an opportunity he wouldn&#39;t miss, but the approaching storm wasn&#39;t something he wanted to get caught in. However, it wasn&#39;t like he could deny a direct request from the deputy. Slightly reluctantly, he marched right up to Laurelblaze. &quot;Hello,&quot; he greeted, dipping his head to the deputy. &quot;Where are we patrolling? And why now, when it&#39;s clearly about to rain?&quot;

The black and white apprentice was peacefully snoozing away from the rest of her clanmates - or at least - she was <em>trying</em> to. It was somewhat complicated to sleep with so many others in camp, watching her and expecting her to be cleaning the elder&#39;s den or some nonsense.

As if on cue, the call of her name rang out across camp and her emerald green eyes flew open. <em>Ugh, as if anyone would actually let me have a nap.</em> Although slightly annoyed, Cloverpaw plastered a grin onto her face and stood up with a bit of an elongated stretch. She meandered her way over to the forming group and let out a big yawn, taking slight notice of Jayfang&#39;s question, gaze pointing towards the sky. <em>Hah, what is he? Afraid of getting wet?</em>

Once her party of apprentices and warriors were gathered together, the tortoiseshell greeted them all with a firm nod of her head. <strong>”Good, we have everyone. We’re headed to the northern border. Let’s stick together and mark as we go. Ready?”</strong> she flashed her patrolling group a wide smile, eager to get out there and get to work. Once this was all done, they’d be free to do whatever they pleased. Plus this was good experience for the younger cats on the patrol for the future, gave them a taste of what the duties for warriors were like. She did not see any reason to continue dawdling by twiddling their thumbs, <em>for lack of a better word</em>, in place. She turned around and begun to lead the patrol out of camp and through the entrance. At once, they were to proceed to the northern border and begin just another routine patrol.

Yet she couldn’t predict what they were going to find on this patrol, just like any patrols beforehand.

The warrior had just finished up his business with a meal when he heard his name called by the familiar voice of Laurelblaze&#39;s.  Looking up, he spent little time pondering what she might need from him.  Instead, he padded up to her and the rest of the cats who had gathered there.  If he couldn&#39;t get the memo from the words that had been called, then he would from the fact that he wasn&#39;t the only one who had been summoned from their activities.  So, they were going on a patrol... The idea of going out of camp with such ominous weather caused anxiety to prickle down his spine, lowering his tail as he couldn&#39;t help but imagine everything that might go wrong.  He didn&#39;t mind getting wet all that much, but the hottest part of the season had passed and the air was beginning to feel more chilly.  Rain could be freezing at this point, and storms had come so repeatedly recently that the whole idea of going out was fairly nerve racking.  

          <em><strong><em>&quot;I... Think I&#39;m ready,&quot;</em></strong></em> he agreed, unable to prevent the moment of hesitation behind his words.  Hopefully they could beat the storm back, even if it was unlikely.  Reluctantly, he followed behind Laurelblaze and the rest out of camp, keeping close to the flanks of the members beside him in hopes of calming some of his anxiety.

Laurelblazes call had caught Tigerpaws tufted attention — Her mother&#39;s familiar voice had the russted and white tabby grow an interest in the patrol meeting. She always preferred to go on patrols her family joined, usually feeling a nervousness prickle at the ending tips of her coat in a patrol flooded with nothing but strangers to the apprentices eye. 

Tigerpaw slipped out of the apprentices den, ears pinned against her head. She glanced over and saw a band of warriors and apprentices surround the tortishell deputy. Hesitating briefly, yet making a quick jump of her pace once the patrol began to turn around for the exit. Silently, Tigerpaw dipped her head to the cats apologetically, before stalking behind her mother&#39;s frame.  <strong>&quot;— hi.&quot;</strong>  The molly flashed her mother a small smile, before glancing back to her paws as the crowd began to move out.</span>

&quot;Oh, Starclan no,&quot; Gingerstep assured, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be ready for kits for a while.&quot;

The ginger tabby shook her head, a small smile upon her soft face. Sure, she would love to have a family one day, but not yet. She had only been a warrior a couple moons!&#160;

&#160;Gingerstep crinkled her nose in disgust at the thought of kittypet food. As if she would ever put that disgusting stuff in her mouth. No thanks. She&#39;d stick to fresh-kill.&#160;

&quot;Fine, I guess I&#39;ll just stick around and become a cranky old elder. I&#39;ll be around to terrorize you through your entire leadership!&quot;&#160;

She let out a snort of laughter, eyes glowing. The young warrior enjoyed talking to Laurelblaze. They could have serious conversations about the future of the clan, or joke around and tease like old friends. It was nice.

The deputy couldn’t help but to continue laughing at the thought of Gingerstep trying to pester her as a wrinkled old elder. <strong>”If you’re gonna be an elder by then, I’d be one foot in the grave at that point!”</strong> her whiskers twitched in amusement, even if the joke was rather grim. It was true though, Gingerstep was well over a few moons younger than she was, but Laurelblaze wasn’t old. Not by a long shot, really. She was still eager to take on her enemies head-first and probably would still be fighting like that when her joints were arthritic and cracking every two seconds like an elder’s. Nothing would stand in her way of a good fight, even if she was old by then she’d still be willing to give a good walloping to anyone who needed it. Laurelblaze had to be the most fearsome fighter alive!

<strong>”Well, guess that’s better than having someone being a total thorn in my side and constantly complaining about every decision I make.”</strong> she shrugged her shoulders, but she still retained her typical, easygoing smile. <strong>”Sometimes it felt like I did something somebody wanted and they were still not happy. That’s deputy work for you, though. Learned the hard way.”</strong> she scrunched up her nose for a moment, before she continued to knock the mossball back to her clanmate’s paws so she could easily intercept it.

&quot;I&#39;ll become the youngest elder in history just to terrorize you,&quot; Gingerstep countered, &quot;and I&#39;ll be plenty of a thorn in your side.&quot;

The young she fluffed up her tabby and white fur, scrunching her face up as best she could. She glared at the deputy through squinted amber eyes and cleared her throat.

&quot;Oh, Laurelblaze!&quot; She exclaimed in her best elder voice, &quot;it&#39;s <em>much</em> too cold in the den for my old bones! I need it warmer! But not too warm, or I&#39;ll be too hot. And get me a nice squirrel! The ones on the fresh-kill pile aren&#39;t fresh enough.&quot;

Gingerstep snagged the mossball from the ground, stifling her laughter as she smoothed down her fur once more. By now, she had completely forgotten the fears that had been plaguing her. She was smiling and laughing and having a good time. She only hoped these good times could last forever. At the deputys last words, she paused though, the smile fading slightly.&#160;

&quot;It&#39;s impossible to make everyone happy,&quot; she sighed, &quot;sometimes I think you just have to do what&#39;s best even if no one likes it.&quot;

The white she-cat stretched her legs and looked towards the entrance of the camp. Most of the warriors today had already gone out for patrols. Wolfshine volunteered so much than others insisted that she should take  a break. However, she couldn’t just sit around and do nothing.

Rain was pelting down on them, slicking their pelts to their frames. No one could get away from the downpour, not even in the deepest parts of the dens, which threatened to be flooded. With the walls of camp eroding and with the recent storms showing no sign of relenting anytime soon, reinforcements were a must. Needlestripe was struggling to tuck a stiff root back into the weaves.

<strong>&quot;Give me a paw with this - it&#39;s being stubborn- rrgh!&quot;</strong> He struggled to keep his hold on the slippery floor at best. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

The she cat turned around and immediately spotted Needlestripe struggling with the root. Guilt washed over her as she realized that she could have been helping him earlier. Sprinting quickly from her cover, she headed to where the Tom was. Rain soaked her fur, and mud splashed around her paws.
<strong>” Of course Needlestripe . Let me help you with that.”</strong>
Raindrops slid over her eyes and dripped  into her jaw and she opened her mouth and took hold of the root’s edge.
<strong>” Ok.. on the counth of three push.”</strong> she said through a mouthful of twigs.

More dead bodies have been found. It was as if they were popping out of nowhere. A grim expression twisted her masked expression as a warrior reported on an additional two. While it wasn’t anyone they knew of, it was bringing down morale. A heavy air had hung around her Clanmates, each report weighing it down more and more. She twitched the tip of her dark tail, ears folding back against her skull.

As she had done with each and every body thus far, Icestar investigated them. She thanked her Clanmate for the information given and began to stalk towards the thorny tunnel of the camp. Perhaps this set will give her insight on how they possibly could have died? The others had given away nothing. It was exactly as Laurelblaze had said. They looked as if they had just fallen asleep. But multiple at a time?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The rain was beating the earth, heavy droplets creating little craters in the mud. Of course it was - the sky had been crying for weeks now. Trees have lost countless leaves and branches to the aching wind. The stream pulsed with water it could barely contain, each bend of the bed causing a white foam to churn from the current crashing. And somehow, a small medicine cat found herself caught in the middle of it.

Fernpaw clenched her teeth, to make sure that the herbs she was charged with gathering were still there. She couldn&#39;t see them through the blinding rain, and the smell of mud and sorrow filled her nose. As she bit into the stems, she could feel them prodding her tongue and a familiar, mellow taste followed. The taste of lavender was something she would never forget; it followed her always (yes, even amidst a raging storm).

Almost as loud as the thunder, a branch began to crackle until it snapped with mighty force. She yelped, jumping backwards as she was reminded of the branch that fell across the thunderpath a dozen moons ago. Hopefully this time, she could save more lives.

But the drooping blooms on her tongue reminded her that she had a much more solemn task ahead of her - preparing those who had passed for burial. More bodies were found on the border, their faces marked with pain. It was her job to clean them up, and hopefully give their clanmates one final moment of peace before they were forced apart for good.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Yes, the weather had been bad. You could hardly tell what time of day it was due to near constant clouds diluting the sun. And still, today was a breaking point for the forest. 

It came without much of a warning. One moment, the creamy tabby was rushing towards the meager shelter that the camp entrance provided. And upon her next breath, mud was dripping off the sides of the camp walls, the water churning up earth as it coursed through the forest, carrying with it debris of a very distraught woodland. What were narrow streams of water off the sloped edges of the quarry quickly had begun to grow into something Riverclan could fish out of. Mud and leaves and branches began to swirl around the stoned walls, creeping across the ground and determined to find ever corner of the camp, as if looking for its weak point.

Such a point is where the medic stood. Frozen in place, Fernpaw&#39;s jaw clenched as her mind raced, trying to think of what to do. Water, there was so much water. It was almost enough to drown out the scent of her fear. Panicking, the sandalwood fay took a step back. And thus, the earth did fall.

Brambles snapped violently and sounds of soft plant matter being ripped apart reminded her of whimpers as the ground beneath the camp entrance began to collapse. Anyone caught in its path was in great danger of getting crushed by falling debris or suffocating within the earth. The earth was falling, just as foretold. It was a <strong>&quot;landslide...&quot;</strong>

The storming weather relentlessly pounded down on her lithe body. The clouds above were as dark as the midnight sky. Thunder clashed overhead, lightning lighting up the entire landscape in brightness. With the sudden torrent of rain, her hunting had been forced to a halt. Clutching the mouse in her jaws, Icestar snaked through the ferns, hoping to reach camp soon where the rest of her Clanmates would be.

She barely made progress when the earth suddenly vibrated. The silvery-white molly’s claws slid back out from their sheaths, gripping the soil as the ground quaked. The branches above her shook and the cries of birds sent a cacophony of other cries rising in the distance. She whipped her head in the direction of the rumbling. <em>The camp!</em> 

Breaking out into a sprint, Icestar made a straight beeline towards her home.</span>

Despite the downpour, the she-cat had been trying to fix dens that were wearing away due to the rain. Her tiredness had made her quite snappy, and she had recently started to feel ill. She prayed to Starclan that the rain would end. <em>Please give us peace</em> she thought to herself.
Before she could even finish her thought, the ground began to shake. Looking up, mud sprayed in her eyes immediately. She doubled back, and was consumed by debris as it swept her towards the edge of the camp. Her head emerged, but she was blinded by the dirt and grime in her eyes.
<strong>” Landslide!”</strong> she screeched as she tried to open her eyes</span>

Darkness. Such had seemed to plague them for quite awhile. The entire forest seemed just as distraught as Thunderclan themselves, the branches of trees swaying to and fro in a sorrowful dance, tears from the clouds above falling down upon them, as the skies weeped due to misery. The sky was dark, seeming to replicate the murky waters that had formed about the territory since the rain had begun. The entire realm seemed to be mourning, a bitter sight indeed.
    Despite dire times, Cardinalspark forced a brave look upon his face. surely, the stars wouldn&#39;t allow this to be their downfall. Perhaps, this would all pass fairly soon...though such seemed to be wishful thinking, a thought spared merely from the mind of a kit. Nonetheless, a familiar face was near and aided the slightest bit of comfort. <strong>&quot;It&#39;s pretty bad.&quot;</strong> He noted, gazing skyward. Tension filled the air, leaving an uncomfortable feeling among the pit of his stomach. <strong>&quot;We&#39;ll probably need to retreat to the dens soon. It&#39;s so wet out here after all and I&#39;m not very fond of it.&quot;</strong> He attempted to joke, before suddenly hearing a rumbling in the distance, the ground beginning to tremble. <strong>&quot;...This really isn&#39;t good.&quot;</strong> He added after a moment eyes widening. And then...he heard the cry. <em>Landslide.</em>

The deputy had been in the camp when all of a sudden the storm had seemingly swooped in, barraging them with a deluge of harsh raindrops and a cacophony of thunder and lightning. She’d been awaiting any of her patrols return to camp, yet today that was not going to happen. The ground beneath her paws began to quake as large boulders and stones caught in a flood of dense, thick mud began to pour down from the sides of the quarry, threatening to bury it’s inhabitants alive. Her eyes widened, and her fur began to bristle as she stared up at the sight. <em>The dens! We need to evacuate!</em> she let out a loud yowl to alert the clan to danger, shaking out her fur as heavy rain practically blinded her in all the chaos. <strong>”Get to safety! Avoid the debris at all cost! Get the kits and queens to somewhere secure!”</strong> she called out to her clanmates, ordering them to protect the members of the clan who would need the most assistance. They needed to take the high ground and avoid getting swept away! <strong>”Go go go!”</strong></span>

The day was dark, gloomy, and wet just like every day prior for what had felt like moons. Of course, the weather had been like this for the better part of a moon. It felt ominous, and scary, which only worsened Wrenpaw’s anxiety. Would this torrential downpour ever cease? It sure didn’t feel like it. Wrenpaw had only been an apprentice for a little over a moon, and she’d enjoyed the first part of her new status until the storms came. The unrelenting weather had really put a damper on the whole thing for her. She couldn’t remember the last time her caramel pelt had been fully dry, and it hung heavily from her exhausted little body. Everything had been more difficult with the rains. Even walking across the camp was a chore, the thick mud making it impossible not to slip and slide around, sucking the cats paws down into its depths. To say hunting had been hard was an understatement, and training had been almost impossible. The entire land was sodden and miserable. 

As if that wasn’t enough, fearful caterwauling soon filled Wrenpaw’s ears, and from her seat next to the edge of the camp she began to see the land giving way to the weight of the water. Muddy rivers cascaded all around her, and panic began to rise in the young she-cats chest. She looked frantically around for her mentor, who could perhaps provide her with some sort of comfort or instruction. Thunder crashed overhead, and a loud wail escaped her jaws much like one that would come from the nursery. How embarrassing. Wrenpaw’s claws sank into the sodden earth to try to regain balance as she scrambled desperately away from the edge of the camp, her eyes wide with fear. She heard Laurelblaze’s instructions, but still had no idea what to do. Get to safety, yes, but where was safe? It seemed as if the entire camp was collapsing in on itself, and she doubted the territory outside of the camp was much more stable.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Water... it surrounded her, threatened to sweep her off her feet and into the hungry maw of the earth. The shrieking of her clanmates was only drowned out by the sound of her own heartbeat. Wild eyes looked at the gushing sea of foliage and swelling soil, desperately trying to figure out where she was, what was going on. Her jaw was clenched so tight that she could feel the lavender snap beneath the pressure. 

But then, she saw a flash of white ahead of her. In the forest, still a little ways from camp. <strong>&quot;Ice..star?&quot;</strong> she squeaked, her voice barely audible to herself. No, <em>no!</em> What was she doing out in weather like this? The last time that happened, she lost a life! Did starclan not grant her sense?

The tan tabby tried to take a step forward, but the land growled in response. It seemed that everything was in place, for her to watch her leader, mentor, whatever she was, die again. But, she couldn&#39;t let that happen. Could she? <strong>&quot;Icestar!&quot;</strong> she tried to call out again, her mewl like a lost kit. And as she did, she tumbled into the earth, brambles and shale making their marks on her pelt and leaving crimson stains. Could she not be heard?</span>

The usual sleek, creamy coat was now currently soaked and sticking to her body as she made her way over to the russet tom, trying to avoid slipping in any mud puddles though by now there was not any point at all with how much the skies continued to rain down on them. It was hard not to wonder when it would all end, or if it would even end at all, but she was not the type to give up hope and continued to pray to StarClan for a time of respite...even a small moment just so they could all get a second to breathe. 

Hearing Cardinalspark&#39;s words, she nodded in response as her body pressed closer to his, trying not to shiver from the cold. <strong>&quot;I could not agree more. I am pretty sure the rain has not only soaked my fur, but my skin as well.&quot;</strong> She commented with a soft laugh, trying to also help lighten the mood as things had seemed very dreary ever since the rain began to pour down on them like this. The trembling in the ground caught her attention, and she looked on in fear at the sight of the landslide heading their way into camp. Her ears pinned back in fright, seeming frozen to the spot as a soft whimper escaped her. <strong>&quot;Cardinalspark.&quot;</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Exploding out of the bushes, Icestar skidded to a halt. She didn’t dare near the edge of the quarry. Rocks continued to crumble, rolling down the steep slope. Mud sloshed everywhere, filling every crack and crevice. <em>Where was everyone?</em> Sea-green optics widened in horror as the worst of thought attacked her mind. Fortunately, the sound of Laurelblaze’s commanding voice eased her. 

She could handle the ones stuck in the inside. Icestar turned back towards the forest. She was going to have to calm the others. 

She pushed back the worries over Bearmask and her kits. The urge to rush back to the landslide and dig through the mud in search of them was unbearable but she forced her muscles to resist. She opened her mouth wide open, taking in the surrounding scents. Surely, not all were caught.

<em>Icestar!</em> The sound of her name sent her head whipping right back to the torn camp. She raced as close to the edge as she could muster, scrambling past churning dirt and scattering pebbles. <strong>” Fernpaw!”</strong> She cried out but she couldn’t see anything. How could she? The medicine cat’s pelt was only a shade lighter than this whole area. Trying to sniff her out when clouds of dust choked her out would be near impossible.</span>

The tuxedo had lost his feather to the strong winds that the storm had brought along with the rain, and although it was just a feather he had found himself going after it.  It was an oriole feather, anyways, and it had served to be a challenge for him to find or get any until now.  From what he had seen, it had been swept up and had landed somewhere on the side of the camp.  Carefully, he leapt onto a steady ledge not far off of the ground.  Once his paws landed, he search for his feather to no avail.  Instead, he felt of soft rumble, one that quickly grew louder.  Rushing water met his ears, and the loud call from Laurelblaze caught his attention.  He suddenly began to panic out of confusion, that was, until he watched the camp wall opposite of him slowely begin to collapse, releasing a wave of mud and debris.  Releasing a gasp, he quickly began to back up, just to feel the stone behind him.  Glancing over, he caught sight of one of the crevices in the stone, that of which had not seemed to be affected... Yet.  Quickly, he leapt onto the other lip and desperately squeeze in.  Just in time, a large splash of muddy ruin collided against the wall.  He held his breath as the cold mud began to rise up his paws, although before it met his upper legs it began to leak out again.  When it was empty enough, he hesitantly peaked his head out to look at those below him.

             It was complete ruin.

             Yowls and screams came out from not far below, mud covered cats panicking as they tried to escape.  Marigold seemed to be one of the lucky ones.  He had been at a high enough elevation as to not get injured.  His fur was just coated in thick mud, a little bit of which had dripped into his eye.  Frantically rubbing at it, he tried to take in everything around him. How could he help? Was the wall <em>he</em> was in going to collapse, too? He found himself rooted to the spot, frozen in fear and panic. (Sorry if I&#39;m interupting something, Soda!)</span>

There was so much going on. The thunder, rain, water and oh the cries of those around him. Chaos surrounded him. The tom turned to Honeydrop who seemed just as terrified as he felt, though his wide gaze pretty much displayed the fear within him. He stood there, paws suddenly seeming too heavy to move, his breath disappearing within an instant. The pelting rain, thunder and wails from his clanmates drowned out his thoughts, his mind seeming to cloud over as fear took over. He couldn&#39;t just stand there though...he couldn&#39;t.
    The voice of Laurelblaze snapped the tom out of his thoughts, causing the russet tom to become more focus. Forcing himself through the fear, his amber gaze falling upon the cream-furred warrior next to him. <strong>&quot;You heard her. We&#39;ve got to move quickly, help anyone that we see. Let&#39;s go!&quot;</strong> He cried, nudging the other warrior before dashing away, though such was a challenge to do so, with the ground shuddering and various debris slowing his pace. <em>Just don&#39;t get caught in it. Don&#39;t.</em> He thought to himself. They had to make it out of here and fast. Time was of the essence.

Reality slowly came back into focus as the words of Cardinalspark broke through the foggy haze of her terrified mind, glancing over at him with chocolate orbs as he nudged her body to get moving. <strong>&quot;Be careful!&quot;</strong> The words finally seemed to be able to escape her mouth as she watched the tom run off to help others, before she started to move, looking around her to help anyone else that she could also. What was going to happen to all of them? Was StarClan trying to send them a message? Did they do something wrong?

Scrambling on her paws as she tried finding purchase, but it was proving to be difficult with the muddy ground that seemed to be making her slip constantly as she hurried forward. Anyone she came across, she would try helping nudge them along, feeling the overwhelming doom descending upon them with each passing second as the landslide only came closer and closer. If only there was a way to pause time? It was a stupid thought but all Honeydrop could think about was how they needed more time, and what time they did have was not going to be enough for them. Were they all going to die?

She couldn’t ignore the mixture of sand, dirt and water surrounding her paws and rising up against her limbs. The flood was only just beginning as more and more earth was collapsing from the walls of the camp, swallowing up the branches and ferns around the dens designed to protect it’s inhabitants. <strong>”Evacuate the dens!”</strong> she cried out yet again, hoping to alert anyone caught inside before it was too late. They could not afford to lose any of their warriors or clanmates, they’d either be crushed to death of suffocate under the mud if they remained here. <strong>”Head to the Highledge! Get to high ground!”</strong> this places was the highest area in camp, even if the rocks leading up to it would be slippery and difficult to climb, they’d be able to avoid most of the destruction. <strong>”Get the youngest and the queens up first. They need help!”</strong> she was trying to keep a level head even with all the chaos happening, her teeth clenched and her stance firm. Suddenly, she saw a large boulder being washed in her path from above, and she dodged the incoming piece of blunt debris into a patch of mud. Her paws sunk in for a moment, causing her to panic a bit as she scrambled to get them unstuck from the wet clay-textured earth. They couldn’t stay here, it was surely going to spell their doom if they had. <strong>”Now! We can’t stay on the ground! Don’t trample anyone! Get the injured now!”</strong></span>

The world was spinning with chaos and destruction, the very earth seeming to fall beneath her. The skies above roared with fury, lightning tearing apart the clouds for a moment and giving that which lurked below a brief moment of light. Heterochromiatic gaze flickered about wildly, a rare hint of uncertainty and perhaps even fear held within them. All that she&#39;d known was being destroyed right before her eyes. And there was not a thing she could do about it.
    Cursing the stars above, the young apprentice forced her way through the waters that had flooded the camp, half-heartedly searching for any souls that might need a paw to aid them in their escape. Her whiskers quivered as the wind whipped about her pelt, the ground trembling quite a bit as the landslide neared the camp. Mistypaw had quite the task with remaining on her paws, avoiding the debris that constantly tried to bring her down, mud clinging to her fur and weighing the rosetted apprentice down. The molly snorted as twigs and leaves began to tangle among her pelt, quickening her pace. Forget the others, they&#39;d get out with time. <em>She</em> just needed to get out of this chaos.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>No, no no no no no. I won&#39;t drown again! be it in earth or water.</em> She was terrified, shaking, bloodied. But she could feel a voice in her ear, or perhaps a tongue on her forehead, telling her it would be alright. Fernpaw didn&#39;t have fear anymore. At least, that&#39;s what she believed. Instead, a boiling rage filled her gut. <em>No, I refuse!</em> She felt angry - angry at the rain, the earth, the forest. She had tried to make it her home, why would it betray her like this? All her fear in this moment spilled over. Curses fell from her lips, damning those she had lost. Damning those who she had pushed away. It was everyone&#39;s fault, that she should find herself staring down the mouth of the land, its fangs of stone and branch bared. Why was she burdened with this, because of some silly dream Beetlestreak had? Why has she never had a say in her own life!

Warm tears rolled down her cheeks. She heard another cry, turning at the sound of her own name, but in her choking anger and returning fear, she wasn&#39;t able to respond. She either had to hope to be found, or get out there herself. She whimpered softly, almost resigning herself to her fate, before a strange color hit her nose. It was yellow, like sunlight. She huffed lightly and watched it flutter below her, and in this moment of strange calm a brilliant idea began to swirl all around her. Maybe, for once, she could have a say..

With notable effort, she clawed up the shallow pit she had fallen in, her pelt truly earth toned now. <em>Where are the rest of those marigolds.</em> Her breath was labored, and she definitely sprained something. Yet still, she was determined to continue, her fear and anger and unresolved grief all coalescing into an eerie calm. <em>Come on, I know the patch is here somewhere!</em> There were bright yellow marigolds, just at the top of the quarry outside of camp. She had tended to them with care, for they were used for many things, from infections to coughs. And now, rewriting fates.</span>

One moment it was like the camp was comfy, cozy - and the scent and sound of rain had always calmed the bi-colored molly when she was younger, like some sort of nature&#39;s lullaby. Now the rain has caused everything to come tumbling down, almost as if the entire world were about to cave in. All that came to Clover&#39;s ears was the sound of dozens of screeching yowls of one word, <em>Landslide!</em>

Here was a secret Cloverpaw had never really shared with anyone, she despised water and she <em>couldn&#39;t</em> swim even if it was for her life. A never before seen expression crossed her face, almost as if she were actually worried for Marbled, for Marigold, and Blazepaw, especially. The cracking of thunder and nearby branches caused fear to pound in the black and white she-cat&#39;s chest. She could hardly <em>hear</em> Laurelblaze&#39;s instructions over the pounding of her own pulse. Water splashed around her paws and she looked around with an almost disgusted look. Gah, she hated clan cats! But they could definitely swim a lot more efficiently than she could.

Her thin pelt dampened and she shivered under the heavy weight of water, wading through the water suddenly with baited breath. But.. what if it got deep? UGH! She wasn&#39;t supposed to feel scared. This was awful! <em>Yep, this is it. I&#39;m gonna die trapped in this god awful camp. This is how I&#39;m gonna go out.</em></span>

Time seemed to stand still and and every noise seemed to fade away to mere whispers and echoes around Wrenpaw. It felt as is everything was moving in slow motion, unfolding before her terror struck amber gaze. And then, in an instant everything was back in real time. The sickening sound of sliding earth, the loud pounding of the rain, the screaming of the wind mixed with the yowls of her clanmates, it all came back to her like a harsh blow to the face. She strained hard to hear Laurelblaze’s next words, whipping around to face the Highledge. High ground, yes, that made sense. The muddy furred molly looked around frantically to see if any cat nearby needed her help, as she wouldn’t dare leave anyone behind. It seemed as though <em>she</em> was the one who was falling behind. The panic had overwhelmed her and held her in place for far too long. A determined look plastered across her face, she began to claw her way towards the Highledge. 

<em>Crack!</em> As loud as the thunder that clapped in the sky the sound of a large tree branch i hinging from a tree cut through the rest of the noise. Wrenpaw looked up just in time to realize that the branch was careening straight towards her. <strong>”Look out!</strong>” She screamed, more to herself than any cat else. Scrambling wildly through the mud she managed to escape the thick of the branch, but the other smaller branches landed upon her and sank into her flesh like claws. She screeched in pain, writhing around  in the mud as she struggled to free herself from the clutches of the tree branch. Finally she freed herself, a new color of scarlet trickling down her muddied and sodden pelt. Wrenpaw didn’t know where she was bleeding from, and at the moment she didn’t care. Squinting to see through the haze of rain she continued her way towards the higher ground with the rest of her clanmates, a limp in her step.</span>

The tom shot the cream-furred molly a grin over his shoulder as he bounded away, though quickly took on a more serious mindset after awhile. His gaze narrowed slightly as he searched about for anyone in need, though at the back of his mind rested the thought of safety. Everything within him screamed at him to get out, to run as fast as he could and not look back. But he could do no such thing. There were lives that could very well be on the line, thus taking every chance he got to run over and help another, or spare an encouraging word to someone nearby.
    But the worse had yet to come. Honeydrop&#39;s words rang in his mind. <em>Be careful.</em> His breath quickened as his heart raced, mud-covered paws beginning to slip upon the uneven ground. And then he heard the crack. The tom gazed wildly about the area, seeing his fellow clanmates fleeing from the area. He proceeded to run, only for a branch to fall upon him, a grunt sounding from the russet warrior. <strong>&quot;Perfect. Just perfect.&quot;</strong> He mumbled to himself, trying to get a hold on the ground below him but to no avail. <em>Come on. This can&#39;t be the end!</em> He couldn&#39;t go out this way, what a horrible thought. But the wet ground made it nearly impossible to get a good grip to force himself upwards. Perhaps...he would go out this way.

The marigold petals were just about within her reach now. She hadn&#39;t prayed to starclan in ages; hopefully they&#39;ll still accept one made in desperation. <em>Please, don&#39;t let me be seen.</em> With a swift bite, she beheaded the golden flowers, their petals all beaten and bruised from the constant rains. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Marigolddust. The clan has gotten too much for my paws, and you know I&#39;ve always been the clumsy sort.&quot;</strong> Smiling softly, she pressed her nose to the center of the flower. <strong>&quot;Please, take care of them for me?&quot;</strong> Her eyes darted across the camp, trying to find her storm grey friend amidst the chaos. <strong>&quot;I love you. I&#39;ll be back when I have healed.&quot;</strong>

She bit at the base of the flower, breaking up the petals from each other. Opening her jaw, they scattered into the gale, the heavy rains forcing them into camp proper. Hopefully the flurry of sweet honey blooms wouldn&#39;t distract everyone from getting to safety. Forcing herself to be content with such a goodbye, she made quick work of the other flowers, careful not to damage the stems or pick to many, but still scattering the drops of sunlight into the clearing so they would be unmistakable. Hopefully that was enough of a message, and hopefully she could deal with whatever her ancestors had to say about impersonating a sign. 

Another crack of thunder stole her moment away from her. Trees were rattled by this torrent, looking as if they were going to uproot. And she wasn&#39;t going to be around to watch it happen. She had to leave, and quickly. Tripping over herself, the former medicine cat scrambled to get away from the quarry&#39;s edge. Perhaps some solitude could be found closer to Skyclan... No no, she had to go to Windclan. Honeysong would surely know what to do. She couldn&#39;t confide in Specklerose like she used to. Not since..

<strong>” Damn it!”</strong> Icestar snarled, pacing the edge. She couldn’t see through the dust. All she could hear were the cries of panic and anguish and Laurelblaze’s commanding tones. <em>What happened to Fernpaw?</em> Was she imagining things when she heard her call out her name? Were all her Clanmates alright? <em>Where was Bearmask and her kits?</em> Her feathery tail lashed sharply in frustration as she helplessly watched.

No one from the forest had arrived yet. She was the only one atop the quarry. Casting quick glances back towards the undergrowth did nothing. Not a familiar face popped out. She didn’t know whether to be grateful that they hadn&#39;t arrived at such a dangerous time or worried about what could have happened to them. The rumbling had been too immense to ignore. Were there other spots that had caved in?</span>

Time appeared to move by so differently. When mere seconds had only passed, it felt like an eternity had taken it&#39;s place. The shouts of her clanmates rang out around her as everyone scrambled to help each other and get to safety, but yet it felt like she did not hear a single one as she only wanted to hear one voice at the moment...her eyes darting around to try and find her tom. Her tom? Was she finally admitting her feelings for him in such a time like this? Hardly now was the moment for it, and she was not going to waste any more time on thinking about it. The only thing that mattered right now was making sure Cardinalspark was okay. 

Honeydrop moved away from the safety of higher ground, desperately searching for the russet male in all of the chaos before her eyes landed on him, trapped underneath a large tree branch. <strong>&quot;Cardinalspark!&quot;</strong> She did her best to rush over to him, partially sliding over most of the way as she tried to keep the worry and fear from showing on her face, but she had never been one to hide her emotions well. <strong>&quot;Are you alright? Oh StarClan, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m going to help you. I&#39;ll get you out of here.&quot;</strong> She had started to mumble in panic, unsure if she was trying to be reassuring to him or for herself as she tried getting a shoulder underneath the branch to help lift up the weight a little. It was in these moments that she wished she was stronger...but she did know one thing...whatever happened, she was not going to leave his side.

Loud sloshing seemed to shout at all being close to or inside the camp, the dirty water below him making its own type of hurricane of what had once been on the enterance&#39;s camp wall.  Fear brimmed his eyes, making his heart feel like it was going to pound through his ribs.  Worries for himself quickly turned of that if the others below.  He was safe, it seemed, at least for now.  Unfortunately, everyone else seemed to be right in danger&#39;s path.  Fernpaw was the first thought that came to his mind, and he desperately searched below him for the ever familiar sandalwood pelt, yet it was nowhere in sight.  Wrenpaw was next, and at first it seemed that she was missing in action as well, although it didn&#39;t take so long for him to spot his apprentice as he heard the loud <em>SNAP</em> of a broken branch.  Eyes following where the limb would go, he finally found Wrenpaw, although not in the situation he wanted to see her in.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Wren-!&quot;</em></strong></em> He began, before being interupted by the lading of the branch.  His whole being froze in that moment, petrified, until he spotted Wrenpaw climbing to safety.  There were so many in danger, so many missing... And no matter how much he cared for them, his cowardly mind held him back, keeping him in safety.  Starclan, what a mouse brained fool he was!  

           His thoughts all came to a pause as bright yellow caught his eye.  Focusing hard on it, he tried to figure out what it was from so far away.  It took a moment, but another one came, and soon another.  More and more marigold petals drifted down to the chaos below.  He felt his heart sink ad he figured out what exactly was raining down on the destroyed camp.</span>

          Why was it that a bright sight such as this disappointed him?  Why was he feeling so... Morbid?  Was it because it could have been the petals to flowers Fernpaw could have had moments ago, and this was a sign of her demise?  But it seemed too... <em>Intentional</em>.  Perhaps it was a sign from Starclan, although what it meant, he wasn&#39;t sure.  Nor did he feel excited to learn.  He searched the remaining ground above for any signs of the cat responsible, but he saw nothing.  Only the snowy form of Icestar in the distance, and she was too still to o have been doing this.  Where was his Fernpaw?  Why were there marigold petals? A petal landed at his paws, and for some reason the bright, cheerful color only made him feel saddened pain.</span>

His breathing became heavy as he continued to try and wriggle out from under the branch, though if he moved wrong, he&#39;d get even more tangled up in it. He could already feel the sharp ends cutting into him, entangling themselves among his russet pelt. <em>Come on, Cardinalspark. You cannot go out like this.</em> Forcing his claws into the ground, he attempted to wriggle out from under it instead of forcing it off of him, but alas such a task wasn&#39;t an easy one. But he couldn&#39;t give up. He couldn&#39;t...
    And then, a familiar voice reached him. The russet&#39;s head rose and his gaze met Honeydrop&#39;s. His tail shifted a bit, a feeling that was a mix between hope and fear rising within him. He was glad that the molly had found him, forcing the branch up a bit to aid him. Though he knew that time was short and he wasn&#39;t sure if they&#39;d make it out in time. <em>This is all my fault. You should&#39;ve ran, stupid!</em>
    <strong>&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you Honeydrop, but you should get going! I don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll be able to free myself, much less if we&#39;ll have enough time to get out if I do get out!&quot;</strong> He replied, slowly pulling himself forward, pieces of bark snagging at his pelt. <strong>&quot;You&#39;ve...you&#39;ve got to go! Don&#39;t worry about me, I just want <em>you</em> safe with the others!&quot;</strong> He added after a moment, feeling a pang at his own words. But he wouldn&#39;t risk her safety for his own. Nonetheless, he slowly worked his way from under the branch to his best ability though the thought of getting swept away at any moment never left him.

Hearing him speak at least gave her the comfort he was still conscious and moving, though the words that left him pierced her heart and soul, shaking her head in response as the tears she fought so hard to hold back slowly came falling down her cheeks. <strong>&quot;I am not leaving you, Cardinalspark. I don&#39;t care what happens...I am going to stay with you, no matter what.&quot;</strong> She made the promise, whether he liked it or not, and she was determined to stick by it. Of course, she was utterly terrified, and full of fear as the chances of them dying grew higher, but she could not imagine ever forgiving herself if she left him now. They either both got out, or she would die trying to help him. 

Honeydrop tried even harder to lift the branch up more, wincing a little as she felt a few areas on her back getting scratched though none of it was that bad. <strong>&quot;Come on, Cardinalspark...you&#39;re almost there. Just a little bit further.&quot;</strong> She was trying her best to sound encouraging without acting like they were going to die if he did not end up getting out from underneath the branch soon, but her firm stance was starting to falter as the mud was making it difficult to hold steady for a long amount of time. <em>Please StarClan. Just a little longer.</em>

The clan was working together it seemed to help the weak and the injured get to safety amidst all the wreckage. They were all working as one even in the face of a tragedy, where many might succumb to fear and panic and be swept away. Not everyone was safe, she knew that, but it was still comforting to know they were all looking out for one another. <strong>”Work together! Don’t leave anyone behind! We can do this ThunderClan!”</strong> she was encouraging them, trying to appeal to their loyalty and sense of altruism towards one another. They’d increase their chances of survival if they helped one another, and they were doing it. <strong>”We’re gonna be okay! Everything is going to be okay!”</strong> 

She could never make promises of safety or survival, but if they did, she swore they were going to recover from this and move on, just as they always had in the past. Laurelblaze had an incredible amount of faith in her clan.

The deputy had been pulling herself out of the rising muck by clawing her way up the slope that led up to the Highledge, mud caked on her fur and twigs and other junk clinging to her frame. She could feel that her limbs were tired, bruised from debris that knocked into her, but she was otherwise uninjured. <em>Thank StarClan…</em> even if it was a bad time to be thanking their warrior ancestors, she was glad to still be alive. As she began to do the exhausted climb up towards the leader’s den, to safety, she noticed a curious sight. Bright yellow petals were flowing into camp from the medicine cat den, swirling around in the torrent of mud and earth below. <em>What? What was that?</em> her gaze narrowed, and she shook her head as she began to climb higher and higher, away from danger. <strong>”Follow me everyone! Get to the Highledge!</strong></span>

<span class="mention" title="Bronzewing#9200">@Bronzewing</span> 

Sparrowfeather stormed into the camp, restless and upset. How dare Sandstride forget? She didn&#39;t even get to carry the squirrel she caught because the rest of the patrol had felt they needed to hold more than necessary. But whatever-. She can move past this. She lifted her head to try and spot Pinefoot out of the crowd. Painfully aware that Sandstide must have just been catching up now.  

She was moving towards the warriors den. She was going to just make a new nest and hope Pinefoot was in there- but it had started to storm- rain pouring from above and into the clearing but something was up- the water seemed to leak bits of dirt and mud- a big mud glop fell next to Sparrowfeathers paw....grasses and roots were uprooting themselves- bending towards and down to the clearing like they were slowly bowing to the cats. The rain picked up, the wind started to roar in Sparrowfeathers ears- leaves fell into the many puddles forming flying past Sparrowfeather like a flurry of wasps. Sparrowfeather gasped as she finally realized what was going on- she had never seen it happen, but she had heard of landslides happening moons ago... She was startled and panic striken- she had only just begun to move her paws- picking them up slowly- she couldn&#39;t look away from the walls...she was afraid if she did, something would happen she couldn&#39;t see- she heard this horrible <strong>CRACK</strong> and a tree hurtled into the camp. Sparrowfeather was dimly aware of cats yowling in fear around her. She finally came to her senses and scrambled to the side- the mud making every step she took agonizing slow as she tried to balance. This all happened in seconds but it felt like minutes...hours... 

She had barely cleared the large oak. It had slammed in between the camp walls- ...but Sparrowfeather wasn&#39;t in the clear. Large rocks fell in to her side and smacked her down. She couldn&#39;t breath- she tried to run but more were falling around her.</span>

It felt as if she was stuck in a nightmare. Forced to be a bystander, she watched in utter helplessness as her Clanmates scrambled up the Highledge, led by Laurelblaze. Devastation ravaged her expression as she checked off each of the cats. So much more missing…

Her pacing ceased, pausing by what used to be the winding trail that led up to the stone hollow. Now it was blocked by the landslide, preventing her from racing down to help her Clanmates. She was <em>safe</em> while they suffered. 

Gritting her teeth, Icestar remained rooted to the spot. Pelt drenched in rain water and clinging to her lean-muscled form. <em>What can I do?</em> Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Marigolddust from where she had heard Fernpaw’s initial cry of her name.  <em>Could I even reach him?</em> If she didn’t try, she would never know. Desperation seized her splintered heart as the silvery-white molly searched for solid purchase in the sifting ground. 

<strong>” Marigolddust!”</strong> She cried out.

As the environment began to rumble, Gullykit&#39;s heart had alrrady started to race. The tense atmosphere. Crashes, crackles, yowls of fear drowning out the ones that were trying to help. He knew it all too well. The flashes of fear in his mother&#39;s eyes and her chokes and gurgles as the overflow of water constricted her throat and lungs. Gullykit and his grandmother had really tried to help, but this just hadn&#39;t been enough. And as the rushes of fear ebbed into his veins, it almost tuned out the cries of his grandmother.

Loose earth, rock, and shredded plants blocked Gullykit&#39;s road to his grandma. &quot;Grammy!&quot; he shrieked, trying to call to her over the immense sounds of panic attacking his ears and sending a high pitched whine into his ears. <em>No, no no no no no!</em> he thought in panic. He didn&#39;t care what his grandmother thought of him - she was the only family he had left and he would not lose her!

Scrabbling desperately through the loose earth, the small tabby tom thrashed through the mud and branches, adrenaline blocking out the pain from the scrapes and scratches and splinters daggering, slicing, and scraping his legs. Before long, he felt the mud rising, and soon his legs were fastened to the ground by the mud as it edged closer to every nook and cranny of ThunderClan&#39;s camp.

<em>NO, NO, NO NO NO</em>
<em>NO!</em>
<em><strong>NO!</strong></em>

All that raced through Gullykit&#39;s mind was just that as the earth surrounded his vision, blacking out his thoughts, filling his nose and throat.

<em>This can&#39;t be happening...</em>

The rain pelted down upon the two felines, thunder roaring overhead. The russet warrior could feel his strength slowly leaving him, exhaustion coming into play. Honeydrop had refused to leave his side and while such was comforting it was also terrfying. <em>If she dies...it&#39;ll be your fault.</em> A quiet voice said to him. He would put himself before her. But he could only do it if he managed to get out. He had to try. He had to.
    With a heavy breath, he gave a slight nod at the cream-furred warrior&#39;s words, dragging himself onward. He grimaced, a hiss escaping from him as the branch cut into his back, but such couldn&#39;t stop his progression forward. He might bear some scars at the end of this...but he&#39;d be alive. Hopefully.
    At last, with one last heave the tom was free. He gasped as he did so, rising upon shaky legs. <strong>&quot;Stars, you&#39;re stronger than I thought. Next time, we should do this the other way around though.&quot;</strong> He said to her, a brief smile appearing on his face. <strong>&quot;Though seriously...thank you. Let&#39;s hope my little stumble won&#39;t be the end of us.&quot;</strong> He added after a moment, urging her onward and toward the higher ground where the rest of their clanmates were gathering. He momentarily noticed the sight of yellow petals flowing about the camp, but there was no time to question the oddity. Turning back, the tom bounded onward, keeping Honeydrop within his sight.

The young tom had been in the apprentice’s den when the landslide had initially struck, and he was awoken when water and mud began to fill the den. He’d nearly gotten stranded inside before he managed to claw his way out, panting and gasping for air as he struggled to get into the flooding camp. The apprentice stared up at the camp walls, seeing his mother on the outside. He wanted to cry for help, but he was exhausted and out of breath, all he could make out amongst the loud cries of his clanmates and raining debris was the cries of their deputy to get to safety on the Highledge. His gaze traveled towards other members of the clan, until it settled on the familiar caramel pelage of Wrenpaw, as well as the sight of blood staining her pelt. <strong>”Wrenpaw!”</strong> he cried out to his friend, before he realized she was climbing out of the way of danger, but she was clearly injured. He could feel stinging on his sides, he’d gotten cut by debris in his way as he clawed out of the apprentice’s den, nearly suffocated by the earth. 

<strong>”I’ll help you! Keep going!”</strong> he called back to his friend, stumbling over rocks and debris in his path as he followed after her via the path she was taking, his fur stained with mud and blood from his own injuries. He needed to get to safety, he was worried about his family and his friends, but the only way he could help them was if he stayed alive!

A few more moments, and Honeydrop was sure her strength would have given out, but luckily that did not happen and Cardinalspark was now free. She silently thanked StarClan for the extra bit of strength as she moved away from the branch, letting it drop back down to the ground as she quickly moved forward to  nuzzle the tom, though she did not dwell on it since they did not exactly have time to rejoice in the moment of small victory. 

<strong>&quot;Let&#39;s hope there is not a next time.&quot;</strong> She responded, gazing at him with a faint smile before hearing his words. <strong>&quot;None of it is your fault.&quot;</strong> She pointed out softly, before starting forward as he nudged her along, knowing they needed to hurry up before they could get swept under the oncoming landslide. A small yelp escaped her as she slipped, falling to the ground, before scrambling to try and get back up again to keep moving on. Every second counted and none could be wasted. She just hoped they would have enough time to get to high ground...she had to believe they would make it. StarClan wouldn&#39;t have given her the strength to help Cardinalspark, just for them to die...right?

Yet another interuption snatched his attention, bringing it to another familiar voice, this time belonging to the fem he had spotted not long before.  Ears perked and eyes wide, Marigolddust tried to concentrate on what was happening.  Was he going to get off of this small ledge?  But he was safe here so far, and the idea of trying to move feared his heart with fear.  The last thing he needed was to take a wrong step and slip down into the wreckage below, especially when it was still active.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I-Icestar?&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, his voice weak yet his tone strong enough for her to hear over the sound of wet ground against wet ground.  

              A question was continually ringing in his head, echoing so loudly that it got rid of all other thought.  So, what was he to say other than what was filling his brain to the brim?  <em><strong><em>&quot;What should I d-do?  How&#39;d this happen?&quot;</em></strong></em> He stammered, unused to much of any natural disasters.  This was new to him, and he couldn&#39;t help but wonder how this could have happened to them.  They had such strong walls, always keeping them safe from outside dangers... But, for once, their walls had betrayed them, bring death and blood onto their ranks.  He doubted he&#39;d ever be able to trust them again, even if they did survive and fix all of this.

Sandstride followed after with the rest of the patrol, stretching out her paws, still thinking nothing of the Sparrowfeather incident and instead chatting to many of the other nearby cats. Somehow she got into the camp before the new warrior did, moving fast to deposit the prey she had caught before looking at it happily....and what was that noise? 

Mud. All over the place, falling from  the sky, creating puddles on the soft ground, a mess all over the place... Puddles, mud, a disaster, grasses and leaves moving all over the place like a river of land... Sandstride was always good at running in emergencies. It would take her a while to calm down and come back for other cats, instead running in a flurry of paws as far as she could go... the yowling of cats and breaking of ground taking out any other noises in the world. A crack broke the silence and she heard a tree flatten the ground behind her, but she was already too far off, making her way out of there, running as fast as she could... everything felt fast, as if the world was on double speed. Her paws, as fast as a leopard, striking at the ground in speeds unheard of until she was out of the camp, sliding on the wet ground as she moved, seeing other fellow Clanmates running beside her.... 

It took her a while to realize that other cats were calling out for their friends and families. Sandstride didn&#39;t have any real family to call for, but her mind went back to some of her friends- Pinefoot and Sparrowfeather, and some of the cats on the patrol- and this is when she started to hesitate. Was she going to go back there, find the injured cats that she had thoughtlessly left behind?

Yes. It was the ThunderClan thing to do.</span>

The sound of her name, though cut off from the cracking sound of the branch that had fallen, allowed her to pinpoint her mentor at last. She breathed a sigh of relief knowing that he was okay, and out of harms way for the most part. She didn’t know what she would do if anything had happened to Marigolddust. Again, her own name rang in her ears, though this time it came from another direction and another voice entirely. She spotted her friend, covered in mud, blood and debris just like she was. So much anxiety and fear was lifted away from her shoulders at the sight of her friend.   Though she would have felt better if he was already safe on the Highledge, she was grateful that she didn’t have to struggle alone anymore. <strong>”Coyotepaw! Are you okay?”</strong> She asked, her features brimming with worry. He looked relatively okay, aside from the blood on his fur that was just visible through the thickness of the mud that clung to him. She supposed he didn’t look too much worse off than she did. 

She nodded at his next words, turning her attention back towards the outcrop that they were heading for. <strong>”Thanks,”</strong> she breathed, panting much more heavily now. Together, they scrambled up the path that led to the Highledge where much of the clan was already gathered. Every now and again she would lose her footing and stumble into Coyotepaw, and she would mutter out and apology. <strong>”Sorry, I hurt my leg when that branch fell,”</strong> she panted. Her hind paw stepped on a loose rock which was barely held in place by the unstable ground, and sent it tumbling back down the hill. Her hind leg was pulled out from under her and she fell flat into her stomach, her chin thrusting into the mucky ground. <strong>”Yuck!”</strong> She spat. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

Most of the cats had found help and were able to get themselves out. Wolfshine’s eyes were still bothering her as she trotted up to the highledge. The camp was in ruins, desecrated beyond repair. She sighed and stumbled to where the clan was gathering. Through hazy eyes she searched for any dead, her clanmates that may have succumbed to the landslide.
Queens and kits were reunited, nuzzling each other as they embraced. Apprentices and warriors grouped together. Wolfshine realized for the first time how alone she was. She looked at her belly in sadness. If only she could have kits too, if only she had a mate and a family here. She wasn’t getting any younger.
No matter. No matter now. The clan was most important. It always had been.
She stared painfully at the worried mothers.

It was quite a good question to ask. <em>How</em> exactly could a structure that was supposed to protect them collapse in on itself? <strong>” Stay where you are!”</strong> Icestar commanded. The ledge he had found looked solid enough compared to the unpredictable ground around. <strong>” I’ll come to you!”</strong> The silvery-white molly was careful to alternate between sheathing and unsheathing her claws as she slid down slowly, grabbing at any momentary purchase. All it took was one wrong step and she could wrench a claw right out from her paw. <em>Almost there!</em> She was only a few fox-lengths away...

Unfortunately, luck wasn’t on her side today. The earth moved again and she was skidding down the slope quicker. The pebbles skittered underneath her. 

She heard the rock shifting before she saw it rolling forward. <strong>” Marigolddust!”</strong> Icestar shrieked out a warning. Instinct seized control of her movements. Her masked face darkened with determination, sea-green optics blazing in its strength.  ThunderClan’s leader then darted forward, shoving the young warrior from his safe spot. 

Standing atop the ledge, Icestar looked at the boulder with widened eyes, backing up to the outermost edge of the ledge but there was no escaping it. In one desperate attempt, the silvery-white molly whirled around and leapt right off. Thick mud sloshed around her dark limbs. Icestar half-slid, half-sprinted down but it was still too steep. Half-way down and her paws caught on a rogue tree branch. A sickening crack and her body tumbled to the ground. She pulled at her stuck paw but only pain shot up into her heart. She caught Marigolddust’s eyes one last time, fear and panic lingering in the depths of her gaze, before the rock reached her. Then it was over.</span>

<strong>”It’s fine, Wrenpaw. You’re talking to someone who nearly got buried alive back in the apprentice’s den, kind of ironic, really.”</strong> he shook his head in disbelief as he worked with his friend to climb the slope, only to stumble slightly when she slipped onto her stomach, her hind-leg caught under mud. <strong>”Wrenpaw!”</strong> he gasped lightly, before he regained his footing and grabbed her scruff, tugging on her to try and pull her out of the mud in order to keep going. <strong>”I got you! If we work together we can get to the Highledge.”</strong> he wasn’t going to let go and let his friend potentially die when he had the chance to do something. They were going to get out of this and live to tell the tale. This was not the end!

He could feel the mud tugging his friend down, trying to suck her under as it only flooded more and more. He pulled harder, trying to lift her out of the earth without trying to injure her leg. <strong>”I’m not leaving you here! We’re in this together!”</strong> he was incredibly loyal to those he considered a friend or family, and he liked to count Wrenpaw among the cats he was closest to. He didn’t want to leave her behind, it was wrong and he would gladly try his hardest if it meant she would survive.

Then, he heard a cry coming from his mother for another cat, then her tumbling to the ground and being sealed away by a stray boulder. His eyes widened as he let out a loud, strained cry, horror filling his features. <strong>”Mother!”</strong>

Sparrowfeather could only watch- pinned under the large rock, bits of mud and dirt rained on her body and face- She yowled and kicked out- she didn&#39;t have family in Thunderclan, even though she was born here...she just hoped a clanmate would help...but maybe this was it....She kicked out and screamed as dirt fell on her head- her eyes watered and mud caked her pelt and everywhere she could think of. Earth was still falling on her- covering her view to the point it was so heavy she couldn&#39;t lift her head up anymore- she sagged under the weight- her mind moving quicker than a rabbit- she didn&#39;t know what to do- the dirt was already starting to cover her nose...breathing was getting harder. Almost impossible. She couldn&#39;t move...she felt panic light up ever fiber in her. She thrashed out- calling for anyone- did Sandstride get out? Did Pinefoot? She needed to know but she couldn&#39;t move....

Dirt was completely over her. Her paw was able to make a small hole. But her air was just about at zero. She could smell the richness of the earth in her lungs. It pressed against her eyes....the pain in her side from the rock wasn&#39;t even so bad anymore. She didn&#39;t know how this could all happen...but she was so tired...it was so easy to just give up now...the yowling was silent. She gave a feeble meow before going quiet.</span>

Pain. That was all the young warrior felt. Her lower half was completely numb, and everything was spinning around her. Yet, in her mind, it was worth it now that the clanmate she freed from the landslide was safe.

<strong>&quot;Someone help - p-please..&quot;</strong> She meowed weakly, before succumbing to the dizziness.

The she-cat watched in horror as her  leader was overcome by the boulder. 
<strong>”No!”</strong> the she cat screeched. It was all too much. Too much suffering and pain was happening around her. Wolfshine couldn’t move. She couldn’t speak. Everything was slowing down before her. She as powerless for once in her life. The clan was falling without her. She could only stand and watch as everything around her was destroyed</span>

If she hadn&#39;t moved her clanmate away from the boulder, they would&#39;ve been crushed instead. Irispetal knew what she was signing up for by becoming a warrior, and if this was how she was going to go, at least she had done <em>something</em>.

Overcome by darkness, she falls unconscious.

Through her despair, she spotted Irispetal falling unconscious. She sprinted over and hovered over the she-cat. 
<strong>” Are you ok? Are you awake? Please say something”</strong>
Wolfshine realized that there may be no response. She frantically looked for anyone around to help her.

<strong>”Well, I’m glad you didn’t,”</strong> she replied, grunting with the effort of pulling the weight of her own body. Exhaustion was making her limbs tremble and quake, as unsteady as the very earth they walked upon. A dark thought entered her mind about what it would have been like if Coyotepaw really had gotten buried alive in the apprentices den. He was her closest friend in the clan, and it was hard to think about going through apprenticeship without him. She shook her head to rid herself of the thoughts, blinking gratefully at the tom as he helped her regain her footing. Wrenpaw was known for being a clumsy cat, but it was even worse now with how slick and wet the ground was, and how utterly exhausted she felt. Her features twisted and scrunched with the effort, but soon she was scrambling back up the slope determinedly again. 

<strong>”We can do it, we’re almost there!”</strong> Wrenpaw said, responding to his encouragement with some encouragement of her own. She wanted to be able to help him just as much as he was helping her. They were getting closer, and as each moment passed it seemed more and more within reach. She nudged Coyotepaw with her nose, beginning to quicken her pace. <strong>”Come on, we’re so close,”</strong> she panted, still remaining close to his side. There was no way she was going to reach the top before him. They were going to do this together. 

Her heart plummeted into her stomach as she heard the yowl of their leader, and she followed Coyotepaw’s gaze to where Icestar was. She winced as he cried out for his mother, who had disappeared beneath a large rock. <em>Oh no. No, no, no,</em> she thought, dark brown ears pinning flat to her skull. She laid her tail across her friends shoulders, bowing her head for a few moments. She couldn’t imagine the kind of pain that he was</span>

The tom was exhausted beyond belief, his gaze beginning to fade just a tad. They&#39;d come so far, yet they were nowhere near being close to things being over. All about him cats were experiencing some sort of chaotic event within that which was already happening. All the noise, wind, rain and emotions...he&#39;d merely wish to curl up into a ball and cease from existence for the time being. There was just <em>so much</em> and more and more continued to happen. He could hardly take it.
    For once, the tom&#39;s usual playful nature faded entirely, even Honeydrop&#39;s words did little to soothe his worries. He might&#39;ve not caused everything, but their lives could very well be on the line...well, more than they already were. But there seem to be just the slightest bit of hope nearby. The ledge.
    <strong>&quot;We&#39;re nearly there.&quot;</strong> He noted after a moment, eyes poised upon where many others gathered. But alas, that hope would banish within an instant, as he watched in horror as their leader fell, a boulder falling upon her. He nearly fell upon the ground in despair, dread resting upon his face. Was she...dead? <strong>&quot;No...No!&quot;</strong> He hated this. He hated it all so much, and yet it seemed as if the destruction would never end. <strong>&quot;Let&#39;s hurry...we have to get to safety...&quot;</strong> He managed to say to the warrior beside him. Though his mind was screaming. <em>Why Starclan...why?</em>

<em>I swear when this is over...</em> Cloverpaw obviously wasn&#39;t very happy to be getting wet, and truthfully to her not much could get worse. Unfortunately she couldn&#39;t blame this on anyone.. could she? It wasn&#39;t like it was the clan cats&#39; fault that she was in this mess.. it was the stupid weather. Her family would be safe, and it wasn&#39;t like she could care anyway. Her mother hadn&#39;t been there for her, Grouse hadn&#39;t been there, and now <em>Rooksnap</em> wasn&#39;t here. Why should she care to ask for help anyways? She didn&#39;t need it. 

A soft gasp passed her lips as she felt the heavy weight of an object suddenly land on her paw. When the ground had gave way, there had been a rock that had broke lose from the ground.. and she had blocked it&#39;s path. Her paw was caught! <em>WHY is this happening to me?</em> She snorted. Yet as stubborn as Cloverpaw was, she didn&#39;t dare call for help. <em>That</em> would show weakness.. something she wasn&#39;t. She wasn&#39;t stupid, though. She knew she was in danger.. but she was.. almost. there. 

Pulling with all her might, the scrawny she-cat bit into the inside of her lip and pulled with all her might to release her paw from the boulder&#39;s grasp. &quot;<strong>Ugh!</strong>&quot; Her paw sliced against the sharp edge of the rock, but with a wince and a soft but painful intake of air, it was free. <em>Ow...</em> She thought to herself but pushed further up the hill, totally choosing to ignore her gimpy walk and the blood stain that tainted her the white parts of her pelt. <em>See? Who needs help?</em> But as Cloverpaw made her way up, she hadn&#39;t realized just how dizzy causing herself so much pain had made her.... And nausea followed soon after.</span>

The femme was still unmoving, and it seemed like she may be out for a little while due to the extent of her injury. That boulder had completely crushed her lower half..

The she-cat worked carefully in order to not cause any further injuries. The ones that young warrior had sustained already looked grave. Wolfshine was no medicine cat, but she thought that Irispetal may be paralyzed.
<em>Don’t think that</em> she thought <em>She’ll be fine</em>
She was already in shock due to Icestar’s demise, and her eyes were still bothersome.
<strong>” Speckleflame, let’s try to lay her on a flat surface until the medicine cat can come look at her”</strong>

Stay where he was... That sounded like a good plan to his ears.  He wasn&#39;t sure he would have had the guts to move even if he had been directed to by the silver point.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Okay, please be careful,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, although his strong words had weakening into muttering as he anxiously watched Icestar&#39;s slow progress down the slope to him.  If she fell, would he be able to catch her?  What if she slipped out of his grasp?  Would he even have much of a grasp while being so... Distracted?  

          Another snap met his earlobes, causing him to freeze, eyes on a significantly large part of the ground above.  The boulder was unexpected, but at the same time he felt he shouldn&#39;t have been surprised by the large rock.  Everything else was falling, why wouldn&#39;t it?  What truly startled him, though, was the pressure that came to his side suddenly.  Gasping, he was pushed backwards.  He felt his side land on a wet piece of ground sticking out of the majority of the deep mud.  He barely managed to focus on what was going on again.  But, he <em>barely</em> managed to; unfortunately, he witnessed everything after he was pushed away.  His eyes met the icey hues of the leader&#39;s for just a moment before her form was completely taken over by the hard flank of the stone.  Everything seemed to freeze besides the tightening in his chest and the frantic towel that left his maw, a louder noise than any that he had made since this all began.  <em><strong><em>&quot;ICESTAR!&quot;</em></strong></em>  The exclamation was tense, full of panic, horror, regret, and more.</span>

            He laid there on his side for a moment, eyes as wide as they could be as he stared at where Icestar had been standing just moments before.  He wasn&#39;t sure how to react.  The only emotion he could truly distinguish was the pain of the guilt that he felt with the knowledge that Icestar had last her life for his own.  Why had she done it?  Her life was so much more necessary than his!  The clan needed her!  He didn&#39;t even know how much she had lost already.  What if this was her last one?  Suddenly, the earth beneath him began to crumble apart with the pressure of the muddy water.  Frantically, he splashed through the water, trying to find some sort of sturdy ground he could use as an island.  He sent one more look to where he had witnessed Icestar&#39;s death before focusing on where Laurelblaze and the rest had seemed safety.  Although his side ached with bruises, he made his way to the temporary refuge and, after some moments, he made it to the top of the rock with the others.  He panted, his eyes watering yet no tears having the confidence to fall.</span>

Another yowl rang out through the chaos that was unfolding. The femme had been trapped by the mud with little to no chance to even react, and it didn&#39;t help that her back leg was still on the road to recovery at this point. She spotted her brother who had made it to safety and called out in panic.

Sandstride came back, moving fairly quickly, jumping over piles of mud and grasses that had been uprooted from the landslide. How much of the camp was destroyed by the landslide? How much was different just off that one horrible swoop?! The dens... the food they had just caught.... any cats left behind... it was horrible, and she didn&#39;t want to think about the mess that would happen afterwards. If the land had already finished destroying the camp, she would do her best to help any cats that had been trapped... or maybe just cleanup. Of course she wasn&#39;t looking forward to it, but it was part of what she needed to do as a warrior of ThunderClan.

She rushed in, looking for any cats she could help dig out, or anybody she could assist... any cats she could save from  the landslide would be good. She didn&#39;t bother sitting around and instead hopped over the luckily stopped slide of mud, looking for any signs of cats...</span>

Hearing the hopeful words that they were almost there, almost to the ledge which would grant them safety, just like how their other clanmates were currently situated on top of it, away from the chaos that seemed to reign down below them. But the moment of light, of something hopeful, slowly was distinguished as she watched in horror when the beloved leader of ThunderClan was...crushed. It was a terrifying sight to behold, and her whole body seemed to freeze to the spot. Did...did their leader just die? She almost could not believe it...but why would StarClan allow such a thing?

Honeydrop was drawn out of her thoughts as Cardinalspark spoke again, knowing he had seen the horrific death just like she had. She felt almost lost for a moment, as if she was unsure what to do or how even to get past this, but every instinct in her body was still reminding her to run. A landslide was still coming at them, and no matter how much she wished she could do something....Icestar was gone. There was a moment of hesitation before she started moving again, making sure the tom was still beside her as they headed to the ledge. How was ThunderClan going to be able to recover from this?

While she’d been overseeing the evacuation of their warriors to the Highledge, she’d been taking shelter somewhere relatively safe from the majority of the chaos. Her spot was elevated, and she’d been guiding her clanmates up the slope in order to get them out of the mess. The deputy had continued to call out to her clanmates so they knew where to retreat to, to seek shelter from the storm as they prepared to weather it out. She prayed the den would be safe enough from the debris. She didn’t know where else they could escape to. The entrances had been blocked off by boulders, earth, and other obstacles lining their path. When this was all said and done, they’d have to clear it in order to head out into the forest. <strong>”Here! Go go go!”</strong> she gestured to her clanmates from above, her tail swaying around behind her as she called to them, trying to catch their attention so they knew where to go once they’d cleared the majority of the debris in their path. She could feel the rain was starting to lighten up, but this was only the beginning, more displaced debris and remnants of dens swept aside from the storm could pose future danger in repair efforts.

<em>Ah hell, that’s going to take forever.</em>

She shook her head as she let out a small grunt of dissatisfaction, shaking her head as she glanced down at her clanmates struggling to get out of the muck. Their cries for help was making her heart ache, and she’d tried to assist those trying to go up the slope as they climbed through more mud and over slick stones as they went. It was precarious, but it was the safest place they could take shelter in. 

Then she heard a loud cry of “Marigolddust!” Belonging to a familiar voice, before it was silenced by a loud <em>CRACK</em> and the sound of mud sloshing around and sealing her away. The deputy’s gaze widened in sheer horror, her pupils narrowing to slits as she let out a loud, shrill cry. <strong>”ICESTAR!”</strong> she yowled for the lynx-point she-cat she’d served as her second-in-command, her throat tightening up as she saw muddy water begin to rise up towards her paws and where she stood. <em>I can’t leave her, she’ll drown! She can’t die here!</em> she shook her head as she let out a growl, before jumping into the muck and slowly trudging over to where the leader had been buried under the stone. <strong>”I’m coming Icestar! Don’t you DARE die on me! I’ll kill you if you die!”</strong> she hissed aloud as she struggled through the current and the debris, but she was not going to stop. <strong>”I’ll get Icestar, everyone else get to the Highledge! You will NOT throw your lives away for me!”</strong> she snarled at her clanmates she could see, insistent on being the one to rescue Icestar, if she even could. She didn’t want anyone to die for her, she refused to let them. The deputy would gladly sacrifice her own life if it meant her clanmates were safe. <strong>”I’m here Icestar! I’ll get you out!”</strong> she wasn’t strong enough to push a boulder of that size, but she could try displacing it by digging out the earth holding it in place. It was wet and easy to manipulate, and she’d been clawing at the earth desperately to free the lynx-point leader from her tomb, her ears flattened against her head as she felt water rush around her paws. <strong>”Come on, come on! LOOSEN ALREADY, DAMN IT!”</strong> she hissed as she continued to scrape at the mud holding the boulder in place, before one particularly loose piece of earth came free and the large rock got swept away, but not without her having to evade it’s path. <strong>”Icestar!”</strong> she could see white fur stained both red and brown, and her heart sank. <strong>”Icestar! Its Laurelblaze, you’re not dying that easily!”</strong>

The warrior didn&#39;t receive much time to recover, as it didn&#39;t take long for his sister&#39;s voice to meet his ears.  Quickly trying to shake off the forming tears, he looked over to meet eyes that matched his in color.  Even more panic sprung up at him.  The Icestar situation had caused more stress to be built on those in danger, and he couldn&#39;t wait to see his sister share the leader&#39;s fate.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Daisyglow!  I&#39;m coming, hold on!&quot;</em></strong></em> He called, his voice shaky as he went as close to the edge as he could manage.  He brought down a paw to try and catch her&#39;s in, hoping that he could help her high enough up to grab her scruff and drag her out of the mud.  It would need some cooperation from both of them, especially since Marigolddust wasn&#39;t the strongest, but he could only hope it would work.

<span class="mention" title="Bronzewing#9200">@Bronzewing</span> 

Sparrowfeather wanted to give up. She couldn’t move. It all seemed too difficult. Everything had always been. Water and mud was in her mouth. She could feel it when her lungs would expand to take a painful breath. She didn’t want to die… not really. But what choice did she have? It was probably impossible for anyone to see her- and who would look under the dirt for her when there were others cats out in the open that needed help? But she couldn’t die… please… not like this. She couldn’t move but she could make noise. She yowled under the debris. Knowing it would make little noise from all the cats scurrying around. But she needed to try… she screamed and yowled. It sounded so loud in her ears. She was going on and on. She went until her throat was hoarse. Until she felt like the earth was enveloping her insides. 

And she went silent again. She tried to kick out… maybe move any dirt above her but she doubted she was successful. She couldn’t breath well anymore. Her vision was clouding up. Which made little difference as  the soil was against her eyes. She found it harder to think…. Her lungs wanted air but she couldn’t do anything about it. She felt her grasp of reality slip away… her eyes lids were already closed and it was dark. And she simply dipped into unconsciousness.</span>

Relief filled her once he grew closer to where she was trapped, and luckily she was close enough to grab onto his paw. At the same time she used most of her strength to try and push herself up with her stronger back leg. Slowly but surely, she was getting free.

Even though he was fairly overwhelmed by... Well, everything, Marigolddust tried to focus as much as possible on his sister.  He was releived that Laurelblaze went to save Icestar&#39;s body Incase she wasn&#39;t yet out of lives, but it was still hard not to focus on what he had seen.  But enough of that- Daisyglow didn&#39;t have multiple lives, and he couldn&#39;t loose her, even if his relationship with the rest of his family wasn&#39;t what you would consider the best.  One front paw had been left to anchor himself, and although he thought he was prepared to pull up Daisyglow, he wasn&#39;t exactly.  He had to unsheath his claws and dig them into the stone&#39;s crevices in order to now be pulled into the mud below.  With a grunt, he pulled up.  Once Daisyglow&#39;s scruff was close enough to him, which seemed to take forever, he bent over and caught a hold of her, using what little remained of his energy to pull her onto the safety zone.

Cardinalspark could hardly believe the tragedy that Thunderclan had undergone in such a short period of time. The flooding was bad, the landslide even worse. He&#39;d thought that there would&#39;ve been a point where they&#39;d be able to catch their breath, retreat to safety and then return. But regardless of where he looked, he only saw signs of trouble, destruction and despair. He had no idea how to react to it all. He merely felt...tired.
    Once reaching the ledge, the tom half-heartedly pulled himself up, turning around to aid Honeydrop if she needed such. His ears drooped, tail dangling just above the ground as he watched Laurelblaze bolt to where their leader had been crushed only moments before. He hoped that somehow, the stars had protected her...but a sickening feeling in his stomach doubted such. All of this had happened...would they be spared in the slightest? As he gazed about, he noticed that Fernpaw was nowhere to be found either. They couldn&#39;t have just lost two important figures among the clan...could they?
    Once Honeydrop had joined him, the tom settled down, a helpless expression upon his face. <strong>&quot;A-Are you alright? Please tell me if something is wrong...&quot;</strong> He asked after a moment, though silently hoping nothing was. <strong>&quot;So much has happened...I don&#39;t know what to make of it.&quot;</strong>

She was trying her best to stay calm, but all her senses were being overwhelmed. She couldn&#39;t help but wince when he grabbed onto her scruff, but thankfully she was now being lifted out, with some assistance from herself.

Marigolddust could hardly hold back his own stressed filled sobs, although the fact that they were going to come at all made him feel shameful.  Nobody else seemed on the verge of crying, so why was he?  It could have easily been because of the fact that he had witnessed a death of a cat important to him because of him, or perhaps it was the lack of knowledge on Fernpaw&#39;s wellbeing or the landslide in general.  Why would this happen?  Couldn&#39;t the cats among the stars that they followed so faithfully have helped them?  Clenching his teeth, he pulled up his sister with a final tug, releasing her from the mud.  He let out a shaky yet releived breath, giving his sister a weak smile to show he was happy they had gotten her out.  Unfortunately, by now he wasn&#39;t capable of putting this or anything else into words.  He just wanted to relax, release all the stress and pain today had brought him, and see Fernpaw again.  He focused hard in order to try and ignore the fallen petals of gold now being carried around by the rubble filled water.  It made him uncomfortable and even more on-edge, why exactly, he wasn&#39;t sure.  Instead, he brushed his cheek against his sister&#39;s to try and pose as a distraction.  Starclan, did he need one.

Everything was so loud, but at least they had eachother. Once she was finally free, she let out a sigh of relief and smiled back. She had to stretch her healing leg for a brief moment to free any strain that this situation might have put on it.

<strong>&quot;Thank you Mari..&quot;</strong> She breathed, returning the same action.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Gracklequiver and Gullykit</div>

As the environment began to rumble, Gullykit&#39;s heart had alrrady started to race. The tense atmosphere. Crashes, crackles, yowls of fear drowning out the ones that were trying to help. He knew it all too well. The flashes of fear in his mother&#39;s eyes and her chokes and gurgles as the overflow of water constricted her throat and lungs. Gullykit and his grandmother had really tried to help, but this just hadn&#39;t been enough. And as the rushes of fear ebbed into his veins, it almost tuned out the cries of his grandmother.

Loose earth, rock, and shredded plants blocked Gullykit&#39;s road to his grandma. &quot;Grammy!&quot; he shrieked, trying to call to her over the immense sounds of panic attacking his ears and sending a high pitched whine into his ears. <em>No, no no no no no!</em> he thought in panic. He didn&#39;t care what his grandmother thought of him - she was the only family he had left and he would not lose her!

Scrabbling desperately through the loose earth, the small tabby tom thrashed through the mud and branches, adrenaline blocking out the pain from the scrapes and scratches and splinters daggering, slicing, and scraping his legs. Before long, he felt the mud rising, and soon his legs were fastened to the ground by the mud as it edged closer to every nook and cranny of ThunderClan&#39;s camp.

<em>NO, NO, NO NO NO</em>
<em>NO!</em>
<em><strong>NO!</strong></em>

All that raced through Gullykit&#39;s mind was just that as the earth surrounded his vision, blacking out his thoughts, filling his nose and throat.

<em>This can&#39;t be happening...</em>

Her heart and whole body weighed heavy with grief as she followed after Cardinalspark onto the ledge, attempting to pull herself up with his help. How could StarClan have let this happen? Were they being punished for something? She did not understand why such tragedy would befall their clan, but she could not help but wonder if there could have been something to stop it.....maybe Icestar would still be here. But it was not only Icestar that they had lost...it was others as well. The clan had suffered a heavy blow, and lost many dear friends to all of them. 

Honeydrop glanced over at the tom when he spoke, listening to his words before nodding slightly in response. <strong>&quot;I am alright. I only got minor scratches. What about you though?&quot;</strong> She asked worriedly, shifting to move around him to inspect his injuries and noticed the wounds on his back from the branch. <strong>&quot;Did you break anything?&quot;</strong> She questioned, wanting to make sure no other part of him was hurt.

The mud dredged his feathery coat, leaving him heavy and bone-tired. Still, though, the warrior returned once more to look for more cats. 
He dug through the earth near where the nursery was- or, had been, rather, he thought bitterly. The warrior gasped as he pulled a kit from the mud. Ignoring the taste of wet earth in his mouth, he desperately carried the kit to somewhere safer.

The sight was unbelievable, his mother, flattened under a large boulder hurled by the torrent of mud and rainwater. He let out a shaky breath as he felt tears begin to form at the rims of his gaze, only to be forcefully snapped back to reality by the voice of Wrenpaw. He sniffed quietly, rubbing his eyes as he tried to bury it, she was right. They couldn’t keep standing here, and supposedly his mother had multiple lives, if she lost one, she’d be okay! She had to be! His stomach was still sinking at that thought, she still died, he witnessed it happen, and she’d be coming back like nothing ever happened.

<em>What a horrible way to live, remembering the pain of all the injuries and illnesses that took your life before.</em>

He turned towards his friend silently, nodding a bit as he tried to breathe. Never had he felt so <em>scared</em> so <em>horrified</em> by what he had seen. How did his mother cope with the physical trauma? Did her body just magically return to it’s former state whenever she lost a life? How would she deal with something like <em>this?</em> Coyotepaw never wished to see something like this, it was too horrific. He was glad he didn’t see any of his siblings around, they might not have seen it happen.

<em>His siblings. His father.</em>

The young tom visibly shuddered, his eyes widening further as he realized his family might have been trapped. Here he was, escaping to safety when they might have been trapped, might have <em>died</em>. <strong>”B-But, my family, they might be-“</strong> he stopped himself from protesting, if he left now, he might put her in danger, he might get them <em>both</em> killed. The best course of action was to keep going, so he could at least keep them both safe. No matter how bad he felt about the whole situation. It was unfair.

<em>Please, if anyone hears this prayer, keep my family safe!</em>

As soon as the young kit was pulled from beneath the thick, rocky earth that had once been beautiful land that had surrounded ThunderClan, the kit began to thrash around, flinging dirt from his pelt and violently coughing and hacking up the thick mud water. The dirt clung onto his eyelashes and stung his sight, tainting it so that only a blurry mess was his point of view.

Once he regained control of his body, he started to cry pitifully hard. &quot;Grammy! Grammy, no! Gramma Gracklequiver is still out there! Let me go! Let...me..!!&quot;

<em><strong><em>&quot;Mhm,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said softly, before his smile faded as he looked around at all of the other cats who needed help.  He mentally and physically didn&#39;t feel able enough to help any of them, plus he felt that if he <em>did</em> try, he wouldn&#39;t get very far when he was this exhausted.  Trying to push down the guilt, he adverted his gaze to the ground under his paws.  As long as they were out of the worst of the ruin, he should be fine... Even if he wished he had the courage to go out and try and help others.  The fact that he helped Daisyglow softened the blow, although not completely.

 <em>W-what was that?</em> His lime shaded optics grew wide as his ears picked up more cries of.. his Clanmates? Panic swelled in him as he drew closer, picking up speed as his ginger tabby pelt dashed through the entrance of camp. Immediately his vision was greeted with frantic cats, foul scented fear scent rushing through his nostrils like a skunk’s gas. It was only then that his mind processed what else he was seeing. Earth. Mud. Everywhere. It was steadily building up - splats of it lapping at his paws. Though none of it registered in his mind as he stood there, frozen in confusion and astonishment, each and every strand of fur prickling on edge. <strong>”Wh-whats happening..”</strong> he alas piped out, shuddering backwards, the wails around him growing louder than anything he’d ever heard before.

Disaster had pounded down on Thunderclan since the skies had begun to weep, perhaps a sign all along that chaos would befall them in the near future. Flooding, a landslide and even death had all happened within this short amount of time, even she couldn&#39;t fathom what had happened nor how she hadn&#39;t gone insane among the destruction that raged about them. Letting out a breath, the tabby worked her way through the brown sea of mud, violet eyes flickering about to locate any struggling felines. For a good while, she believed that she&#39;d be able to make it to safety without a singular thought spared to help another.
    Before long, a cry rang out among those around her, another cry for help among the dozen others. Whiskers quivered slightly, momentarily questioning the idea of seeking out the source before grudgingly doing so. Her gaze landed on an elderly tom, whom seemed to be having some sort of trouble. With a huff, the molly approached him awkwardly. <strong>&quot;Speckleflame.&quot;</strong> she named the tom aloud, moving toward his side. <strong>&quot;Relax. Just walk alongside me and we might get to safety.&quot;</strong> She said to him, wondering how much the injured tom would slow her pace. Hopefully, he wouldn&#39;t end up being the death of them both. Thus, she slowly began moving through the mud again, keeping close to the tom&#39;s side to guide him.

Gullykit&#39;s eyes were pouring tears all of a sudden, from the waves of emotion he was swept up in and because the mud was hurting his eyes. &quot;Grammy was right near me,&quot; he said with a shaky voice and glassy gaze. &quot;Please, you have to help her!&quot;

Gracklequiver, on the other hand, had seen it all. Her grandson&#39;s terrified gaze as the landslide shifted swiftly into ThunderClan&#39;s camp reminded her of her daughter, during a thunderstorm. No matter how much she tried, she hadn&#39;t been able to free herself as the moist earth caved over her, clogging her muzzle of its soily contents and preventing, no, <em>depriving</em> her lungs of any oxygen.

She had tried, she really did, to free herself. Claws scraping against the dirt that seemed to get thicker as she fought it, and thrashing around like a worm to find any opening. Anything at all.

At this point, the frail she&#39;s energy, her <em>life</em>, was draining out of her. She was so..exhausted. All she could do was accept her fate.

<em>Canyonstream, here I come.</em>

<em>...what?</em>
Gracklequiver felt the pressure on her body loosen, the pain start to ebb away, and her body start to support her then. Her already hazy sight was poisoned by the landslide, but she could see a faint shape as the mud on top of her cleared.

The elder&#39;s breaths were weak, but she gave a choke as her gag reflex seemed to activate again and she coughed up that disgusting mud that had been plaguing her body. She was free. Free!

As he saw Larkplume pull a very confused and fatigued Gracklequiver out of the earth, hope flared in Gullykit&#39;s chest. She was okay! She was <em>alive!</em>

The tabby sighed inwardly at the slow pace, a sense of urgency beginning to nag at her. Her gaze flickered about for a moment, before falling upon the tragic event of their leader being crushed by a boulder. Hollowgrove blinked, flicking an ear at the tom&#39;s question. <strong>&quot;Quite. You&#39;ll have to be ready to climb though.&quot;</strong> she replied, leading the tom towards the ledge. How they&#39;d managed to get up there was beyond her, but alas...she had to try.

Hollowgrove soon led the tom to the base of the ledge, eyes narrowing as she tried to think of a way to get the tom to safety. <strong>&quot;Alright. Boost yourself up on my shoulder, use the rest of the rock to hold yourself up. Grip it well.&quot;</strong> The molly stated. <strong>&quot;You&#39;ll have to feel around for the top, if you&#39;re able to, then do your best to pull yourself up.

The feline grimaced slightly due to the weight, hopefully no one was paying them any mind. Probably not, considering recent events. Once the tom had made it onto the ledge, the molly turned and leapt up herself, grabbing the edge and hoisting herself up. Her whiskers twitched, turning to the blind tom. <strong>&quot;There. Are you well? Besides...being blind.&quot;</strong>

She scratched at the mud, claws sharp and getting caked with dirt before they were no longer effective- she took a second to clean them by rubbing them against the ground before she got back to work trying to free any cat she could see. It wasn&#39;t easy to do, and she could sometimes hear cats in her mind and scratch at the ground when nobody was there- or was somebody, and she was leaving the site of another trapped cat? Sandstride had no idea. But she did hear one faint yowl and rushed over, digging at the ground with heavy breaths before she found the area right above the cat- the noises were right below her.

She tapped on the earth above before digging, making sure the cat held on for a bit longer before she could haul them up. Her paws were tired, and she was moving at a slower pace- 

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Pinefoot | Helping</div>

He rushed into camp, realizing what had happened. His thick fur quickly got soiled with mud as he plunged into the dirt, scratching to reveal dens and whatever was left of the fresh-kill pile, tearing things apart with heavy claws... he was a stronger cat, built for the fight and not speed, and the dirt gave way to his claws. He was tired, barely able to move a lot of the time, but after his many days of constant patrols he had more stamina than he would expect from himself. 

He noticed Sandstride and moved over to help, picking up where the tired tan cat had left off, tearing apart grasses and twigs and the wings of birds- he wondered where his own bird had gone- before he finally saw a scrap of a cat, breathing, alive, unconscious. He ducked his head in, picking up the cat, the dirt making them hard to recognize especially in his frenzied state. And he turned back to Sandstride, but she was already digging at another spot. Guess he should get this cat out of here at least, and he started to move.</span>

The tabby rolled her eyes, before letting out a breath. <strong>&quot;Well, I&#39;m no medicine cat, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll all go away with time. For now...we&#39;ll have to wait until some of this chaos dies down. in the meantime, you can rest a bit.&quot;</strong>

Wrenpaw didn’t know what to do or what to say. All she knew was that she felt horrible for her friend, and that she would do anything within her power to help him. Realistically there wasn’t much that she could do, but that had never stopped her before, and it certainly wouldn’t now. If Coyotepaw had asked her to leap back into the landslide to go look for the rest of his family, she wouldn’t hesitate. Of course, she knew he’d never ask her to do such a thing. The familiar feeling of helplessness settled in; a feeling that Wrenpaw hated more than anything. Deep down she knew that there was nothing she could do to make Coyotepaw’s current situation any better. She couldn’t bring his mother back, she couldn’t hunt down the rest of his family, and she couldn’t find the words to comfort him because those words probably didn’t exist. After all, how do you comfort someone after something like that? So much loss and so much grief hung in the air around her, she felt as though she might collapse under the weight of it all. How many other clanmates would they bury after this was all said and done? The one thing she could be grateful for was that she and her friend had made it safely onto the Highledge. After that, everything else was uncertain. 

She lay her tail upon his shoulders once more, and pressed gently against his side in a feeble attempt to comfort him. <strong>”Hey, it’s gonna be okay.”</strong> Was it? She didn’t even think she believed the words that had come out of her mouth, so why would he? <strong>”Maybe it won’t be okay, but I’ll be here no matter what. And I promise you that I’ll help you find the rest of your family. Okay? I promise.”</strong> She said. Sighing heavily, she scanned what was left of the clearing with somber amber eyes. Her home didn’t even look like home anymore. Every den had been ripped apart and washed away, and the large amounts of mud and debris and floodwater made everything else look</span>

Icestar’s prone body remained still underneath the thick sludge. She was long gone. The shrieks of anguish and Laurelblaze’s threatening snarls did not reach her ears. Just like with the lives she had lost before, the silvery-white molly was slowly healing from the injuries obtained from the collision. However, if she wasn’t rescued soon, another life would soon be lost from suffocating amidst the mud.

<em>Icestar!</em> She finally heard her name being called again as she returned to her body. She instantly felt cool air brushing against parts of her fur as Laurelblaze slowly recovered her bit by bit. While her wounds were no more, blood splattered along her fur in gruesome ways, mixing in with the mud that coated her body. 

She couldn’t respond yet or struggle to escape. Not when her senses still haven’t fully returned. <em>Hurry up!</em> She thought angrily, wishing to thrash until she got out.

Sparrowfeathers head lolled to the side as she was roughly picked up from the debris. As soon as her body hit the air and was moved away her eye lids snapped open, blinking rapidly to move the dirt away from her eyes on an instinct as Sparrowfeather began to cough up dirt and mud from her mouth.  Taking in stuttering gasps of air. But she wasn’t allowed to breath long. She was picked up quickly and rushed over to the safe area the camp had made away from the wreckage. She was still taking in grateful breaths.

She finally got a good look at the cat that had lead her out- to her knowledge anyway. <strong>”Pinefoot!”</strong> she chocked. <strong>”You’re okay!”</strong> He was barely recognizable because of the soil that almost covered his pelt. She couldn’t feel any pain yet and wasn’t sure if she was hurt. But she still stumbled forward weakly. <strong>”Is Sandstride okay?”</strong> she meowed worriedly. She looked to the anxious meows of their clanmates. Already dealing with wounded cats and bowed over the dead quietly. Sparrowfeather looked at the scene with shock before realizing that more cats were probably still trapped. <strong>”Pinefoot- what can I do to help? Are there more trapped? What’s going on!”</strong> she doubted he had any more answers than her but she wanted to know so badly.</span>

The rain was starting to soften up, and the dark storm clouds were beginning to part above to reveal bright blue skies ahead. Light was streaming through these cracks in the clouds, almost dramatically like they were spotlights upon the figures in the camp. Yet it also revealed just how much devastation this storm had wrought upon the camp. The dens were buried under earth, some likely being completely destroyed from the rubble. Laurelblaze could see the branches and ferns that were sticking out of the mud at odd angles, the nursery was lost for sure. <em>I pray everyone got out of there, if we lost any kits in this storm, it’d be tragic…</em> she winced at the thought, before she stared down at Icestar at her paws. Her body was looking less-mangled than she would have expected from a boulder landing on a cat. Yet she still didn’t appear conscious, the injury must have been bad, <strong>”After something like that, she must have lost a life… I gotta get her to safety.”</strong>

Laurelblaze crouched down into the mud and picked up the lynx-point leader by her scruff with her teeth and pulled her out of the muck. She then crouched again underneath the paler-toned she-cat and hauled her over her shoulders. It was better than being dragged over debris, and she could keep her nose above the water and mud in case she ever regained her breath. Staying down here even when the storm was ending wasn’t a good idea, they had to wait and make sure everything was stable before daring to enter camp and attempt repair efforts. The clan lost a majority of their dens to the crumbling earth and the mud, and she could see even from here the entrances to camp were sealed. Nobody could get in, and nobody could get out. They’d starve to death if they didn’t get to work on that right away so they could get supplies funneled in, that was to be a priority, aside from rescue efforts.

<em>But if someone got caught under the mud and debris by now, we’d just be retrieving bodies.</em>

She squeezed her eyes shut at the thought, she hadn’t seen any of her kits or her mate during this entire ordeal, and it was killing her. She prayed they were still out on patrol or somehow made it to the Highledge where they’d be safe. They needed to do a headcount to be sure. 

Laurelblaze began to ascend the steps to the Highledge with Icestar hanging over her shoulders, being careful not to jostle her in this sensitive state she was in. She’d likely wake up momentarily, but she wanted to be courteous to her at this time. Getting a life taken away was always an arduous ordeal, and she had to be gentle about it. Once she’d stepped up to the ledge that jutted out from the leader’s den, Laurelblaze slipped Icestar off her shoulders and softly placed her against the ground. Here, she could recover without worrying about suffocating. <strong>”We got you, Icestar, don’t take too long though because you might worry a lot of cats.”</strong>

A familiar voice echoed from the top of the quarry. Needlestripe crouched there, a paw outstretched down towards his clanmates. He&#39;d opened up a small hole in the barrier, enough to haul cats through to safe ground but not permitting debris that would hurt them. At least, he kicked away the branches that rammed into his back, water spilling around him.

His voice and tabby figure were muted behind the sheets of rain, but his eyes were intent on the white she-cat. <strong>&quot;Bring her up to me, you&#39;ll be safer up here.&quot;</strong> A crumbling wall was no place for an injured cat and her rescuer.

It was on this fateful day that the bad omens gathered into one collective disaster - a landslide, and while Tigerpaw was lucky to have gotten out of it mostly unscathed, she wandered frantically at the top of the camp now, searching for her most precious clanmates.

While not one to usually want to stay in camp, Jayfang absolutely despised rain and water. He hated the feeling of wet fur slowing him down, and would do anything to avoid it. After arriving back at camp from that patrol where they found the very peculiar dead bodies that Jayfang hadn&#39;t thought about much, he swiftly lunged for one of the dens to take shelter in. He hadn&#39;t even thought about which den, just the nearest one with sturdy walls that surely wouldn&#39;t collapse. And for the most part, he was right. The walls of the den hadn&#39;t collapsed. But the walls of the <em>camp</em> did. Mud and dirt fell into camp, and though Jayfang tried to run out of the den to escape the landslide—he&#39;d prefer to be wet than to suffocate—but he wasn&#39;t fast enough, and the dirt caught him within it.

The pale white warrior was tending to Irispetal when her ears suddenly pricked at an all too familiar voice. Joy surged through her as she spotted Needlestripe on top of the cliff. Finally, she had felt less alone. Her earlier thoughts of motherly longing faded. A friend had made that better… or maybe something more…

She shook her head and grabbed the young warrior by the scruff.  Irispetal was still unconscious, which made the job even more difficult. Wolfshine hauled her up to where the Tom was standing, hoping he could grab hold of her.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">A scowl was painted across the large silver tabby’s face as he trudged through mud that was up to his underbelly, creating a rather loud sucking sound every time he took a step. <strong>”Mousedung!”</strong> He spat. Despite his aggravation, his silver gaze glittered with worry as he struggled through the mud and debris. He had been outside of the camp hunting when the landslide had happened, and came back to witness the entire camp destroyed. Most of his clanmates seemed to be okay up on the Highledge, but right now he didn’t really care about them. He hasn’t seen Tigerpaw since the morning of the landslide, and he was worried sick. She wasn’t inside the camp, that had to mean that she was safe, right? He prayed to StarClan that she hadn’t succumbed to the floodwaters or the deep blankets of mud that had consumed everything. 

Large black ears swiveled upon his skull as a faint voice was carried across the breeze, and hope flared within his chest. <strong>”Tigerpaw! Tigerpaw!”</strong> He howled, clawing his way faster through the muck towards the sound of her voice. He paused again, chest heaving as his breath came in rapid pants. Again, he heard the sweet melody of her voice, closer this time. He carried on until finally the molly was finally in his sights, relief flooding over him to see that aside from being caked in mud, she looked okay. He pressed his nose into her cheek, a deep purr rumbling in his throat. <strong>”Tigerpaw, I’m so glad you’re okay!”</strong> <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

The thick brown cat breathed in heavily, tired after his work- he didn&#39;t speak much, conserving his breath for the digging. He was a mess, not covered in as much dirt as some of the trapped cats but still a deeper brown than his usual ruddy pelt due to the mud inside it. He wouldn&#39;t even groom that- he would probably dip into the lake, honestly. This was so bad that he would prefer water over having his tongue touch even a bit of this. He watched the cat he had rescued breathe before he started to pad back to the dirt.

He turned his head back to answer their questions, at the same time eyes darting around to find more and more possible cats to dig out. <strong>&quot;Sandstride is helping to dig out more cats. She&#39;s fine, albeit as tired and muddy as I am.</strong> he meowed. <strong>There are more trapped, but you don&#39;t need to worry about it. You should be getting to a medicine cat, or at least resting.</strong> He looked back towards Sandstride, who was already working on getting another cat free.

<em>Were the rest of the cats still alive?</em> he wondered, but even if they were not, he would at least get their bodies back to the Clan for vigil.</span>

Sparrowfeather knew she wasn’t fit for going out and helping but she still felt an immense amount of guilt staying back as Pinefoot went back into the mess of the camp. She couldn’t bother Fernpaw- she has no idea where the she-cat even was. And other cats needed help much more than she did. She tried to focus on taking in large breaths. Amazed how easy it was to breath. She had taken it for granted…

She looked around, seeing how filthy and distressed every cat was, like her, had either gotten out as everything collapsed or was saved. Her mind wasn’t even focusing on how bad it was to be trapped under the Earth. It was almost like she had made it out when everyone else did. And that’s what she told herself. To shove away the image of boulders falling on cats and covering her vision. She gingerly stood up. But that was enough in itself- she gave a painful gasp- her side was jabbing her- like someone has taken a rock and was grinding it against her ribs. 

She couldn’t rest either. Her adrenaline was so high that her mind was buzzing. Casting a sad glance at the camp she resulted to trying to help the cats in the pitiful huddle as much as she could. Very slowly making her way to grab moss, drench it in a nearby stream of water and giving it to anyone who needed it. Which was a lot of cats…</span>

[Jayfang]

While not one to usually want to stay in camp, Jayfang absolutely despised rain and water. He hated the feeling of wet fur slowing him down, and would do anything to avoid it. After arriving back at camp from that patrol where they found the very peculiar dead bodies that Jayfang hadn&#39;t thought about much, he swiftly lunged for one of the dens to take shelter in. He hadn&#39;t even thought about which den, just the nearest one with sturdy walls that surely wouldn&#39;t collapse. And for the most part, he was right. The walls of the den hadn&#39;t collapsed. But the walls of the <em>camp</em> did. Mud and dirt fell into camp, and though Jayfang tried to run out of the den to escape the landslide—he&#39;d prefer to be wet than to suffocate—but he wasn&#39;t fast enough, and the dirt caught him within it.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Following her question, the tom looked himself over, appalled with his own appearance. As far as injuries, it was hard to tell beneath all of the mud that clung to his long pelt. His claws felt sore from tearing through the sodden earth, and he was certain the stinging he felt on his flanks and sides were scratches from branches and other debris. Aside from that, and the fact that his pelt felt as heavy as stones, he felt okay. <strong>”I think I’m fine. I’m sore.. I’m tired, but I’m alright. I’m better now,”</strong> he said, not hesitating to rasp his tongue softly over her head. It was a little muddy, sure, but he didn’t care. He had grown a lot more comfortable with showing her affection lately, especially now after being so worried about her. The silver tom wasn’t sure what he would have done if he couldn’t have found her, or worse, if he’d found her dead somewhere. 

His silver gaze was clouded as he peered down over the camp. What once had been there home was unrecognizable. The amount of time and strength that it was going to take to rebuild seemed like an impossible task. <strong>”Everything is ruined. I don’t even know how we will get back inside camp,”</strong> he said, flattening his ears in frustration. And how was he going to get all this mud off of himself? He certainly didn’t fancy jumping into a stream, nor did the like the idea of grooming it all off. This was absolutely awful. Had it not been for Tigerpaw at his side, his mood surely would have been <em>much</em> worse. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

Where… where do you want to go?”</strong> He relished in the warmth of her body as she pressed up against him, even though they were both muddy and soaking wet. He had to admit, he didn’t want to go back to camp that badly either. It was in ruins, and without a doubt he knew that the apprentices den was destroyed along with everything else. There wasn’t even a warm dry nest to go back to. 

The day was still young, and the storm seemed to be blowing away after weeks of downpour. He supposed they could go anywhere, if they really wanted to. Of course their clanmates would probably expect the worst if they just disappeared like that. Juniperpaw felt rather unsure about their current situation, but there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t do for Tigerpaw. If she didn’t want to go back, then they wouldn’t be going back. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

He barely had the energy to care anymore. He was famished and exhausted, and more than anything he just wanted to get dry, clean, and to lay down beside Tigerpaw. 

At least the rain had finally subsided. Perhaps that would give them some chance at drying off. Juniperpaw felt like he hadn’t been dry in moons. He followed close behind Tigerpaw as she led them to a hollowed out tree. His legs felt shaky, but more than ever he was determined to show Tigerpaw that he could take care of her. <strong>”Maybe I can find us something to eat,”</strong> he suggested, sitting down under the tree. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

But she wasn&#39;t about to turn down his offer. <strong>&quot;Sure,&quot;</strong> her mew was weary but clearly grateful.

He hoped that everything would be okay, but in the face of so much destruction it was hard to imagine things going back to normal. <strong>”I’ll be back soon. Maybe I can find something on higher grounds,”</strong> he said before disappearing into the undergrowth. 

The rains may have gone, but hunting was still just as bad as Juniperpaw had expected. All he managed to catch was a vole, and by the time he returned to the tree where Tigerpaw was, he was more exhausted than ever. He dropped the vole down at her paws, flopping down beside her. <strong>”Better than nothing, I suppose,”</strong> he said, resting his head on his paws. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

It wasn&#39;t long before he returned, but long enough.

Her striped back was turned to the cold forest and she hadn&#39;t moved from the position she&#39;d taken when he set out. To his comment she didn&#39;t respond. The only sound from her were coarse raspy breaths, and her pelt radiated uncanny heat.

Juniperpaw had no knowledge of herbs and he had no clue if he could find Fernpaw. She probably had enough injured cats to deal with as it was. He couldn’t deny the rising panic in his chest. 

He nestled closer to her, wrapping his fluffy tail around her and pushing the vole a bit closer to her face. <strong>”Come on, you should eat something. You gotta keep your strength up. Do you, uh… do you know any herbs?”</strong> He knew it was probably unlikely that she did, but at this point he would take his chances. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

Gullykit watched, relief easing his soul and spreading throughout his body to relax his muscles, sheathe his claws which were digging into the ground, and calm his racing heart down. Thank StarClan - his grandmother was alive!

Gracklequiver shifted slightly on the ground, relieved to have her small, wrinkled paws plantex back on solid ground, though she shivered at the sight of her beloved camp that had been ruined by this horrid landslide. Though, she was suddenly distracted from her thoughts as Gullykit skittered up to her and hugged her ankle tightly. She gave a raspy breath outward, starting to groom her grandson&#39;s fur which was caked with dirt. She decided to answer Larkplume&#39;s question for Gullykit, as he seemed too fixed on loving on Gracklequiver.

&quot;He&#39;s the only one in his litter,&quot; Gracklequiver rasped, looking back down at Gullykit with an emotional gaze. &quot;His father, Nighthiss, was convinced he was..&quot; She cut off, lowering her voice to a whisper in hopes it was out of earshot of Gullykit. Leaning slightly forward, she continued. &quot;..Cursed.&quot;</span>

Relief washed over her as Irispetal was lifted to safety. As long as the warrior was safe, that’s all that mattered.

She looked back at Needlestripe as he urged her to trust him. There was no doubt in her mind. She immediately reached over with her paws, hoping he would be able to get her out.

A cat with no sense of smell was the last one you&#39;d teach herbs to. And even if she could recognize them by sight, everything in the forest and in camp was trashed by now. With Fernpaw missing, her outlook was grim.

Tigerpaw groaned in pain and gripped her stomach, brow furrowed over closed eyes. She shivered despite her fever. StarClan, did they really need anymore problems? <span class="mention" title="tremb#3692">@tremb</span></span>

He turned to Irispetal and groomed the unconscious she-cat&#39;s fur for a moment before eyeing Wolfshine again. <strong>&quot;Have you seen Foxpaw anywhere?&quot;</strong> he asked her, his demeanor calm but concern clear beneath the outside.

Why did she have to get sick on the day of the landslide? If it had been any other day he could have simply fetched the medicine cat for her and it would have been out of his paws. He sighed heavily, curling closer to the dark tabby and rasping his tongue over her fur in an attempt to clean it. 

<strong>”It’s gonna be fine, don’t worry. Just rest. I’ll figure something out,”</strong> he promised. His eyes were growing heavy with exhaustion, and he wanted nothing more than to just sleep. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

Gracklequiver, her body still quite weak from the fight with the landslide, nodded wordlessly, hesitating for a moment to look down at Gullykit who was still clinging onto her paw. She lingered behind for a moment, to clamp the young tom&#39;s scruff gently, yet firmly in her jaws to swing him up into the air and in between her bony shoulderblades.

&quot;So, where are we sheltering for now?&quot; the elder asked with a wheezy voice, doing her best to catch up with Larkplume.</span>

She could see the rain clearing up from above, but as Marbledpaw desperately tried to scramble up the mud that had barraged through the apprentice&#39;s den, she found herself stuck, teeth gritting in concentration as she braved through the pelting rain, tail lashing as claws scraped the rocks leading out of camp. 

She had ran back into the apprentice&#39;s den in a mad scramble to retrieve the kestrel feather that had dislodged from her tail and by the time where she had peered outwards the camp&#39;s situation was a complete mess, mud and rocks everywhere.

She was nearly out when boulders started to crash from behind, a whine creaking from the top of camp. The calico turned with violets wide as something dark and brown and <em>fast</em> swung violently towards her. It missed only to crash her exit.

Ears flattened and claws dug into the dirt below. <strong>&quot;Kestrel-&quot;</strong> she wasn&#39;t here. <strong>&quot;Fernpaw? Jayfang-&quot;</strong>

No one was here, either too busy getting stuck or somewhere far away. And finally~

<strong>&quot;<em>Rooksnap!</em>&quot;</strong> came the yell, ears pressed against her cranium as the mud fell over her paws - her last attempt for some sort of help being her nanny, having being entrusted Marbledpaw&#39;s kithood and despite the fights, the gut reaction jerked the name out her throat as a cry for help.</span>

The she cat panted as she finally made it up to the ledge. Her head was spinning at the revelation at what she just witnessed. One moment everything was calm… and then chaos broke lose. Oh Icestar… poor Icestar.

Needlestripe’s question snapped her from her thoughts.
<strong>” Oh no I’m sorry, I haven’t seen Foxpaw.”</strong>
Her eyes scanned around the camp. Her ears pinned back when she realized she couldn’t see any apprentices.
<strong>” Oh Juniperpaw! My apprentice! I hope he’s alright too”</strong>
She was soaking wet, and very cold. She shivered as worry overtook her.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">She had been at her parents&#39; graves when it all started.

Rooksnap&#39;s visits to the edge of the territory had been more frequent lately. She almost spent more time there than in camp or around her clanmates. The recent storms had her worried about the integrity of those special tombs, but she couldn&#39;t ignore the yowls of cats and crashing of nature when it echoed through the forest that day.

She was quick on her feet, for being so short in stature and weighed down by the water logged in her thick chocolate pelt. The closer she got to camp, the more sure she was that something was wrong. And she was right. Rooksnap&#39;s gut had never betrayed her.

<em>Landslide.</em>

A simple thought to describe the chaos she saw when she arrived at the top of the crumbling quarry. When the nanny&#39;s figure appeared, it stood there for a moment, but it didn&#39;t take long for her to realize that cats were in danger - cats <em>she loved</em> were in danger. Jayfang was being sucked into the mud, Marbledpaw trapped behind rubble- <em>Oh dear..-</em>

<strong>&quot;Hang on! I&#39;m coming!..&quot;</strong> her yell was drowned by the sound of the pounding rain. Rooksnap pelted down into the clearing, sliding down the path that had fallen. After a few bounds she was pulling Jayfang up by the scruff, and in a few more she&#39;d reached Marbledpaw and dug her out with big grizzly paws.

A lost looking Blaze was herded by the munchkin she-cat and received a lick to the eyes to restore his soiled sight. When they were huddled close, Rooksnap took the lead up the rocky path to high ledge which would eventually lead them to safety- <strong>&quot;...as long as we stick together. Now, one at a time and we&#39;ll-&quot;</strong>

<em>RRRRRRRRRRREEEGH...</em>

Dread dropped in Rooksnap&#39;s chest. Her odd eyes floated up to where-

<em>CRASH</em>

Another set of rocks came lose from the camp wall and was falling straight for the trio.

<em><strong>&quot;Watch out!!!&quot;</strong></em>

Wild eyed, Rooksnap barreled into all three cats, wide armed, and sent them tumbling out of the way.

Only to be buried, beneath the fall.</span>

The tom was disorented- The landslide had caught most of the clan off guard, that included the onrey tom who wouldn&#39;t take on the ridiculous &#39;paw&#39; suffix that his siblings had out of spite after Rooksnap turned on him and his siblings. 

Mud blinded him briefly and he felt a tongue clear his vision just in time to be shoved out of the way as the rocks came down, he rolled. &quot;Hey! Watch It-&quot; To his horror, he watched as the rocks crushed Rooksnap. &quot;N-No!&quot; He cried out. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span> <span class="mention" title="-Swift-#3184">@-Jayfang-</span> <span class="mention" title="cake#9694">@cake</span></span>

Until Rooksnap arrived, Jayfang had been twisting around in the mud, trying his best to wiggle his way out. However, being dragged out was a huge relief. Spitting out the mud that had got in his mouth and rubbing his eyes, he looked up to who had saved him. To his surprise, it had been Rooksnap. &quot;Huh. Thanks.&quot;

Now she hurried him, and two other cats up the high ledge. &quot;Isn&#39;t this just for the leader?&quot; he pointed out, though he didn&#39;t waste any time following her. Mud clogged his ears a little, and though he was trying his best to get some of it out, he wasn&#39;t able to hear the rocks tumbling down. Jayfang was going to keep walking, until he was shoved and promptly fell quite far down the path, nearly to the bottom. He leaped back to his feet at once. &quot;Hey! What gives-&quot; but his thoughts were cut off as he noticed the rocks covering where they had once been, and Rooksnap missing. Immediately, he darted up towards it, and tried his best to shove aside the smaller rocks. &quot;What are you doing? Help me!&quot; he ordered the two apprentices.

Although he himself was in safety, it was made clear that more than half of the clan seemed to be in a very different situation.  Even though he felt desperate to help at least one if them, he knew that in the jambled state he was in it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea.  But, he hardly knew the majority out there in the ruin, unable to escape from danger alone.  The only voice calling for help that he knew well was Marbledpaw, and then Rooksnap&#39;s.  A sudden sense of dread began to intrude on everything; his thoughts, his posture, his desperate wishes.  He couldn&#39;t exactly hear what they each were saying, but he knew that at least one of them had to be in danger.  Despite the sour treatment he received from Rooksnap recently, he found his eyes searching through the muddied rubble for both.  It took a moment, but he finally caught sight of them.  It seemed like Rooksnap was pulling the younger fem out of rubble, and more familiar faces came into view as she unblinded and assisted Jayfang.  He sighed in relief, more than pleased to see that they all got out safely.  

          Unfortunately, he was meeting assumptions too soon.  As he was turning around to search for any other cats he was close to, he heard his nanny yowl.  The high pitched demand caused him to quickly to his attention back to the group, just in time to see the falling docks heading straight towards them.  Although only one cat was exchanged for three, his heart immediately dropped, feeling as if it were twisting up on itself.</span>

His lungs hurt from the desperate yell, but the tears that had been held back didn&#39;t fall because of that.  His tail went slightly under and between his legs, fear displayed stronger than before on his features as he frantically tried to figure out a way the nanny could still be alive.  This could happen, not again!  He hadn&#39;t made amends with her yet, and now she might be just as gone as his mother had been.  He couldn&#39;t hold back the trembling of his lip as more tears fell from his eyes to the already wet stone below, Fernpaw&#39;s absence, the stress of witnessing and causing Icestar to loose a life, and finally Rooksnap&#39;s demise all finally getting to him.

One minute she was shaking and read to accept that she was possibly going to die, and the second she was flying through the air after brown fur shoved them across camp.

She landed crookedly on one. leg, crashing and stumbling onto safety when a grumble sounded and Rooksnap..

<strong>&quot;Rook,&quot;</strong> the soft whisper of an exhale escaped her, tail quivering as she held her feather close - she hated her, she hated her, she
    got saved by her, and Marbledpaw practically killed her in the end by bringing her in the mess. The brown tabby&#39;s name was yelled across camp by several, but all she could do was to stumble towards where a blurry vision of denial over Jayfang&#39;s sharp demand and rushed over to him, paws tripping over each other. Where the rocks were safe, shaky paws brushed over the two smallest ones before ramming herself on the larger ones trying to wedge a gap.

<strong>&quot;Rooksnap! Can you hear me? Rook-.. can you-..&quot;</strong> her voice broke as her body failed her after a slam into the rock failed again, ears flattened backwards and rain above decorating the sunbeams that weaved into her tears below, chest heaving as the overwhelming belief she murdered her nanny after giving her that scar because of her sick, sardonic heart sprung again, herself shaking sharply and jerking backwards as if it would throw the thought away. A claw wedged into the jagged line split against the rocks, staring down with violets wild with a desperate hope her nanny would pop out of the shadow and crack a joke. 

Marbledpaw couldn&#39;t stop pawing desperately at the smaller rocks even when the larger ones failed, shoving them apart and peering in distress for some sign from StarClan of life.</span>

Dead. Her tears got clogged in her throat and to her the droplets that pelted her fur wet was nothing - or maybe it had thinned out to a drizzle, she wasn&#39;t sure. When she got a wet tuft of her fur that was waterlogged and muddied, Marbledpaw snatched it, slipping it under her claw. The revolving thought of laughter chortling in her ear singing <em>dead, dead, dead, dead, dead</em> fell down rapidly and the thoughts that danced in her eyes fogged up one by one, from everyone and herself till all she could hear was the ringing in her ears directing her to... <em>safety.</em> She couldn&#39;t die. 

She stumbled back up to where everyone else was and stared at the one cat up there - Marigolddust. <strong>&quot;She&#39;s dead,&quot;</strong> she informed, simply.</span>

The injured molly had almost given up on hope of finding her brother, and was rested against the outline of a boulder, observing the blood that stained her entire leg, and the muddy water that barely soaked up to the top of her heels. She looked slightly dejected, but the bi-color never usually let anything get to her too bad - she often stayed quite strong in the face of danger. Hah, and those clan cats.. some of them hadn’t survived. 

As the apprentice lifted her head, she saw a very worried Marigolddust peering over the edge and through the rubble. Maybe he’s found something! Maybe Blaze was okay.. Hobbling over almost excitedly, Cloverpaw then began peeking over the edge too. “<strong>What-</strong>” She noticed Rooksnap, who had come back.. also Jayfang, Marbledpaw, and Blaze! “<strong>They’re alive,</strong>” came a breath of relief towards Marigolddust. Yet, perhaps Cloverpaw had spoken too soon.

She watched as the brown she-cat leaped and shoved all three cats aside with baited breath and then… the cry of Marigolddust rang in her ears, but Cloverpaw was silent as she watched. Not one single cry or gasp escaped her chest. What had just happened? The world seemed to go numb around her. 

“<strong>No!</strong>” she suddenly yelled. “<strong>You have to get out the way, you guys! Move! Before more rocks come!</strong>” she called in protest to Jayfang’s desperation. Only <em>one</em> of them was allowed to die today.

Pinefoot rushed back over to help dig out some more cats- most of the felines had already been taken out, and it was mostly the dens and loose fresh-kill that was still being salvaged. He heard concerned voices and  panic, and so he hoped that cats had already been dragged out of there... anybody still stuck was most likely dead by now. He didn&#39;t want to imagine the vigils they would be having for all these cats.

What would they do with the camp now? It was a disaster, mud and clumps of grasses everywhere, the dens destroyed... they could rebuild the dens of course, but how would they get the mass of dirt out of there? It would take many paws, and with the injured and tired cats they had, it would be a while until they could really start on it.

Scratching at the earth again he uncovered the torn wings of birds, whatever was left of their prey- definitely not something they could eat, so he threw it to the side and kept working. Looking up at Sandstride, she was still exhausted beyond belief- he was tempted to tell her to take a break, but had a feeling that the she-cat would refuse. No use wasting his breath.</span>

He kept shoving rock after rock out of the way. Even when he was told she was dead, he persisted. &quot;She can&#39;t be dead. You must be mistaken,&quot; he denied, pawing aside every stone in the way. &quot;It&#39;s only a few rocks.&quot; Desperately, he kept moving the rocks until he found Rooksnap&#39;s body, tattered and very much dead. 

He stared at the corpse for a few seconds in disbelief before grabbing her scruff and trying to drag her body out of the rubble. Jayfang managed to move a little of it, but not very much. Eventually, he gave up on trying to move her, and just looked at her with sorrow. 

Then came rage. &quot;Of course, she&#39;s dead. Couldn&#39;t even stay alive long enough for me to save her,&quot; he hissed. Absolutely outraged, he leaped down from the high ledge. &quot;There&#39;s no where safe in this camp,&quot; Jayfang huffed. &quot;Where to, now?&quot;

The clouds had finally parted, only shreds of the dark nimbus clouds remained in the all-too-mockingly blue skies above the camp. The rain was replaced by harsh sun, and the mud and earth slowly begun to come to a stop, the devastation highlighted by the rays of the sun like it was a spotlight upon a stage. Overturned rocks and boulders remained, and the mud slowly began to harden in place, like clay drying in the sun. It was over for now, but they had a great challenge ahead of them. The camp was utterly destroyed, and from where the deputy stood upon the Highledge, she could see every entrance was blocked, ThunderClan’s warriors were trapped. 

Laurelblaze stared down at the body of their leader at her paws, no sign of consciousness just yet, but she had a feeling she’d get up soon. She knew Icestar was sturdier than she looked, she might have lost a life here, but that was not going to do her in. She had faith in her, she wasn’t getting stuck leading the clan without her while they had <em>this</em> mess to clean up. They had enough on their plate without power being shifted from one cat to another. <strong>”Wake up soon, seriously, this place is a mess.”</strong> the tortoiseshell murmured as she gazed upon the wreckage, her eyes darkening at the sight. <em>How do we even begin with this? Everything is just…</em>

Her line of thought had been interrupted by the sounds of wailing cats, and the sound of a name she didn’t expect to hear. <em>Rooksnap!</em> her eyes darted to the camp below, where cats were clustered around a large boulder that had come loose and were desperately trying to claw out. <strong>”Don’t tell me she-“</strong> her voice cut off, and her heart sank down in her chest, a choked-up noise escaping her throat as she overheard the confirmation… Her friend was dead.

She wasn’t going to allow any more of them to die today, not when Rooksnap gave her life for them!

<strong>”All of you! In the camp! Get to the Highledge! Its still unstable, get to safety now!”</strong> she called down to the group of apprentices and warriors down below, her voice commanding and stern. Even if it was masking her own grief, she had to be strong in the face of it all.

Guiltily, Marigolddust had completely forgotten about Cloverpaw, mainly because she hadn&#39;t been spotted by him as she had gained her injuries.  He took this moment, though, to take in her bloodied leg.  While still on the idea that the group that had gained his attention moments before was safe, he took in the apprentice&#39;s injuries.  Concern suddenly flashed over his face.  <em><strong><em>&quot;W-what happened?  Are you alright?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked.  If Cloverpaw had been so hurt without him noticing, who else could be?  How injured might Wrenpaw be?  Anxious for his apprentice, he was about to look around for her when the sound of shifting stones met his ears.  

               After he witnessed his nanny&#39;s death, he wished he could have said something in response to Marbledpaw&#39;s conclusive words, preferably around the lines of &quot;no, she can&#39;t be dead,&quot;  Sure, this was a but of a cliche statement, but it would have given himself a little bit of hope to hold onto.  Instead, he already felt that what she said was true.  If Icestar couldn&#39;t survive being crushed like that without losing a life, then it wasn&#39;t likely that Rooksnap could.  His vision began to blur as his eyes watered, wetting his cheeks with more tears than rain.  It seemed as awefuly ironic for the day to suddenly grow so bright when a death as dark as this one was witnessed by so many.  For once, he actually felt resentful for the lack of rain.  Why couldn&#39;t it rain now, instead of raining and causing more unnecessary distress?  A bitter taste grew on his tongue, and for the first time he found himself angry at Starclan.  Why would they let so much distraction happen when they could have stopped it?  Rooksnap would be alive, the camp would be intact, and Fernpaw would be by his side instead of missing.</span>

            The uncharacteristic anger that began to twist his gut faded some as Laurelblaze&#39;s voice met his ears with more directions.  At least she provided him with some guidance when everything was just so... Chaotic.  Chaotic, distressing, stressful, traumatizing, even, and so much more.  Raising a paw to wipe away as many tears from his eyes and fur as he could, he stepped back to allow the others to have enough room to get onto the safety of the Highledge he found himself on.  Only Jayfang seemed to be unwilling to come to the point, at least from what Marigolddust could figure out, and in truth the warrior was the least of his worries, no matter how rude the thought sounded in his own head.</span>

{Sparrowfeather} |   Landslide
(You need to respond to my Skyclan thing, lol)

Sparrowfeather hadn&#39;t even noticed the feather she wore behind her ear was lost in the dirt until she tried to clean herself up a bit. Moving her paw behind her ear and finding it gone. She numbly looked at the clan, in shock and every cat had a look of concern or grief at the camp and their loved ones. Sparrowfeather shook her head. <em>How could this happen?</em> she thought dully. 

She still had a hard time getting up and moving. She felt like her ribs were grinding everytime she got up. But she felt absoloutely dreadful sitting still. She couldn&#39;t stand still...it&#39;s like she still had a bunch of adrenaline pumping through her so she did the best she could. Fetching supplies and bringing cats water. Gritting her teeth the whole time. Her calico pelt was still smudged with dirt like every other cat- there were very few that had mildly clean pelts. 

Sparrowfeather coughed, she still felt the dust and dirt in her throat. Like it was still in her lungs. But she knew that probably wasn&#39;t it. Despite her injury and almost-death. She just couldn&#39;t stand the look of grief on her clanmates faces and went down into the ruins of the camp to help everyone else. Which wasn&#39;t a better choice either- the dens were demolished- soil was everywhere. Practically in layers around the whole camp...the large fallen tree in the middle- dens could be replaced. But this was a whole other thing. She sighed. Moving towards Sandstride. She didn&#39;t say anything. She just bent down and did her best to move with a purpose. Digging at the dirt and trying to see if they could find anything or maybe just clear it out. She saw a near-by pile and started to sweep it out of the entrance. Shivering at the thought that she was under all of this...the whole time...and she still could&#39;ve been if Pinefoot and Sandstride hadn&#39;t found her.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">He could still hear everything, though the camp was quiet. The rumbles of rocks and den walls collapsing, the terrified cries of his Clanmates, names being called out to eachother as felines desperately tried to help their friends and family. Within the flurries of running cats and falling debris, Featherpaw had been frozen in place. He hadn&#39;t been able to find his siblings or his mothers, and fear had completely taken over his entire being. All that the black tabby could remember was pain searing through his leg and shooting up his spine as a rock fell onto him, his attempts at leaping out of the way failing as his back leg was crushed by the boulder. Shards of rock had flown up into his face, and then everything had faded to black.

Groggily, a pair of cerulean eyes flickered open. His head throbbed, and he squinted against the morning sun as it rose over the horizon. The muddy ground had now hardened, and what had splattered over his pelt had crusted. Wincing, he tried to get to his paws, but instantly let out a yelp and fell to the ground as something hindered his attempt. Glancing backward, his gaze widened with horror as he didn&#39;t see his leg, instead a boulder that had buried his limb beneath it. Swallowing roughly, he tried to lean back and push it off, though his back cramped and his attempt was too weak. Letting out a hiss of frustration, his chin fell to the ground with exhaustion, ears flattening against his skull. <em>Mousedung. I&#39;m gonna die here.</em> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

The adrenaline that had been coursing through her veins in the entire duration of the landslide had begun to subside, leaving her feeling exhausted and haggard-looking. Her once russet-toned tortoiseshell pelage was stained with splotches of light brown where dust and mud were clumped up in her thick fur. Her limbs ached from the strain of hauling herself through the mud in order to guide her clanmates to safety, all while dodging debris being sent her way while they were trying to escape the devastation. Laurelblaze sat down and hung her head for a moment, letting out a deep breath as she tried to compose herself. Their camp was utterly destroyed, and they’d lost cats today, it was not a day she’d look back on fondly. After this, they’d have to find their clanmates, dead or alive, and then they’d have to proceed with clearing out the camp. <em>Den arrangements, assessing the damage… The camp looks like a total loss right now.</em> her gaze narrowed a bit out of dismay from the mere sight of it all. Was this some sort of punishment from their ancestors? Or was it something else entirely?

She didn’t want to believe she or the clan did anything to prompt StarClan to send this disaster upon them. They all abided by the Code rather closely after all.

The deputy glanced down towards her leader’s unconscious form for the moment, before murmuring: <strong>”I gotta do something about the others, you’re in good paws here.”</strong> she trusted her clanmates would alert her to her awakening, it was bound to happen sometime or later. But she needed to focus on getting survivors out of the wreckage. <strong>”Anyone not injured by the storm, begin searching for any missing cats! I want no stone left un-turned! Do you understand? Leave not a single cat behind!”</strong> another set of commands was issued and the rescue effort was underway. The deputy began to scale down the rocky steps of the Highledge into the camp below, her jaws parted to see if she could make out any scents of her clanmates caught under the earth. There was a chance some of them were still alive. 

Then she heard a hiss, and her ears flickered. She could spot a pair of familiar cerulean hues, and black-tabby fur. Her breath hitched as she let out a small gasp, her son, he was alive, but trapped. <strong>”Featherpaw!”</strong> she cried out, immediately rushing towards him with a widened gaze. He was sprawled out across the ground, all except for one limb trapped under large rock. <em>It’s got to be crushed under there, that injury may not recover fully when we get him out.</em> she winced at the thought, her son would likely be forced to recover for a long time until his leg was mended, but an injury like this was permanent, and she would know from first-hand experience. <strong>”Featherpaw, I have to get this rock off of your leg… It’s going to hurt a lot, even after its off, but I promise I’m gonna get you out. Okay? Just breathe.”</strong> she was trying to keep him calm, this was not going to be easy, for either of them. Laurelblaze didn’t want to cause him even more pain, but this was the only way to save him, and she’d rather have her son be alive than to let him suffer here. She braced herself as she placed her forepaws upon the rock, getting ready to push. <strong>”Ready? Three… Two… One!”</strong> she grunted as she shifted to put all her weight into pushing the stone off of her son’s limb, growling as she felt it shift against the ground. She wanted to be quick and get this over with so he wouldn’t continue to suffer, but she could feel her efforts weren’t enough, she’d need help. <strong>”I need help here! Featherpaw’s trapped under this stone!”</strong>

Needlestripe held her worried green gaze with his steady golden one. <strong>&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot;</strong> he mumbled, briefly touching her cheek as he stepped past.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;m going to go find them!&quot;</strong> that was the last thing the striped warrior called over his shoulder before leaping back down into the quarry, his silver pelt melting in with the rain. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span>                    </span>

As she watched the tom leap below, she was rather astonished by his bravery. How could she forget about Juniperpaw? Perhaps her greatest responsibility was forgotten in an instant.
<em>No</em> she thought <em>I have to make this right</em>
She sprinted to the cliff side, where she could barely make out Needlestripe below.
<strong>” I’m not letting you go alone!”</strong> she called as she bunched up her haunches to spring

Finally, the mud and wrecked forest matter stopped flowing into the camp, ending the landslide.  Instead, mud dried on the camp and the cats&#39; fur as the clouds dispersed and the sun shone bright.  Although his throat was still tight from the witnessing of Rooksnap&#39;s death and his mind overwhelmingly scattered at everything he had witnessed and felt that day, Laurelblaze&#39;s orders met his ears with ease, her voice being more cutting and attention-catching than the panicky cats around them.  <em>Search for missing cats?</em>  Well, at least he could help now, and maybe he could prevent something like what happened to Rooksnap and Icestar, too... he tried to shake of the distressed emotions he was feeling to no avail.  

             Who could he help?  There were so many in camp, but he couldn&#39;t quite tell if some of them were dead or alive.  He wasn&#39;t strong enough to move stones on his own, so if he were to do a job like that independently he wouldn&#39;t be of much help.  The image of Fernpaw being trapped under rubble flashed across his sight for a moment, and he was just about to try and search for his friend when he heard Laurelblaze&#39;s call yet again.  Confused, he looked over in her direction, only to have his eyes widen at the sight.  Oh Starclan, the sight was gut-twisting.  The warrior wasn&#39;t at all used to seeing injured cats, despite his previous stay at the Fernpaw&#39;s den, and laying his eyes on a cat with their leg crushed under a rock was more than unsettling.  Either way, he forced himself to run over to Laurelblaze&#39;s side, focusing on Featherpaw and his mother.</span>

             <em><strong><em>&quot;I-I&#39;m here to try and help,&quot;</em></strong></em> he spoke softly, stuttering as he was again distracted by the situation.  When Laurelblaze began to work on moving the stone again, he pushed his own side against the rocky surface in hopes of helping them push the boulder off of Featherpaw&#39;s leg.  He couldn&#39;t even imagine the pain the apprentice must have been doing through, and he didn&#39;t care to try to, otherwise it might make him cringe and mess up their rescue attempt.

(I did)

Pinefoot had to sit down for a rest now, folding his paws, breathing in heavily- his chest felt tight, and the world felt heavy, and he wasn&#39;t sure what to do. How much dust got into his nose? How much dirt, and grass, and whatever else was kicked up by the landslide and the panic?

They had lost the camp for a while, he knew that. It would be a lot of work coming, and he had a feeling that most cats... most cats would be too busy mourning. Where even were the cats he knew? The medicine cat, who should have been treating people? Keenstreak, his old enemy who he doubted was even in camp at the time? He knew Sparrowfeather and Sandstride were fine, and he didn&#39;t often think about the crow&#39;s safety- it was a bird, and they were better at living than he thought. Just look at all the times he had failed to catch one!

&quot;Well,&quot; he said to nobody in particular, &quot;this is a mess.&quot; He would wait for instructions before he tried to clean out any dens, and besides, he was exhausted after the rescuing. He hoped the leader would understand that. He heard cats calling- some Clanmates were missing, others were hurt- but there wasn&#39;t much he could do in this state.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Pointy ears twitched as he could hear chattering within the distance. At this point, he wasn&#39;t too sure if it was his mind playing tricks on him, or if his Clan was still nearby. He gazed out helplessly ahead of him, in that moment, thinking of nothing but his siblings. Viperpaw, specifically. He had equal love for all of his littermates, though him and the she-cat held a bond slightly closer than the others, in his eyes. Besides, he had made a promise - if she were to leave the Clan after all, he&#39;d take care of Fox and Tiger, if they wanted to stay. <em>If I die here, I break that promise,</em> he thought sadly, wincing at the thought. The wince caused his face to sting, in which he let out another hiss. Three large gouges sat across his face, only barely missing his eyes. It seemed that if StarClan was real, they had spared him his sight - it was the least they could do, after crushing his leg.

It wasn&#39;t long before movement in the far distance caught his eye, and weakly, he lifted his head. Squinting, he could have sworn that those were the pelt hues of his mother.. <em>&quot;Featherpaw!&quot;</em> The apprentice could have almost cried with relief as he heard the familiar voice being called out to him, tears stinging at his gaze. And though his whole time knowing the she-cat he had called her Laurelblaze, a new name escaped his lips. <strong>&quot;Mom!&quot;</strong>

As the deputy rushed over and began to speak reassuring words, his ears flattened once more and he nodded. He chewed on his lips nervously, the pain was bad enough as it was, surely it couldn&#39;t get worse than this? Though, as the countdown lead to nothing but the rock shifting over his leg slightly, another yelp of pain escaped his lips and his claws sunk into the hardened mud below. <strong>&quot;Mousedung! StarClan, that hurts!&quot;</strong> He cried out, a string of curses following that he&#39;d never usually dare use infront of his mother. He was sure, though, that with his current state, she&#39;d let it slide. As she called out for help, Featherpaw let out a small whimper. <strong>&quot;I-I&#39;m gonna be okay, right?&quot;</strong>

As another feline, Marigolddust, bounded over to assist, his ears flattened and he looked away. He could feel the boulder shifting, and every movement sent pain shooting up his spine. Droplets of blood formed around his fangs as he bit into his lip, trying to hold back the cries of agony. He didn&#39;t want to worry the duo too much - they were saving his life, after all. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

Her heart lurched when she heard the muffled cries escaping from her son when she was shifting the boulder off of him with Marigolddust’s aid. She’d be forever thankful for the tuxedo tom’s help, but right now her son needed to get out of this. <strong>”I’m so sorry sweetheart I know it hurts, you can cry, its okay, I know this is painful.”</strong> she didn’t want her children bottling up their feelings, not like she had in the past. Especially in the case of if they’re injured badly and need to let it out while they’re being rescued, how Featherpaw was trying <em>not</em> to cry in front of her was mind-boggling. <strong>”Once we get you out of here we’ll get you looked at, you’ll be okay, I’ll make sure of it.”</strong> the deputy was <em>praying</em> her son’s injuries weren’t fatal. Even if they weren’t dealt to vital organs or arteries, these sort of injuries could be deadly if not treated quickly, and she wanted her kit <em>alive</em>.  

She growled as she used her remaining stamina to do one last push against the boulder’s surface, her eyes burning with hatred towards the inanimate object. It was the source of her child’s pain, and she was removing it like she was cutting down an enemy. She felt it roll backward, and her stomach churned at the sight of blood staining it’s surface, before she saw her son’s mangled leg. <em>Oh StarClan… I don’t even know if this can even be mended, this is bad.</em> she blinked at the sight, before she gazed back towards her son, giving his forehead a quick lick. He was freed, but she needed to get him to safety. <strong>”Thank you, Marigolddust. Truly, he wouldn’t be out of this mess if not for you.”</strong> her gaze softened as she graciously thanked her clanmate and friend, slight tears beginning to form around her eyes. She needed to go and get Featherpaw help, he couldn’t stay like this. <strong>”I gotta haul him up to the Highledge…”</strong>

It was an understatement to say that Marigolddust was surprised Featherpaw wasn&#39;t verbalizing much of his pain when he arrived.  If he was in the apprentice&#39;s position, he probably would have been crying at least a little bit, no matter how pathetic the thought was.  Bracing himself, he continued to use as much strength as he could to assist Laurelblaze with getting the large stone off of her son&#39;s leg.  He himself winced at the small, yet impactful noises from black tabby as he and Laurelblaze continued to work at moving the stone.  He hardly knew the younger tom, other than the fact that he had been adopted along with his siblings by Laurel and Holly, but any sound of pain like this could likely get to any cat if they had a heart.  Fortunately, the two managed to get the small boulder off of Featherpaw, despite how terrible of a sight came as a result.  Marigolddust cringed when he finally caught sight of the injury, suddenly feeling sick.  Could it even be healed?  It looked so terrible, and he knew that Fernpaw had a big job coming once they could figure things out.  Maybe he could try and help, despite how hesitant he was to even look at it.  

               Meeting Laurelblaze&#39;s odd gaze, he gave her a bit of a weak smile.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Thank you, although I probably just happened to end up here before anyone else could,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, turning his attention again to the taste of not looking too hard at Featherpaw&#39;s injuries.  He wasn&#39;t sure when they would be able to find medical help for Featherpaw in the midst of this mess, but he had an idea on how to make it faster.  Perhaps he wanted to do this for himself, too.  <em><strong><em>*If you don&#39;t need help, i&#39;ll go try and find Fernpaw for you if she&#39;s in camp,&quot;</em></strong></em> he offered.</span>

             Maybe he could search for her, and then while he was searching he could help anybody he could find.  Yes, that sounded like an alright plan, although he doubted he could help a cat under a large stone like Featherpaw alone.

As she watched the tom leap below, she was rather astonished by his bravery. How could she forget about Juniperpaw? Perhaps her greatest responsibility was forgotten in an instant.
<em>No</em> she thought <em>I have to make this right</em>
She sprinted to the cliff side, where she could barely make out Needlestripe below.
<strong>” I’m not letting you go alone!”</strong> she called as she bunched up her haunches to spring

The landslide was still fresh in her mind. Although most cats were safe, she knew that there were some missing. Among them was Juniperpaw, her apprentice. She looked down in the camp in worry.
She was conflicted.
Strange dreams had ravaged her. Dreams where she was promised everything she had ever wanted. It was only a matter on if she chose to act on them.
She flexed her claws, and bowed her head as thoughts flashed through her mind.

The tom-cat shook his filthy pelt out a bit, an evident nasty scowl practically sutured on his face as he stalked around the disheveled campgrounds. His large paws tried their best to side step any of the few rocks that littered his path, blinking his beaming yellow eyes as they focused in on Wolfshine. 
His tail immediately shot up, narrowing his hues slightly as he nonchalantly made his way over, head tilting as he observed her worried state. <strong>”What’s on your mind, Wolfshine?”</strong> he asked the molly with a curious tone, eyebrow raising slightly. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

The she-cat turned to see Frozenmink and his curious expression. The fur on her back bristled slightly.
<em>Did he know?</em>
She relaxed, hoping he wouldn’t sense her anxiety. She couldn’t be jumping every time some cat came up to her. The white pelted she-cat swished her tail lightly, trying to act as calm as possible. She might have seen him in her recent dreams, she just wasn’t sure. 
Every night Wolfshine knew that these things weren’t happening in her head. They were real. And Frozenmink might know.
<strong>” Oh it’s- uh nothing. Just a little tired- you know I haven’t been getting any sleep”</strong>
She glanced at him, and narrowed her eyes.

The grey-pelted cat watched as she lifted her green eyes to greet him, smirking a tad at the sight of him. So, she <em>had</em> been worried. The expression was practically pooling from her eyes, Frozenmink pricking his sharp ears as the pale green orbs narrowed. <em>Haven’t been getting much sleep..</em>
<strong>”Listen.”</strong> he started in a lowered voice, expression not changing as his tone did. <strong>”You don’t have to put up a front around me. I <em>know</em>.”</strong> he meowed to the older warrior with a grin, raising a paw to swiftly lap at it. <strong>”You’ll get used to the tiredness after a while.”</strong> Frozenmink added with a sly swing of his whiskers. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

Needlestripe approached them from behind, teeth showing through a yawn, and mud dusted paws sending pebbles showering down into the cracks of fallen boulders. His golden jeweled expression remained kind, and unassuming. Only surprise flashed when he saw Wolfshine. He hadn&#39;t expected her to follow him back into the landslide; at least she was okay. <em>Now we&#39;re all stuck here.</em>

<strong>&quot;Know what?&quot;</strong> he aimed at Frozenmink instead, suspicion edging his meow, eyes narrowing slightly. <span class="mention" title="vamp#2964">@zeph :3</span> <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

He bristled his fur slightly as the new feline stepped up, immediately recognizing his clan mate with a pointed stare. Snorting, the cat twitched his thick tail-tip and gave a toothy grin, raising his large paw to swipe over his left ear. <strong>”Know that you’re a nosy little kit.”</strong> he sneered in amusement, yellow hues returning back to Wolfshine’s face. The tom wasn’t too happy about the suspicious tone in the other male’s voice, deciding not to show it as he kept up the cheeky smirk. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span> <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

 Frozenmink’s comment sent a shudder through her. So he was a part of it after all. That meant she wasn’t the only one.
The younger warrior seemed almost too relaxed about it. She felt uneasy, but also concerned for her clanmate. He seemed to be following Silentwing without much hesitation.
Before she could speak, Needlestripe entered from behind. Her green eyes blinked warmly at the Tom. Frozenmink’s comment reminded her of the severity of the situation. There was no way that Needlestripe could be a part of this.
<em>Right?</em>
She would have to end the conversation with Frozenmink before Needle suspected. 
<strong>” Oh, we weren’t talking about much”</strong> she quickly interjected.
<strong>” Needlestripe, how are you doing?”</strong> she asked, trying to change the subject.

He kept his eery silence as Wolfshine spoke to the warrior, his pupils dashing between the two with a curious look. Finally, he looked away boredly, growing disinterested in the pair as he wondered what he would eat today. Probably nothing.. the fresh kill pile was dwindling by the minutes. 
<strong>”Whoop-dee-doo”</strong> he managed to murmur in sarcasm, tail tip twitching in irritation as he peered around the trapped camp. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span> <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

Wolfshine froze as the warrior nuzzled her.
<em>He’s with them too?</em>
<strong>” You- you know?”</strong> part of her was shocked, but also afraid as well. He didn’t seem to be hesitant like Wolfshine was. Was she really wrong to be so afraid?
She finally gave in, and nuzzled him back. This is what Silentwing promised! A family at last. She was getting her wish.
<strong>” I’m glad that we’re in this together”</strong> she said to the silver Tom. However, her green eyes still flashed with worry. There was still doubt, however small, inside of her.
She shot a glance to Frozenmink, seeing his obvious distraction.
<strong>” I know we’re supposed to be destroying this place.”</strong> she directed to Frozenmink, <strong>” It’s hard for me to do damage here. Maybe we can just loosen a few rocks?”</strong> she hoped the both of them would agree, but deep down she knew they wouldn’t.

My belly thinks my throat&#39;s been torn out.&quot;</strong> Whether he meant the apprentices that&#39;d been assigned to bring supplies or their fellow turncoats who might steal prey was unclear. The fresh kill pile was at least a couple tail lengths below them, buried in rubble, and likely spoiled by mud. It&#39;d be a couple days before any prey returned to the forest, so they&#39;d just have to wait. The striped tom went on, <strong>&quot;In the meantime let&#39;s just do our best.

His disinterest grew again as the white molly began speaking again, wondering how the clan was going to thrive after this disaster. He knew rescue missions and hunting patrols were being put in place but.. how much trust could you really put in a bunch of stupid apprentices? 
Humming softly, he twitched his ears at their words and nodded thoughtfully, taking a critical view around camp. <strong>”That’s actually not a terrible plan.”</strong> he meowed with a small smile, standing up to stretch. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span> <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

Destruction. Utter, complete destruction. Such had been what had plauged Thunderclan as of late, but truly the landslide had to be the worst of all. The mere urge to survive had been great - but the sounds of her clanmates crying out in terror had probably been the worst of it all - not to mention, witness various other horrific events. Even so, her ears no longer rang from their cries, the rain, thunder nor trembling of the ground. It was over...and thus no longer needed to harbor within her mind.
    The tabby slowly made her way through the destroyed camp, her violet gaze flickering about momentarily over those held captive within it alongside her. The feline allowed a breath to escape from her, whiskers quivering as she slowly allowed herself to be settled among the ground. How boring this all was. She could hardly keep her head on straight with the lack of activities one could accomplish - it felt like being trapped among a den with no way out. surely, she&#39;d find something of interest soon enough. But for now...she&#39;d wait.

The prone body lay on the Highledge, breathless and silent. Icestar’s damaged body was shaped awkwardly but the gruesome concept was censored by the smearing of brown and gray over her light-coloured fur. Fortunately, this predicament she had was only temporary. Being granted nine lives had its perks and this was one of them. Even more fortunate was that she only needed to use up one life to revive herself.

Just as it had occurred quite a few times before, her body slowly began to heal. The strange angles of her neck and limbs straightened again. Her sprained ankle recovered. Splintered ribs reconnected into one. Then her first breath came: a shallow, ragged inhale of air. Pain strung at her nerves but that was a good sign. It brought her back into consciousness. By the time Icestar’s eyes flew open, she was fully healed and very much alive.</span>

The tips of the half clans cats ears curled ears were so flat against her plush head they almost appeared nonexistent- giving her head the roundness of an owl.The spotted faes bright green ivy hued eyes dashed around the destroyed camp- her heart blistered with the pain of wondering- how many lives were lost- who was injured, how would they clean this mess up… if they could. 

She was much like her father in that aspect- the continued observation and empathy, Panicflare had been a slave to empathy.  The black and white spotted cat spoke to the nearest cat to her, it was a cat who bore a violet gaze. The shecat wasn’t one for small talk- she would rather sit in ants than discuss give in to idle chatter. She just needed to hear something- really anything, a distraction. 

The most simple but genuine words were spoken to her clan mate, <strong>”You good?”</strong> of course no one who had ears was good in this moment. Not with the horrors that had been painted into their eardrums by the pain and suffering around them. This question was physical, was this cat harmed. <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span></span>

The tabby wouldn&#39;t have to wait much longer before another arrived to distract her from her thoughts. Truly, the warrior hardly ever talked to another - not due to shyness nor anxiety, but such an action became emotionally draining after some time. And right now, she was probably the most drained she&#39;d ever been in quite some time. Of course...she&#39;d never admit to such a thing.
    A spotted molly approached her, green gaze harboring that of a concerned light. Her whiskers quivered as she inspected the feline before her, clearly overwhelmed by recent events just as everyone else seemed to be. She allowed for her body to relax slightly, inhaling before she spoke. <strong>&quot;Quite. if anything, I merely have a few scratches to worry about here and there. My mind however...another story.&quot;</strong>

With a flick of her tail and a moment of silence, the tabby continued. <strong>&quot;You on the other paw...look unwell. Though, I assume not due to mere injury.&quot;</strong> she swept her tail around her paws, tilting her head slightly.

Speckledivy was a young an inexperienced warrior, just 13 moons old. <strong>” I think we’re all mentally in shambles as of right now.”</strong> the she cat responded, coiling her own spotted tail around her sore, bruised paws. She had heard about some of the events that a can could face, from floods to wild fires, and even falling rocks. She hadn’t taken into account the severity of it. They just felt like stories to her.  
<strong>” I suppose so long as i have four working paws I should be grateful and put them to work.”</strong> there was a soft sense of determination floating around the spotted feline. As if she was more than willing to try and make the best of the situation-even if she had no idea where to start. 
The she cat looked over the camp, it was hardly recognizable- it felt like a disastrous prison. She wasn’t even sure where it was safe to step… <strong>”On second though- I’ll wait for orders…”</strong> she let put a soft sigh.  <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span></span>

Were they? The tabby didn&#39;t respond right away, merely tossing the idea about in her mind. Could she truly say she was in...shambles? <em>I do not harbor the same blood...Surely, I cannot be the same in such a manner?</em> True...to an extent, anyway.
    No, Hollowgrove would never feel the same connection to Thunderclan as her fellow, clan-blood companions did. She didn&#39;t grow up among them nor witnessed the same things. She&#39;d arrived at what would&#39;ve been considered as older apprentice, late within apprenticeship. And even so, she had never felt truly at home among them...merely those she interacted with, worked alongside and aided in protecting them. Truly, she didn&#39;t feel a deep connection with them...and that feeling sat oddly within her, such a thought was undescribable. In a good or bad way? Simply, unknown.
    As the younger feline continued, Hollowgrove merely allowed for a brief hum, as if weighing her options concerning a response. <strong>&quot;Such would be for the best. The last thing we&#39;d need would be for someone to make matters worse.&quot;</strong> she replied, ears flicking. The clan wouldn&#39;t need any further drama for quite some time.

<em><strong><em>•Near Future•</em></strong></em>

It was a day after he had been appointed the new medicine cat of Thunderclan, and he was beginning to discover the surface of his new difficulties.  He was in charge of a whole den now, by himself for that matter, and said den was absolutely destroyed.  Once they had finally dug their way through the enterance so they could temporarily enter, it seemed like all of the herbs had been destroyed.  It seemed a bit stranger that no herbs remained, but it was hard to think further on it when he was so stressed about how he would be able to access what he needed to help all of the injured.  Could he even help the injured?  He only knew the basics, and it made him sick to his stomach whenever he thought of Featherpaw&#39;s wound.  He would have to <em>fix that</em>.  He&#39;d have to heal Cloverpaw and the others, too.  He tried to push down his growing nerves, instead focusing on the camp around him.  Everything was destroyed, and they&#39;d all figure it out... Eventually.  It was only his first day with this new rank... Not much could be expected of him, right?  Raising his paw, he used it to scoop away yet another paw full of muddy dirt from the camp&#39;s wall.  It was a lot to work on, but if he planned on being of any use now that he was in Fernpaw&#39;s place he would have to be able to get out of camp... Even if he was making little to no progress besides the others of the clan.  

              Taking a step back, he examined his progress.  Doubt filled his gaze as he took in how little work he had really done.  This landslide was making things so difficult!  Sighing, he raised a paw and gave it a few licks, hoping to clean some of the mud out from under his claws.  It was difficult, but provided him with a break.</span>

           There was little more that he could do besides try and help with the covered enterances, at least those who could fit a warrior.  He couldn&#39;t hunt, he couldn&#39;t try and practice his new role in the clan, and he couldn&#39;t really train with all of the debris that had to be moved.  What if they starved here?  The apprentices were doing well, but their work might not be enough to feed a whole clan.  He could feel his own hunger itching for him to eat larger meals than the few mice or a rabbit, but he often ignored it unless it was actually time for him to eat.  Now, he sat there quietly debating what to do as he tried to rid the muddy taste from his mouth.

Dustycloud looked to Hollyfrost and then the wood, apparently contemplating his choices before finally taking the leap onto the wood, landing quietly. He may not have the brute strength or the cliche bravery of a Thunderclan warrior, but if he had one good quality it was his agility. On second thought, there were times he was clumsier than a bird with one wing. 
It was ironic, how the older and more seasoned of the pair was somehow more young at heart than the relatively fresh warrior. At the mention of Featherpelt he couldnt help but brush off most of his complaints. <strong>&quot;He wouldve been sensible enough to wait until after... whatever in the dark forest is out at this time of night.&quot;</strong> He countered, gesturing abstractly with his paw towards the darkness that awaited them.
By no means was he in love with the idea of venturing out into the night, but at the end of the day anyone knew Dustycloud was a loyal follower. He&#39;d conquer all his fears at once if it meant journeying to find one cat he was faithful to. Besides, sneaking up on a bird in the dark would be something new to try. <strong>&quot;If I break a leg Im telling Marigolddust that you dragged me out here against my will.&quot;</strong> He mewed, anxiety creeping up on him the closer he made his way to the end of the log. <span class="mention" title="✧*̥˚ snips *̥˚✧#1759">@fuzz</span></span>

There were some mothers that mistaken you for your much stronger - fleecer - fluffier - mellificent mother. Hollyfrost.

Tigerpaw jerked awake at the sudden touch of the black felines paws upon her ginger and white pelt, shooting her green eyes over her curled sleeping figure. She stared her foster mother— Droolingly furrowed as her tired eyes slowly blinked, really confused until she realized . . .

<strong>&quot;M— Mom-!&quot;</strong>  Tigerpaw whisper-yelled to the bigger molly, trying her best to keep herself hushed from waking up the other cats in the brambled den. &#39;<em>Can&#39;t I get myself some space—?</em>&#39;  <strong>&quot;Holly mom,, Holly mom—&quot;</strong>  Tigerpaw continued with her hushed voice, reaching her dark paw over and nudging Hollyfrost gently on the head, hoping to solve the situation quickly by waking her mom up.  <strong>&quot; m o o o o m — &quot;</strong></span>

The way the golden sun lit up the land made it hard to believe that not long ago the forest had been ravaged by terrible rains and a landslide which had all but destroyed the ThunderClan camp. Despite the positive change in weather, prey still remained quite scarce, and as Wrenpaw wriggled through a tiny gap in the barrier she only carried two small mice in her jaws. Not much to show for her hunting trip, but she supposed it was better than nothing at all. Her tail dropped behind her, dragging through the mud as she made her way towards the pathetic excuse for a fresh-kill pile to deposit her mice. Normally as an apprentice, the opportunity to leave the camp and hunt without an escort would have been a very exciting thing since apprentices weren’t allowed out alone. However, the circumstances had sucked all of the fun out of it, and a melancholy look was evident on the caramel fem’s features as she made her way towards where the apprentices den used to be. 

She sat down outside the skeleton of the den, her stomach rumbling as she did so. She couldn’t deny the fact that she was hungry, but she wasn’t going to eat until there was more prey on the pile. The warriors were working tirelessly to rebuild the camp and create an entrance large enough for them to come and go, and they would need every bit of prey they could get to keep up their strength. The first two moons of her apprenticeship had been so wonderful, it was hard to believe this is what it had come to. Wrenpaw never could have expected to face such hardships at such a young age, but perhaps in the end it would only make her stronger. 

As her amber gaze swept across the ruins of her home,</span>

Perhaps she was being overly anxious, but typically when she was worried about something there was a good reason for it.

A small hole shifted in the wall of mud near the camp entrance, sending rubble cascading about. A dark tabby head poked through, coated in dust and mud. The toms deep amber eyes were alight with amusement despite the situation, a small smile upon his face, until his gaze snagged upon Wrenpaw.&#160;

Adderpaw trotted over to the she-cat, his tail held high. He shook out his fur, sending dirt and mud showering around him like rain in a storm.&#160;

&quot;Hey Wrenpaw!&quot; He chirped, plopping down near the other apprentice.

He was still a new apprentice, and although he wouldn&#39;t admit it, he was desperate to make friends. He wanted others to like him. Maybe Wrenpaw could be a new friend? Hopefully she wouldn&#39;t find him annoying.

Despite her dull mood, a bright smile appeared on her lips as Adderpaw approached her. The company of others always cheered her up, no matter how she was feeling, and provided a great distraction from her wandering thoughts. Besides, she had never really spoken to Adderpaw before and it would be nice to get the opportunity to know him better. Wrenpaw was always open to making new friends. <strong>”Oh, hey Adderpaw,”</strong> she returned his greeting, a small laugh following as he shook the debris from his pelt. Her own fur was streaked with mud and tainted with dust, and she wondered if any of them would ever be clean again. 

<strong>”You look well. Or, as well as any of us can right now,”</strong> she added. She was glad to see that her fellow apprentice seemed to be in good spirits, though she had to admit it was hard to understand how he managed that. Wrenpaw always saw the bright side of things for the most part, but the recent events had caused a significant rift in her enthusiasm. Surely talking to Adderpaw would help, but it was hard to forget about her worries entirely. <span class="mention" title="Ginger#8317">@Ginger</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tigerpaw raced up to the edge of the broken ThunderClan camp. <strong>&quot;Laurelblaze!&quot;</strong> she cried, pink eyes searching wildly for the large torbie figure. Stones and dirt crumbled where she stood and she stepped back. Fear edged her voice as she yelled out again, but she knew this was the first cat she had to see.

<strong>&quot;Laurelblaze! Are you down there?&quot;</strong> The apprentice&#39;s desperate call echoed down into the camp. Cats all around her were busy digging, gathering, repairing.

For the past few days she&#39;d been missing with Juniperpaw without notice. But she couldn&#39;t even think about explaining herself before making sure her mentor was okay. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

The dust had settled at last, and she’d begun ordering whatever able-bodied cats she had in camp to begin unearthing the debris around camp. She had been working at the obstacles herself as well, considering she was able to as she was relatively unscathed from the landslide. She’d be using her strength for the greater good of camp, and to honor the cats who were lost in the landslide… Though some cats had mysteriously disappeared <em>after</em> the event. Her apprentice, Tigerpaw, had been accounted for when the landslide ended, but all of a sudden, the next morning she had disappeared along with another apprentice, Juniperpaw. The deputy was worried sick over her, especially since the mysterious deaths that had also occurred prior to the landslide, she didn’t want Tigerpaw out there with only another apprentice at her side…

Yet, almost conveniently, before she could organize a search, Tigerpaw was here, calling out to her from above the quarry. She was alive.

Laurelblaze had been digging into a wall of dirt that was blocking the entrance, attempting to dislodge a boulder that was blocking more earth. Her fur was stained light brown, and was visibly messy— but when she heard her apprentice’s voice, it visibly bristled, and her pupils narrowed to slits from shock. Her head shot up for a moment, and she couldn’t believe her eyes, Tigerpaw was alive, and <em>well.</em>

<em>Just what was the meaning of this, disappearing without a word?!</em>

Her better judgement was being trumped by her instinctual fury of her apprentice’s late return, it was as if her own kits missed a curfew by <em>hours</em>, except this was <em>days!</em> Tigerpaw could have died!

<strong>”You have ten seconds to get your sorry little behind down here NOW.”</strong> 

Needless to say, Tigerpaw should be <em>very</em> afraid.

She instantly sprang into action, scrambling through the nearest narrow entrance into camp and skidding down the rocks to where Laurelblaze stood on an outcove ledge. Small smudges of blood were left where she set her paws, their pads cracked and bleeding from hasty travel back home. Her striped brown fur was bushed and her eyes wide but her lips remained glued shut. She braced herself for the storm that was inevitably to come. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

“Furious” couldn’t even describe her emotions at this moment, “Livid” was a better descriptor. She was nearly shaking from rage, how <em>dare</em> her own apprentice decide to go galavanting across the forest without a single indication she was okay? That she was <em>alive?</em> Laurelblaze couldn’t believe the audacity of it all! She felt her teeth clench as she forced herself to keep her claws sheathed, as much as she wanted to rip her claws through the earth she’d been working at for hours now. <em>That</em> was how angry she was, and Tigerpaw was about to learn her lesson.

<strong>”You think you can just go running off without any word, not even telling us where you were going, and expect to come back here without anyone being upset?”</strong> she bore her fangs as she spoke, disappointment in her apprentice’s actions <em>very</em> evident in her voice. <strong>”I was worried, do you even understand how dangerous it is out there by yourself? Did you forget what we JUST found on the northern border not even a moon ago? Is there a beehive where your brain should be? An empty space inside your skull? What the hell were you thinking?”</strong> she was laying into the young tabby, giving her a lecture not much unlike those of a parent giving to their misbehaved child. Laurelblaze was pacing now, shaking her head and muttering in between her sentences, her tail wildly lashing around behind her. All of a sudden, she stopped, and she stared down the younger she-cat with death in her gaze. <strong>”You don’t even understand how much trouble you’re in. This was reckless and stupid, and I’m not going to let you forget anytime soon.”</strong>

The young she-cat already felt guilty, and Laurelblaze&#39;s words only amplified this. On top of that she had broken up with Juniperpaw. She had expected this. <em>I deserve it.</em> After a few moments her whole body began to shake.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;</strong> she choked quietly at first, then burst into full on tears. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Laurelblaze! I&#39;m so sorry-&quot;</strong> Sobs stole her voice away. Tigerpaw collapsed where she stood, outstretched arms reaching desperately for even one of her mentor&#39;s grizzly ones. <strong>&quot;I got sick. We don&#39;t have a medicine cat, so... I left. Juniperpaw only came to protect me.&quot;</strong> This was a lie, but she wasn&#39;t about to tarnish his reputation too. <strong>&quot;But I&#39;m back now, and I&#39;m better, and I won&#39;t ever do it again.

<strong>”You could have gotten killed.”</strong> she lowly growled, her gaze still burning, though clearly simmering down a bit from the initial blaze. Tigerpaw had done something that could have cost her not only her life, but the life of Juniperpaw as well. They’d both have to face the consequences of their actions, and Laurelblaze planned to show them the error of their ways. They’d need to work their tails off in order to make up for the days lost from their little trip outside of the territory. This was not to be rewarded or made light of. This was practically <em>desertion</em> of the clan in one of the greatest disasters they’d faced in quite some time.

<strong>”Sick or not, you should have stayed here, we could have cared for you where you would have been safe. You not only put yourself in danger, but Juniperpaw as well. I expected both of you to know better than that.”</strong> her gaze narrowed, and she let out a small “tsk” sound. <em>Clearly we need to spend more time going over the Code. I can’t believe she’d just run off and do something like this!</em> she frowned, letting out a small sigh as she glanced back towards Tigerpaw with another shake of her head. The tortoiseshell didn’t want to make her cry, but this was serious, she had to stress to her just how bad this was, she was lucky she wouldn’t be exiled for something like this. She couldn’t do this again! <strong>”Don’t you ever do something like this again, tell us next time you decide to go. I was worried about you!”</strong> her tone shifted to one more akin to concern, her fury had seemed to cool off for now. Laurelblaze had lost an apprentice before, out of her control, but she refused to allow it to happen again. She deserved a life ahead of her in warriorhood, she wanted her to make it that far. But Tigerpaw doing something like this jeopardized that, she played with her life!

<em>I made a promise I’d keep my apprentices safe. I need to uphold it.</em>

At the mention of Juniperpaw&#39;s safety, Tigerpaw&#39;s tears dried and she stared at something beyond Laurelblaze, unblinking. <em>She&#39;s right.</em> Even if they weren&#39;t together anymore, she was glad she hadn&#39;t lost him in that way. It would&#39;ve been a whole other kind of heartbreak.

Oh how the mighty had fallen. With each passing day, hope seemed to shrivel continuously, a sense of uncertainty settling over the more or less trapped clan, leaving their last traces of optimism among those deemed apprentices. They were their only hope and if they failed...then surely, the clan would perish and Thunderclan would be no more. A legend lost upon the realms of time, an unfortunate and perhaps, unworthy fate for them. But alas...such was seeming to become quite possible, a destiny that no one wished for and yet, could very well receive. How unfortunate, indeed.
    The skies were overcast, dark and gloomy as if even the heavens above were mourning. No rain had fallen, which was fortunate concerning they had no dens to flee to if such an event were to happen. There was enough to worry about currently. The lack of prey, which left various felines hungry, thus heavily low on energy, their strength steadily weakening. Even more so for the injured, whom had received no treatment as of yet. The medicine den had been blocked just as the rest of the dens. And along with that, their medicine cat had more or less gone missing among previous events...perhaps falling to the same fate as Icestar. If not...where exactly had she gone?</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As the tabby&#39;s violet gaze hovered over the destroyed camp once more, she began to feel overly large among the ruins, a heavy breath escaping her. She&#39;d never felt so...trapped before. Perhaps it was the outsider rising within her or suddenly bound in anxiety, but whatever the case, she was about to escape it. Rising to her paws, Hollowgrove strode rather quickly away from her resting spot, eyes searching for anything she could busy herself with for the time being. Many seemed just as upset as she felt or were occupied with some sort of interaction or past. Finally, her gaze landed on a particular feline who seemed to be by himself and questioning what to do. She&#39;d never been overly social...but perhaps, she could aid him in whatever task he&#39;d paused from doing.

Padding over to the bi-colored tom, her tail waved once in a supposedly friendly manner, forcing a generally neutral expression upon her face. She cleared her throat once reaching the young warrior, sparing a moment of silence to gather her thoughts. <strong>&quot;Marigolddust.&quot;</strong> she greeted in a voice that was neither friendly nor unkind. She glanced at his work, letting her gaze rest upon it for a moment or so, before returning it to the tom. <strong>&quot;Helping out? Would you by chance, consider the aid of another?&quot;</strong> she offered, before unsheathing her claws and taking a few swipes at the dirt, not even waiting for a proper response. After a moment, she glanced over her shoulder. <strong>&quot;Forgive me, you simply seem...unwell. Though not in the manner of being ill. Fearful, perhaps. Or tied up in stress. Various things it could be...many feel such a way, these days.&quot;</strong> she finished, before returning her attention to the dirt covered wall before her.

This incident could have been very costly for the clan if Tigerpaw and Juniperpaw hadn’t returned alive, she couldn’t be lenient with her even if she was her apprentice. Laurelblaze shook her head, and spoke up once again: <strong>”You better be, because I need you to help out with camp. We’re not training until I say we can, instead we’re both going to be working together on clearing out camp. Understand?”</strong> a fitting punishment, Tigerpaw had been missing for a few days, so she’d make her miss that many days while she worked in camp and helped the others. It wasn’t as if she was going to be sitting there doing nothing, she’d be working. It was almost like if she were given nest duty for the elders and tasked to remove their ticks off of them with mouse bile. Instead, Tigerpaw would be helping her excavate the various debris blocking the camp entrances, and it would be much more productive. She’d be able to keep her eye on her apprentice this way, and it wouldn’t be forever.

<strong>”Now, get some prey and eat if you’re hungry. I need to clear up this tunnel so I can send out actual patrols again so we don’t starve to death in here.”</strong> she flicked her tail in the direction of the rather pitiful fresh-kill pile, before she approached the wall of dirt she’d been clawing at before her encounter with her apprentice. This wasn’t going anywhere unless they did get to work. <em>I can’t send out border patrols with only apprentices and not enough warriors, we can’t lose territory now!</em>

&quot;I think this is a great new look,&quot; Adderpaw meowed, &quot;it&#39;s an improvement for some of the warriors.&quot;&#160;

He snickered quietly, glancing at Wrenpaw with amber eyes glowing brightly. He knew this was a serious situation, that rebuilding would take a lot of time and effort, but things might be just a little bit easier if they joked around a bit. Try to stay positive.&#160;

The tabby hummed softly, his tail flicking. It was nice to feel the sun warm on his back. After a long day of digging, his muscles were stiff and tired. He rolled over onto his side, stretching out so that the remaining rays of light were soaking into the stripes on his flank.

The molly lifted an alabaster paw and cupped it softly to her mouth, giggling at his words. <strong>”Oh, geez,”</strong> she said between laughs. <strong>”I think you might be right,”</strong> she added in a slightly hushed voice, honey colored gaze drifting around the camp. She had to admire how strong her clanmates looked despite the hardships they were currently facing. They were working hard to repair the camp, and though the progress was slow it was still noticeably coming along. Wrenpaw was feeling much better now that she was talking to Adderpaw, and she was glad the tom had come along to cheer her up. It was refreshing to talk to someone with a positive attitude in the midst of all the gloominess. 

<strong>”The sun feels nice, doesn’t it? I’m so glad the rain is gone,”</strong> the caramel apprentice said with a smile. She was tired and sore as well from repair efforts and hunting multiple times a day, but still, lounging about was beginning to make her feel guilty. Then again, everyone needed their rest, right? If she was too tired she wouldn’t be able to help the clan very effectively at all. <strong>”Hey, would you wanna go on a hunt in a bit? I went once already but… I didn’t catch that much,”</strong> Wrenpaw said with a little shrug. <span class="mention" title="Ginger#8317">@Ginger</span></span>

Her guilt pulled her to immediately go help Laurelblaze, but after rushing to get back home and spending the day hunting, her paws hurt more than they ever had. Blood smeared where she walked. Spotting a small puddle among the rubble, Tigerpaw ventured to it eagerly and stuck her paws in, hoping it would cool their cuts.

It stung instead. <strong>&quot;Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow-&quot;</strong> Tigerpaw drew in a sharp breath of pain and leaped backwards, examining the bloody pads pitifully now. <em>My whole body aches...

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Tigerpaw&#39;s absence had been yet another that joined the large pool of lives lost, in any way that could be considered.  Although there was no doubt that Marigolddust had worried about Tigerpaw, he wasn&#39;t quite as stricken or angered as Laurelblaze had been when he finally set eyes on the dark raspberry chocolate apprentice.  His attention was first caught when he had heard the pained wimpering coming from the direction of the prey pile, and the noise would have gained his attention even before his promotion.  He had first stiffened, caught off guard despite how many injured there were here in the camp, although once yellows met pinks he felt the tension wash away.  A smile broke out across his features as he recognized the cat who he had, for awhile, been convinced had joined so many of those cats he was close to that he couldn&#39;t save.  With swift movements, the tom approached Tigerpaw, his expression friendly and relieved.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Tigerpaw, you&#39;re alright!&quot;</em></strong></em> he exclaimed, tail raised high with the slightest arc at the tip, showing off the feeling of excitement that had now joined him.  He looked her up and down for a moment, trying to take in where she had been without pushing the question, and in the midst of the search he caught sight of the apprentice&#39;s crimson-stained paw pads.</span>

                Milk-tipped ears swerved back as he noticed the more hidden injury.  <em><strong><em>&quot;What happened?  Where were you?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked, finally voicing the question Tigerpaw must have been asked a million times already.  Last time he had seen her she didn&#39;t have the paw injuries she had now, and the blood was fairly fresh, too.  He felt the urge to bring Tigerpaw to the Medicine cat&#39;s den and have Fernpaw check out the subtle injury, but the bitter realization that Fernpaw wouldn&#39;t be healing any more paw pads came back to him, draining a large amount of his previously joyful energy.  Tigerpaw was a part of the many cats that needed medical assistance yet couldn&#39;t yet receive it, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel guilty.  He was the cat in charge of giving them that assistance, anyhow, and here he was, standing uselessly with paws matted with mud and dirt from digging.  Sure, he had opened up his den not long after he had been chosen to take his friend&#39;s place, and it was an oddly easy task at that, with the dirt already seeming fairly loose, but once he had entered it everything was covered in dirt, mud, and more ruin.  The herbs were destroyed, not a single survivor, and the small pool that Fernpaw had kept the mossballs besides had filled with mud during the disaster.  He had work ahead of him, <em>a lot</em> of work.  Unfortunately, he wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything about it until they opened the entrances.</span>

<em><strong><em>- Near Future-</em></strong></em>

The tom&#39;s silent debating was interupted as a noise came to his ears, one that quite clearly came from another cat.  Ears perking our of surprise and a bit of curiousity, he turned to spot a fem he didn&#39;t completely recognize at his side.  It caught him off guard to hear his own voice when he had been standing there in silence, only hearing the quiet shifting of the dirt beaneath his was for quite awhile.  Unable to help it, he kept eye contact with the she-cat for a few moments more, trying hard to try and remember her name.  Why was it so tricky to memorize all of the cats in his own clan?  It should have been easy, yet it was always a struggle for him.  Finally, though, a name came to mind.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh, hi... Hollowgrove,&quot;</em></strong></em> he greeted, hesitating for just a moment before speaking the name in fear that it was incorrect.  
 
                It didn&#39;t take long for a considerate offer to be made, and the young warrior didn&#39;t exactly expect it.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Help-?&quot;</em></strong></em> he repeated, although before he could continue much farther the other warrior already set off to work.  Pausing, a small smile crossed his muzzle.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh, thank you, it&#39;s appreciated... I wish there wasn&#39;t so much dirt, or it might not be as much of a hassle.&quot;</em></strong></em> he said softly, standing up to get back to work when Hollowgrove continued.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not sick-&quot;</em></strong></em> He began, before he realized he hadn&#39;t heard all she had to say.  Feeling his chest get a little bit heavier with the mention of his emotions along with the rest of the clans, it took him a few seconds before he nodded in agreement to her words.  Raising a paw, he began the laboring process of scooping dirt away from the camp wall again before he began to speak.</span>

               <em><strong><em>&quot;I guess I&#39;m not usually very confident in many things, but this whole.. landslide business hasn&#39;t been the easiest.&quot;</em></strong></em> he admitted.  He knew that none of the cats in the clan were having any fun with this, other than perhaps a few that remained out of his knowledge and hidden among the ranks of those sharing in his suffering, even if each cat in the camp had a bit of a different flavor of sorrow and stress than others.  A few scoops managed to fit themselves into the time of silence before he sent a glance over to his companion.  <em><strong><em>&quot;How are you today, other than... well, I guess there&#39;s not much to be said about all of this..&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, feeling a bit awkward as his attempt at normal conversation.  It felt only right to ask about the other feline&#39;s emotions, but at the same time the answer was quite easy to guess, with everything that was going on.

<em>Me? Going out without a warrior?</em> The thought sent a tingle of excitement up the young cats spine. He had only been an apprentice for a short time before the landslide, and now he was going out to hunt without his mentor!

&quot;I&#39;m not very good,&quot; Adderpaw admitted, giving Wrenpaw a sheepish smile.&#160;

It was truly an embarrassment. An apprentice that couldn&#39;t even hunt. Not that he hadn&#39;t been taught, he just wasn&#39;t very good at it. At all.

Once the shock had faded from her voice, pure relief took over. <strong>&quot;Boy is it good to see you-&quot;</strong>

Where had she been? The apprentice flinched and receded at that question. Her weariness visibly flooded back into her. Her gaze dropped. <strong>&quot;I don&#39;t wanna talk about it,&quot;</strong> mumbled the tabby miserably.

Wrenpaw gave the tom a reassuring nudge with a forepaw, offering him a kind smile. <strong>”That’s okay, none of us are when we first start out. Don’t worry, we can work together,”</strong> she said cheerfully. She’d had quite a few successful team hunting sessions in the past, and didn’t see why it wouldn’t work out now. Besides, if Adderpaw missed something there was a good chance Wrenpaw would be able to catch it. Despite a bit of a rocky start, the golden and brown apprentice had developed into quite the formidable huntress. In fact, it was one of the few things she was confident about. Perhaps she could spread some of that confidence to her new friend. 

<strong>”The clan needs all the prey it can get right now, and we apprentices are the only ones who can fit in and out right now. It’ll be great practice!”</strong> Although their current situation was bleak, there was still opportunity for the apprentices to better themselves because of it. They had been giving a lot more responsibilities, and chances were each and every apprentice would come out the other side of this with more enhanced skills. At least, that’s what she hoped for. It was best to see the positives, right? <strong>”I’ll help you. And if you’re really that bad, you can just chase the prey to me. Distracted prey is easy prey, and you can be the distraction.”</strong> Was that reassuring? She hoped so. The last thing she wanted was to make the tom feel worse. <span class="mention" title="Ginger#8317">@Ginger</span></span>

<em><strong><em>• Present •</em></strong></em>

It was such a relief to see Tigerpaw here and overall well, besides her paw pads of course.  He had lost too many cats over the past few days, and too much change was approaching him much too quickly.  It would have been helpful to be warned before all of this so that he would be a little bit more prepared, although perhaps they just missed the warning.  It had been so rainy and stormy for so many days, and at this time and season, it was far from normal.  How could they have missed the message?  They could have saved so many lives, kept so many that they loved... Yet here they were, and he absolutely despised it.  He felt more bitter than he ever had before, although it wasn&#39;t towards any cats, but his own negligence and uselessness.  The tom was a bit startled at Tigerpaw&#39;s reluctance to catch him up on what happened, but he didn&#39;t push her.  No, instead he did a small nod in acknowledgment of the desire, leaving the topic behind with the gesture.  

            Marigolddust&#39;s attention was immediately caught at the sound of the name that had caused him the most sorrow these past few days, the name no longer sounding as sweet as honey.  Instead, it felt quite the opposite, with it&#39;s sweet berries poisoned from more sadness than the tom had ever experienced before.  Some of his resurfaced sorrow leaked to the surface as he met the strawberry gaze of the tabby&#39;s, eyes watering slightly despite his efforts to hold it back.  Other cats sometimes built a stone wall over their expressions to keep others from recognizing their emotions, but he had never been good at such a thing.  Adverting his gaze, he looked up towards the sky as he tried to come up with the right words.</span>

             <em><strong><em>&quot;L..Laurelblaze... doesn&#39;t think Fernpaw&#39;s going to be returning any time soon...&quot;</em></strong></em> He murmured softly, hating how horridly sour the sound of his own words made him feel.  He wished that the topic hadn&#39;t turned to this, but at the same time, someone had to tell Tigerpaw, and who better than the cat who would be taking the sandalwood&#39;s place?  He hated to have to be the one to ruin the hope shining so brightly in the apprentice&#39;s gaze, but he couldn&#39;t come up with an excuse for a topic so serious and close to home.

Needlestripe hooked his tail around Wolfshine and pulled her close, furrowing his brow. Troubled golden eyes met the apprentice. <strong>&quot;It&#39;s not safe in any of the dens,&quot;</strong> he agreed.

A silver paw hooked the bundle back into sight. Wolfshine had nothing to worry about - he had already thought this through. <strong>&quot;Wrenpaw,&quot;</strong> he said with purpose, pushing the leaf wrap towards her. <strong>&quot;This... was all we found. Take it up to Finchbriar. We can&#39;t risk the clan&#39;s last herbs getting lost in here.&quot;</strong> He could see the tawny semi-tabby roaming at the top of the camp&#39;s edge. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span> <span class="mention" title="tremb#3692">@tremb</span> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> forgot to move woop)</span>

<em><strong><em>• Present •</em></strong></em>

<em>Without a medicine cat...</em> The thought gave him conflicted emotions.  Should it make him upset at the idea that Fernpaw was no longer there, or proud at the fact that he made sure such a situation never happened?  Looking over, Marigolddust focused his gaze on Tigerpaw again, suddenly feeling figity at the idea of what he was going to say.  Twitching an ear, he looked down at his paws, rubbing one against the other in an effort to keep his mind on what was to be said, not what might come as a response.  <em><strong><em>&quot;W-well, Icestar and Laurelblaze *did</em> choose another medicine cat...&quot;</strong></em> He said softly, and for a moment it seemed like he wouldn&#39;t continue.  But finally, he spoke again, although his mouse was little more than a soft murrmer.  

               <em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;ll be a very good one, though... Not quite as good as Fernpaw...&quot;</em></strong></em> he mumbled, whether to himself or Tigerpaw, it was hard to tell.  He found that he had very little confidence in himself when it came to his new rank, especially when it was mentioned while also being on the topic of his absent friend.  He still didn&#39;t understand what made him worthy of such a role, or why Starclan decided they&#39;d replace Fernpaw with a cat who would likely be unable to do the job half as well as her.  Was Starclan&#39;s goal to tear the clan apart slowely?  Or was this the Dark forest&#39;s doing?  Whoever was in charge of this, they were doing their job well, if what he expected was truly their goal.  The camp was a wreck, their leader lost a life, and a new, inexperienced and amateur Medicine cat was chosen at a time where cats needed professional healing more than anything.

The molly’s deep orange gaze widened in horror at the herbs that the warrior presented her with, dark brown ears laying flat against her skull. Every new apprentice was taught about death berries and how terribly dangerous they were, because apprentices were often too curious for their own good. <strong>”D-death berries?”</strong> She asked. If that was the only herb they had managed to salvage from the medicine den, then StarClan help them all. Furthermore, she wasn’t entirely certain why Needlestripe wanted her to bring them to another warrior instead of just destroying them right away. Then again, it wasn’t exactly safe to keep them anywhere inside the camp, either. She also had to remind herself that warriors were too large to exit the camp themselves, so the job would be best carried out by an apprentice anyways. 

Wrenpaw gave herself a little shake to calm her nerves, followed by a small dip of her head to the two warriors. <strong>”I’ll take them to Finchbriar. Surely he will know how to dispose of them properly so that no one gets hurt. Right?”</strong> She wasn’t entirely comfortable with the idea of carrying death berries, but she would do anything to help her clan. After all, what kind of clanmate woulds she be if she didn’t play her part in removing potential dangers from the camp? Finchbriar was a prickly warrior, but was trustworthy nonetheless and would surely protect the clan the same way any other warrior would. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span> <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

Adderpaw beamed at the idea, his deep amber eyes glowing. He crouched down playfully, tail sticking straight up into the sky, and grinned at Wrenpaw.&#160;

&quot;I&#39;ll be the <em>best</em> distraction!&quot;&#160;

He couldn&#39;t believe the excitement bubbling through him. Just the thought that another cat, even another apprentice, was taking any sort of interest in him sent a warmth through his heart. He would have to prove himself to the femme, prove that he was worthy of the time and effort. He would be devastated if she decided he wasnt worth it.&#160;

His dark tabby fur, still fuzzy with kitten fluff in places, had smoothed down since his overjoyed outburst. Long claws kneaded the soft earth as he glanced over at Wrenpaw once more.

&quot;Are you ready? We can go now, if you want,&quot; Adderpaw offered, his tail tip twitching behind him.&#160;&#160;

She giggled at his energetic display, feeling some of her usual giddiness coming back as well. She had never been the type to mope around, but today had been different until Adderpaw came along. Usually she was the one trying to cheer up other cats, so it was sort of nice to have the role reversed for a change. <strong>”Don’t worry, you’re gonna make a fine hunter. Practice makes perfect,”</strong> she said with a grin. 

She gave an eager nod of her head, and though her stomach was rumbling and her paws were sore, she stood up anyways. She was always ready to work for her clanmates, no matter how much her body protested it sometimes. <strong>”I’m ready,”</strong> she assured him. 

She thought back to a day only a few moons prior when she had told Marigolddust that she would never get tired. That she felt like she had enough energy to get her through even the hardest of days. Wrenpaw began to realize now that had been a lie. At this moment, she yearned for the energy she had when she’d first been apprenticed. Food had been scarce and repairing the camp was a full time job, it had everyone feeling a bit run down. She began to pad towards the camp barrier, finding a spot both apprentices could squeeze through. (It’s okay! Take your time c: next post in territory?) <span class="mention" title="Ginger#8317">@Ginger</span></span>

The she cat felt bad about her earlier stunt. She should have known that he would use Wrenpaw to deliver to the berries. Wolfshine was after all a senior warrior. No one would question her. No one has ever had a reason to. At the apprentice’s uncertainty, she let her warm gaze reach the smaller cat.
<strong>” Exactly Wrenpaw. That would be great if you could do that for us. And thanks for being so helpful.”</strong> she bent her head to meet the young cat’s gaze, <strong>” We all really appreciate it. You sure will make Thunderclan proud!”</strong>
She felt guilty. Tricking this poor apprentice was wrong. But unfortunately, this was the only way. She pressed her flank against Needlestripe. Today, they had done well.

<em>You sure will make ThunderClan proud!</em> 

Hearing that coming from the mouth of one of ThunderClan’s senior warriors immediately made a grin appear upon Wrenpaw’s face. Wolfshine was right! She would be doing a good thing for her clan in making sure these berries were removed from the camp, and kept away from young kits who might think they looked tasty. <strong>”Thank you, Wolfshine. I won’t let you down! I’ll take care of these right away,”</strong> she said, quickly scooping the bundle up gently in her jaws. She dipped her head respectfully in farewell to the two warriors before heading towards the camp barrier where she could find a place to squeeze out. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span> <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

In the time since the landslide, Laurelblaze and the rest of ThunderClan that had been fit for duty had been at work trying to restore the entrances around camp. Earth caked their paws and their fur, loose boulders pushed aside to make room for those trying to unearth their collapsed exits. They were so close to getting out, they’d breached the surface on the other side just recently, but it was still too snug for a grown warrior to fit through just yet, they were <em>so</em> close. Since this milestone had occurred in their recovery, Laurelblaze had been elbows-deep in dirt and rocks as she was heading up the excavation effort, using her strength to her advantage as she raked her claws through the walls of the quarry. She wasn’t alone, thankfully, her clanmates had been a great help in their efforts of restoring their camp back to its original state, and she couldn’t be more grateful to them for their assistance. If it weren’t for them, they might never have gotten this far. She was so proud of them, and wouldn’t stop praising them for their hard work for moons to come. <em>We can do this!</em>

The brawny tortoiseshell let out a loud grunt as she gripped her claws against one of the heavier boulders she could latch them around. Most of the time with the bigger stones they’d dislodged the earth around them to get them to move out of the way. It was risky, essentially causing a miniature collapse, but it was controlled for the most part. Still, someone could easily get hurt if they weren’t careful, thus with the smaller ones, manual power was better for the job. She snarled as she pulled backwards, feeling the stone shift under her weight as she finally ripped it free, another obstacle cleared, but they weren’t finished. She was exhausted.

<strong>”Come on… I can get this cleared today, I know it! I wanna get the hell outta here already!”</strong>

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

<em>&quot;Well, who is it?&quot;</em>  The question made Marigolddust hesitate; hesitate even more than he had just moments before.  What was he supposed to say?  He knew that she had to know, and he was going to tell her, even if his mind yelled at him to just cover the conversation with a new topic, hiding the knowledge under new words.  Wincing at the mere idea of Tigerpaw&#39;s response, he began quietly at first, although his voice gained more volume the longer he spoke.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, he&#39;s a bit... *tall</em>... and he has golden eyes, dark and light grey fur, and... he&#39;s sitting in front of a particular brown tabby..&quot;**</strong></em> His voice returned to a soft whisper as he said the last words.  How would she react?  She already seemed a bit hopeless and disappointed.  Would knowing that he was the cat who was meant to heal the clan provide her with any reassurance?  Oh, he sure hoped so.  Or... did he?  What if he messed this up, and caused her reassurance to be crushed among the debris lying here in the camp?  

<em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;m still not the most sure in their decision, but I&#39;m hoping they chose correctly.&quot;</em></strong></em> he added, his voice no longer as quiet but his tone remaining just as unsure and disappointed.  Not even he believed he would do nearly as well as Fernpaw, and even the fact that he had stepped up to the plate when the clan truly needed it no longer provided him with as much comfort as it had.  He felt ashamed to have so little confidence in Starclan&#39;s choice, but how could he be as sure as them in a decision like this?  Well, as long as he was able to at least slow the harm that the injuries gained in the clan, he might have some hope yet, but he wasn&#39;t even able to do that.  Not yet.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tigerpaw&#39;s pink eyes held wide and round. She blinked at him a couple times, processing the allusion. <strong>&quot;It&#39;s... you?&quot;</strong> first her guess was barely audible. Then the apprentice snapped to her paws, striped fur spiking. <strong>&quot;It&#39;s you, isn&#39;t it? Is it really?&quot;</strong>

The excitement in her weary voice had grown. Tigerpaw looked him up and down again as if he were a new cat. Finally a grin bloomed on her face. <strong>&quot;Marigolddust, medicine cat of ThunderClan.&quot;</strong> Even if the circumstances of his promotion weren&#39;t ideal, she was happy for him. The younger she-cat stepped forward and nuzzled his cheek lightly, a faint purr quivering her chin. <strong>&quot;You&#39;ll do great,&quot;</strong> she assured him, then her expression sobered again.

<strong>&quot;Sorry about Fernpaw...&quot;</strong> <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

<em><strong><em>• Present •</em></strong></em>

The positive reaction caused Marigolddust to falter, taken aback by what was going on.  He blinked, confused.  <em><strong><em>&quot;U-um- yeah, yeah it&#39;s me,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, although his voice didn&#39;t sound nearly as bewildered as he felt.  She seemed just as excited as Laurelblaze when he had accepted the rank, and it would be an understatement to say that he was startled.  This wasn&#39;t exactly the response he expected, and he wasn&#39;t sure how he was supposed to think of it.  A smile slowely formed on his lips as she said his name and new rank besides one another, although his ears had yet to adjust to the foreign words.  It didn&#39;t sound like the two were meant to be combined, but at the same time it didn&#39;t sound <em>too</em> terrible... although there was still sorrow strung through the title.  A small purr was his initial reaction to her affectionate nudge, and he smiled again at her reassuring statement.  Laurelblaze and Icestar had said something similar to that, too.  Perhaps that meant something?  Was it possible that he might end up being alright at his new role?  Even if the words gave him some confidence, he knew that healing the cats of the clan was a large job for any, and likely every, cat who had been assigned it.  It wasn&#39;t going to be easy, being a medicine cat, but he hoped that things might just work out alright.  

                 The mention of Fernpaw did well as depleting his previous positivity, causing his smile to fade.  He couldn&#39;t help but curl his tail close to his side, twitching it slightly in an effort to flick off the new uncomfortable feeling of grief.  Sure, he was well aware that his friend might not be coming back, but it was taking longer than he expected for it to sink in.  The thought always saddened him, just as much as when he woke up in the morning to see that Fernpaw wasn&#39;t among the many cats with him in the camp, or more of a prison, at this point.</span>

                Quieting, he gave Tigerpaw a small nod, hesitation dragging the first syllable of what he said next as he looked over the camp.  <em><strong><em>&quot;It&#39;s.. alright... I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s probably mourning her, huh?&quot;</em></strong></em> He said softly, not exactly facing Tigerpaw as he said the words.  He was probably not the only cat in this camp feeling such a strong sense of pain... Fernpaw had been the whole clan&#39;s medicine cat, anyhow, and she wasn&#39;t only his friend.  It felt selfish to feel sorry for himself when there were so many others to feel sorry for.

A glance to the top of the quarry, where the forest loomed beyond. <strong>&quot;Let me fetch some herbs for you,&quot;</strong> offered the apprentice, pushing aside her weariness and pain in favor of an eager desire to help her friend. Not just him, but the whole clan. <strong>&quot;What do you need?

Ragged breath rasped alongside Laurelblaze, one of many struggling to breathe with dirt and dust coating their tongues and throat. Gingerstep had been working tirelessly alongside her clanmates, clawing at that wall day and night, scarcely eating during the few breaks they took. She was exhausted. Her small body was bruised and battered, covered in scrapes and cuts. And now, after so much work at the landslide, her paws were torn and bloody.&#160;

The young warrior had been changed by the tradgedy that befell their home, and when she looked at Laurelblaze, that usual glowing light was dimmed beyond compare. Still, they flared slightly at the sight of her, at the words she spoke. As if the deputy were a fan to her dying flame.&#160;

&quot;What, you&#39;re not having a good time?&quot; Gingerstep panted, her voice rough and raspy. She offered the tortoiseshell a small smile, eyes glowing just a bit, before squeezing in closer. Together, they could finish this, they could escape. Together, they could set their clan free.

Adderpaw was on his feet in an instant. With a wild grin and a mischievous glint in his eyes, the young tom batted playfully at her ears before leaping away.&#160;

&quot;Last one there&#39;s a mouse-brain!&quot;&#160;

He turned and ran, tail streaming behind him. He wasn&#39;t the fastest cat, but by Starclan he was going to try. Dark tabby fur barreled towards the hole in the camp entrance, struggling to squeeze through in his rush.&#160;

<em><strong><em>• Present •</em></strong></em>

With a small, soft purr he nodded.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I hope so.&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, his voice fairly quiet with a hint of hope, although it sounded as if it would easily be overrun by sorrow.  The tom sure hoped that Tigerpaw was right, but at the same time he knew that what she said wasn&#39;t certain, no matter how sure she sounded of herself.  They couldn&#39;t find anything relating to Fernpaw anywhere besides the medicine cat&#39;s den, and it seemed like she had just... <em>Disappeared</em>.  Although, there were still possibilities of them finding Fernpaw, as not all of the debris had been cleared yet and she could have been outside of camp when the landslide occurred.  Was it a bit cynical of him, thinking about the negatives when Tigerpaw was trying to be so reassuring?  Of course part of him believed her, and believed that he was just holding Fernpaw&#39;s place until she returned.  But, another part of him told him that, if she hadn&#39;t returned yet, then she won&#39;t.  They were two conflicting sides, and it was tricky for him to try and decide whether one or the other was true.  Perhaps they both might be accurate, where Fernpaw escaped but couldn&#39;t come back?  Had she been injured, and that&#39;s why she wasn&#39;t here now?  What would he do then?

             Blinking, he was snapped out of his thoughts as he heard Tigerpaw&#39;s offer.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Really?  You wouldn&#39;t mind?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, pleasantly surprised by the offer.  Maybe if he had some herbs he wouldn&#39;t feel quite so useless, even if everyone else in the clan was unable to do just as much as him.  Perhaps he could heal some of the injuries with an herb or two if he requested them, and he could have a head start of sorts.  Relieved by the very idea of finally being able to do <em>something</em> with his new role, he tried to come up with herbs that were necessary at the moment.  It was tricky, knowing exactly what he needed when he hardly knew any of the non-basic herbs, but two particular ones came to mind.</span>

<em><strong><em>&quot;Well, moss would be handy, perhaps soaked in fresh water if you can find any and don&#39;t mind, and perhaps some marigold, too, if all of it isn&#39;t destroyed.  You should have an easier time finding it in the meadow,&quot;</em></strong></em> he explained, hoping that it was enough detail and not too much for the apprentice to handle.  With wet moss he could slow some bleeding, although there was no clear water remaining in the camp to do such a job.  He could crush or chew marigolds and spread the poulice on injuries to make some effort against infections.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Thank you, Tigerpaw.&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, a grateful and perhaps excited shimmer going through his eyes.

The deputy had always tried to be a role model to her clanmates, even if in the time before she became deputy she wasn’t exactly the best one. She’d made mistakes in the past, she caused trouble wherever she could find it. Butting heads with other cats was a common problem she had back then, and occasionally it reared its ugly head nowadays. She wasn’t perfect, but she wanted to inspire loyalty and motivation from her clanmates. She wanted to be seen as a paragon of ThunderClan’s warriors. Exemplifying their courage, their strength, and most of all their camaraderie as clanmates. By working together, they could conquer all of the obstacles laid out in front of them.

<strong>”Well, its not every day I’m hauling rocks out of the tunnel leading out of camp, am I?”</strong> she let out a half-hearted chuckle at the comment made by the younger warrior. It was cramped in here with her helping her dig the way out, but they didn’t have time to make it seem all pretty and smooth like it was before. She’d be stuck crawling for the next few days, but maybe she could make a plea to Icestar to expand the camp entrance so she <em>didn’t</em> have to inch her way through every single time. For now, this would be enough, just so everyone could finally get out into the forest and make up for the time they lost from being trapped in here. <em>It’ll boost morale too, they’ll be happy to stretch their legs again and to see the forest finally.</em>

<strong>”That light is the only thing that has been keeping me going, its taunting me at this rate.”</strong> she huffed quietly, claws scraping at the earth below as she broke through more earth. They were nearly there, but it still required more work, enough to free them all. If she could squeeze through the hole leading out of camp, so could everyone else at this rate. <strong>”I want to see the trees again, its all I’m hoping for now. We need to get out.”</strong>

The young femme let out a soft huff, amber eyes flickering with amusement. It was true, they all wanted to be free of the camp, even if it was their home. They wanted to see the trees overhead and feel the grass underpaw. They wanted to run wild and free through their territory, relish in every blade of grass and gust of wind. Soon. Soon, they would all be free. They just had to keep digging.&#160;

&quot;I&#39;m gonna sleep out in the territory for a moon,&quot; Gingerstep announced, only half joking. She let out a soft laugh, even if it did feel like claws raking down her throat. Hell, it felt like someone had dragged their claws along her whole body. She had only suffered minor injuries during the <em>event,</em>&#160;but the work that followed had caused more damage. Her soft fur was in ruins, tattered and ragged, and the vibrant colors had vanished. The bright ginger and snowy white had melted together beneath layers and layers of earth. No longer was she a pretty orange and white tabby, now she was just...brown.&#160;

In all honesty, the young warrior didn&#39;t care much about the destruction of her fur. She had witnessed horrible things in such a short time. Clanmates had been horribly injured, buried alive, and even killed. Whenever she closed her eyes, all she could see was the death and destruction. She could still hear Laurelblazes cry after Icestar had been crushed, could still hear that sickening crunch of bones. It still twisted her stomach when she thought of it.

Gingerstep had lived an easy, carefree life before, unaware of how horrible things could truly be. She knew now what the world could do. She knew it had changed her, perhaps damaged her, in a way that would never be mended. But the warrior didn&#39;t fear the world. No, this was just a lesson, and she was listening. Enjoy those moments where things seem good, even if they&#39;re not perfect, because you never know when the good will be stripped away.

These kinds of things happened in life, it was impossible for a single lifetime to pass without experiencing pain or major loss. Their lives were never easy, and often it felt as if their ancestors were unfairly testing them to see how much they could take before cracking under pressure. All under the guise of “seeing how a warrior would step up and excel under a great ordeal.” In a way, she felt it was unnecessarily cruel, even if they didn’t cause <em>every</em> single disaster. Still, if one of them decided to show up and explain it was a test, she’d likely start swinging her claws at them for it. Her family suffered, her son was severely injured and wasn’t recovering well from the lack of herbs they had and without an experienced healer. She held no resentment towards Marigolddust for this of course, but she wished Fernpaw was around right now so Featherpaw had someone to rely on with a bit more trust. Not only that, but she lost an old friend, Rooksnap to the landslide. Needless to say, she was put under quite a bit of duress.

<strong>”I hear ya. There’s nothing I hate more than being confined to camp against my will. This isn’t the first time it’s happened for me, believe it or not.”</strong> how it happened, she didn’t plan to elaborate on. She’d actually been grounded before as a warrior for acting insubordinate, and that was the reason why. Looking back on it now was a bit embarrassing for her, so she wasn’t going to talk much more on the subject. <strong>”Just a little more now. I think its enough room for if I stuck my head through. We just need to widen it a bit more for everyone and we’ll have a working entrance!”</strong> her clawing grew more desperate, quicker as she was kicking dirt down below. She’d likely have to groom herself for the next moon if she wanted to get all this dirt off, but it was worth it. They were going to get out, their clanmates would be freed at last!

The younger she-cat kept quiet, the only sound between them being the scrape of their paws against the earth. She wore a weary frown, seeming either deep in thought or absent altogether.

{SPARROWFEATHER}

It had been difficult for awhile to clear the camp. It had been a moon. Sparrowfeather had found she had a broken rib. It hurt to breath- but it was getting better. Back when Fernpaw had treated everyone’s wounds…She was lucky she got to talk to the old friend before they left. But Thunderclan had plenty of new problems too. Cats seemed to be getting sick… but Sparrowfeather top priority was clearing the dens. Despite her rib, she- maybe, was supposed to not do anything heavy.. but no one was going to wait. The camp certainly wasn’t gonna wait for her rib to heal… The camp was a wreck- but they could move around. So Sparrowfeather went to find Pinefoot or Sandstride to help her. She trotted around the clearing Looking up in the trees to maybe catch a hint of Clo. Sparrowfeather didn’t see the irritable bird so she continued to look for the warriors.</span>

Noticing the deputys quickened pace, Gingerstep found herself growing more frantic as well, clawing at the walls with renewed fervor. She felt the mud and rock tear at her talons, threatening to yank them out with every move. But it didn&#39;t matter. The pain was nothing, because they were about to get out. They were about to be free.

With a thrash of her tail, Gingerstep leaned into her paws, putting all of her weight against the remaining wall. A soft growl of determination escaped her maw and her amber eyes turned fiery as she felt a shift in the mud. With one final push, the remaining wall crumbled around them, showering the cats with debris. As the opening finally yawned around them, Gingerstep struggled to lean back - too late. The delicate feline stumbled forward, tumbling through the opening with paws flailing.&#160;

The young femme finally stopped as she slammed onto her back, snowy belly to the sky. Gazing back at Laurelblaze, the ginger tabby sprouted a wicked grin, pure joy and relief shining in her eyes. They were free. A rough laugh escaped her, beautiful and free as ever.

<em><strong><em>• Close Future •</em></strong></em>

A lot of cats had been getting sick recently, but unfortunately the cat who had the job of curing this sickness was too oblivious to be of much help.  The sudden illness was add, at least from what Marigolddust could tell.  It had sprung out of nowhere, cat after cat complaining about how they felt nauseous, sick, or how they often vomited.  It was concerning, to say the least, to have such a pandemic break out during such a trying time.  Buy what could have caused it?  Almost everybody in the clan seemed to be having <em>some</em> sort of symptoms that others have shared, but so many cats got it in such a short amount of time that it couldn&#39;t have possibly been just contagious.  It wasn&#39;t rational for a contagious sickness to spread at such speed, was it?  It seemed more logical to assume that it came from a source in particular, although what source, Marigolddust couldn&#39;t be sure.  The clan had such minimal resources, but one of them <em>must</em> have been the culprit... Oh, it was far more stressful to be the one needing to deal with such problems than be the assistant, and although he had expected it, he didn&#39;t think he would need to deal with such a situation so... <em>Early</em>.  So, it was up to him, and Laurelblaze and Icestar, too, to figure out what was causing all of this.  Could it be mold that had formed in the rubble?  Maybe some sort of fumes were coming from the fallen soil that had yet to release until the landslide allowed it to.  Perhaps the landslide had affected outside prey or the water in camp, causing something to make it dirty or dangerous?  

              Personally, Marigolddust seemed to be feeling the lesser parts of the sickness.  He felt nauseous and sometimes had a bit of a stomach ache, but otherwise he was fine.  It was the towers he was worried about, and one of these others seemed to be... <em>Getting rid of</em> whatever was infecting the clan.</span>

                  Ears perking at the sound of the retching, he reluctantly followed the noise, curious and concerned over who it was.  Multiple cats came to mind, all of whom he could only hope weren&#39;t the source of the sound, although the feline that his eyes finally laid on wasn&#39;t the most expected. 

                 <em><strong><em>&quot;Wolfprowl-?&quot;</em></strong></em> He stated, a bit too startled to keep the name trapped in his thoughts.  Instead, the syllables escaped through his teeth as he spoke them, each sound a bit more hesitant than usual.  Marigolddust wasn&#39;t quite sure what he thought of his brother.  He didn&#39;t really like him all that much, which was saying a lot when it came to the tux, but at the same time he was family.  Did family count for anything if the bridge between them had been burned, though?  This was the very cat who had pushed hi out of a tree as a kit, and the same one who had bullied him the whole way back to camp.  The stormy toned tom had even changed his name to conclude his dislike towards those who shared his blood, and Marigolddust always found it difficult to fake a friendly smile around the tom.  But, now was one of those resentful times.  Putting on a small mask of a smile, he approached his younger brother.  <em><strong><em>&quot;A..are you alright?  Is there any way I can help?&quot;</em></strong></em> Even though there was no other cat that he would rather try and avoid, he knew that it was his job to check up on every cat, no matter the past that he had with them.  At least he knew <em>that</em> about being a medicine cat.

There was no extra hostility in his decline; he was too busy vomiting to notice who had approached him. When the fit was finally over he raised his head level with his hunched shoulders and looked at his company.

<strong>&quot;Oh.. Marigolddust, it&#39;s you.&quot;</strong> Tone flat, face unmoving. The brothers were uncanny in appearance yet the warrior hardly treated him like they were family.

<em><strong><em>• Close Future •</em></strong></em>

The young tom&#39;s muzzle could only wrinkle in disgust as the smell finally hit him, and he tried to not focus on the result of the noises he heard coming from the other tom too hard.  The whole situation was a bit disgusting, but he held back any gagging that might have come as a result.  The least he could do was be a little polite while his Wolfprowl was... Getting over things.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh, um, no, not exactly.  I was just.. wondering who might have been having some troubles,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, unsure how else to word the idea.  He didn&#39;t know how to say many things correctly around the familiar yet foreign tom, and only reluctance and assumptions came easily at times such as now.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I just came to see if I could help whoever might have been the source, or *you</em>, in this case,&quot;*</strong></em> he clarified, trying to push down the awkward feeling stirring in his gut.  
    
                 His brother&#39;s tone wasn&#39;t nearly as welcoming as one might have expected from family, but Marigolddust had grown to expect it.  At first he had thought that he himself was the only problem to the smoky feline in front of him, but not too long ago, his brother had made a choice that disowned his own family.  <em>Let him disown us, he&#39;s just going to bring himself more loneliness.</em>  The sour thought made him flinch, caught by surprise.  He hadn&#39;t meant to think something like that at all, but it just came naturally.  The cat in front of him was the only one he would think such thoughts about, and although he felt guilty for his mind&#39;s words, he also couldn&#39;t say that he didn&#39;t mean them.  Marigolddust&#39;s time with Wolfprowl had all been negative, and even though he himself had grown distant from their family, too, he felt resentful towards the other.  Sure, a cat could stay away from his family, but making it known that he despised them enough to change his own given name was too far.</span>

To put it simply, Marigolddust couldn&#39;t help but view his brother as more of an edgy apprentice than a mature warrior. 

                 <em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;m assuming you might not need much assistance, taking into consideration that you don&#39;t seem too eager for it..&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, his voice quiet as he sent a glance down to the puddle that had formed.  Of course his brother needed help.  Almost every cat in the clan had to be assisted with their illnesses, but Marigolddust had hardly been given any time to try and fetch some herbs to assist those in need.  He could leave Wolfprowl for now, couldn&#39;t he?  From what it looked like, the warrior wasn&#39;t all too keen on receiving assistance from him, although even if he did, Marigolddust doubted he would figure out a proper solution.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot;</strong> was all he said, turning towards camp. Sure, his brother was the medicine cat now, but he doubted the other tuxedo had learned enough in the past couple days to be of any use. Wolfprowl walked slowly, a hunch lingering in his posture. He paused his steps as he passed the other tom, screwing his eyes shut as though his stomach had given another painful twist, before carrying on. He was definitely not fine. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

<em><strong><em>- Close Future -</em></strong></em>

Blood was the first real hint to the new medic that his brother wasn&#39;t as well as he claimed to be.  Although the scent of the crimson substance was dulled by the damp scent of the soil, there were still hints of it that managed to waft into the air, reaching Marigolddust&#39;s nose with a message as sharp as a thorn.  Sure, there had been plenty of retching going around the clan, but very few cats had a mixture of blood mixed into the bile.  It was definitely not a reassuring sign, and that was exactly why Marigolddust blocked Wolfprowl, done in a much more polite way than the action might have given off.  Releasing a sigh, Marigolddust closed his eyes for a moment, trying to put a claw down on what he was to do.  Opening his lemon-tinted gaze, he made an effort to try and look his brother in the eyes.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Look, me and you both know you&#39;re not fine.  Can you... at least just take it easy?&quot;</em></strong></em> he suggested, although the sound of the words sounded useless only to his own ears.  Why would Wolfprowl have any reason to listen to what he had to say?  <em>If only I knew a little more about all of this... then maybe I could actually be of some help.</em>  

                <em><strong><em>&quot;Maybe we could both go somewhere in camp and just relax, maybe share some sort of prey.  You could choose what, if you&#39;d like,&quot;</em></strong></em> he offered.  Marigolddust was giving it his best effort to try and figure out and help Wolfprowl somehow, even if he wasn&#39;t the most fond of the cat, and the warrior definitely didn&#39;t think very approvingly to the milk-dipped paw that Marigolddust was offering to him now.  But, despite the fact that Marigolddust would rather have found some other cat and assisted them, Wolfprowl was a clanmate and a cat in need.  It was Marigolddust&#39;s job to try and offer the tom some relief now.  It was a negative factor that Marigolddust had grown to recognize fairly quick, especially now.</span>

               He was giving it his all, or at least all he wasn&#39;t afraid to give, to make Icestar, Laurelblaze, and Starclan proud, even if they did choose quite the useless cat at such a troubling time.

As Gingerstep began the last leg of their excavation effort, her ears picked up on the crumbling and cracking of the earth from within the tunnel, and she felt her heart leap into her throat. When she saw the younger warrior burst her paw through a shallow section of dirt, sending debris flying down the chute, she instinctively shut her eyes and held her breath as dirt and dust rained down from above. When everything finally settled, however, the light from outside streamed into the tunnel, basking their earth-stained forms in bright white sunlight. The deputy’s gaze widened, and she let out a loud cry of joy at the sight. <strong>”We did it!”</strong> she began to let out a fit of laughter out of relief. They were <em>free!</em>

She immediately began to race out of the camp entrance, scrambling to get out of the tunnel and out into the clearing leading to the woods. The tortoiseshell still couldn’t believe it, <em>freedom at last!</em> She was beaming, her exhaustion replaced by utter glee at the fact her clan was now able to leave camp again. They’d been freed from their earthen prison!

<strong>”Tell everyone! We’re out! We have a way out!”</strong>

Tigerpaw dug at the fallen camp wall feebly. Twilight was well upon the quarry now. The apprentice had been working all day every day non stop to re earn ThunderClan&#39;s trust, especially Laurelblaze&#39;s, who dug beside her.

The younger she-cat kept quiet, the only sound between them being the scrape of their paws against the earth. She wore a weary frown, seeming either deep in thought or absent altogether. Clearly something more than her guilt was bothering her though. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> repost)</span>

<em><strong><em>- Close Future -</em></strong></em>

The glare he received wasn&#39;t the most unexpected, although it did waver Marigolddust&#39;s confidence in convincing his brother to take care of himself.  Why was he trying on a cat who would likely ignore his advice any day, let alone one where he was as weak as now, over the so many elsewhere in camp needing the same medical help?  Despite the urge that Marigolddust felt to turn around and leave his brother as the tom seemed to want him to do, his reason overran the desire as, once again, he remembered the wavering strength behind Wolfprowl&#39;s movements and the distant look that overcame the tom&#39;s gaze, emphasizing the sickness enough to keep Marigolddust on his brother&#39;s back.  Furrowing his nonexistent eyebrows, Marigolddust listened to the warrior&#39;s excuse.  <em><strong><em>&quot;The clan can&#39;t use warrior&#39;s who can&#39;t think enough to take care of themselves, especially ones who are puking up their guts,&quot;</em></strong></em> he pointed out.  Wolfprowl was clearly not going to be much of a help in tasks such as hunting if he ended up retching before even catching a scent.  

               Finally, Wolfprowl agreed to <em>some</em> sort of assistance.  With the tension that had been sticking to his fur now washed away, he let loose a sigh of relief.  It had taken long enough for him to figure out how to get through this situation successfully, and now he finally had.  The only problem was, he didn&#39;t know what to do from here-on-out.  Sure, relaxing could give Wolfprowl&#39;s stomach a bit of a break, but he would be just as sick as he was when Marigolddust first found him once he stood again.  Who knows, maybe he would even loose all of their meal before he could digest it.  Marigolddust couldn&#39;t decide whether it was a positive thing, not having the sickness personally.</span>

                If he had the full punch of it, it would probably make him unable to focus on much work, but at the same time he would be able to know the symptoms when cats to stubborn to tell him came around.  Instead, he only had a small discomfort in his middle, even now.  He didn&#39;t feel the best, but he didn&#39;t feel as terrible as his brother must have.  

            Recently, he had been taking in less of every resource they had; he was eating less, drinking less, digging less... if you could think of something the clan was using during these trying times, then he was taking smaller morsels of it all.   It seemed to be working, almost concluding his idea that it was something with what they clan was using, but at the same time he might have just had a better immune system against it.  Either way, he had begun to feel his own ribs recently, even with the recent opening of the camp.  He wouldn&#39;t take in any less food than he already was, at least he wasn&#39;t planning on it, but he still knew it would probably be best if he figured out a treatment for what was going around.  If he didn&#39;t, then small meals might start catching up to him, making him even slimmer than he was naturally.  He would eat the normal amount as soon as he found out how to treat this illness; that way, even if his case of it got more severe, he would be able to treat himself along with the others.  It was better being hungry than retching what you <em>have</em> eaten out.</span>

                            <em><strong><em>&quot;Great,&quot;</em></strong></em> Marigolddust said, his tone still holding onto the relief that he felt.  This was going at least a bit better than he had expected, and that was a good thing.  Following next to young warrior, Marigolddust glanced sideways towards the other.  <em><strong><em>&quot;What would you like?  I&#39;ll go get whatever it is while you choose a place to sit.&quot;</em></strong></em> he offered.  He wanted to add, <em>as long as it isn&#39;t a vole or mouse,</em> afterwards, but he held his tongue.  Whatever Wolfprowl wanted, he would be fine with, although maybe he should double check the meal before they took a bite of it.  Maybe some prey was sick, and that was what was causing this?

He settled down on a moonlit stone several more strides away with a sigh, sounding like an elder rather than a strong young warrior. Wolfprowl was not one to show pain; if even he couldn&#39;t keep his symptoms completely in check, whatever was causing this sickness must be severe. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

<em><strong><em>- Close Future -</em></strong></em>

It was a bit scary, if Marigolddust were to be honest, seeing what a toll this illness had taken on his own brother.  Sure, any stomach bug might have caused something like this in some cats, but his brother had a strong immune system, and on top of that, he didn&#39;t often show much of his trouble when it came to most any sickness.  He began to realize how lucky he was to get off with so little symptoms as he looked over his brother, who of which now looked fairly pitiful.  With this realization, it didn&#39;t take much for Marigolddust to feel startled by Wolfprowl&#39;s response to the idea of food.  Sure, the smoky furred tom would likely end up loosing his food to become bile after their meal, but either way, he had to eat something, even if Marigolddust found himself so suspicious of the prey.  It seemed the most likely source of this sickness problem, since not everybody was digging, such as the kits.  

              He faltered when his own state was mentioned, sending a quick glance to his sides, he paused for just a moment before shaking his head.  <em><strong><em>&quot;No, I&#39;m fine.  You&#39;re the one who has to eat.  You need your strength if your going to get any better, and not eating is a great way to do the complete opposite.  At least take a few bites?&quot;</em></strong></em> he suggested.  This was beginning to become a little more difficult than he had once foresaw.  He had imagined his brother would have agreed to the meal, even if it was quite the absurd hope, and now he had to try once again to convince the warrior to do as he suggested.  There wasn&#39;t much difference in standing in place while retching and sitting around somewhere in camp, and he had looked forwards to this being a little easier than it was serving to be.</span>

               Why couldn&#39;t Wolfprowl be as tolerable as some other cats?  What other cats, he wasn&#39;t exactly sure quite yet, but he doubted that Fernpaw would have refused such recommendations.  Or would she, just as he was, to convince himself that he was helping himself and the clan both better?  No, no thinking about the lost sandalwood.  Now right now.  

           Raising his pale-furred tail, Marigolddust brushed it against his brother&#39;s shoulders before using it to gesture towards the prey pile, hoping the gentle prodding would get his attention better than his words.  The gesture was one that was often much more friendly than he felt now, and was meant for cats that were usually closer to him.  But, he was using it as a second-to-last resort of sorts.  <em><strong><em>&quot;You can&#39;t say that the prey doesn&#39;t look at least a little bit tempting.. can you?&quot;</em></strong></em></span>

She’d been overseeing much of the digging efforts in camp for the past few days, and had put her own apprentice to work as a form of punishment for her sudden disappearance from camp. She was worried sick, and Tigerpaw returned without any reason why she had left. She had scared her, she thought she might have died in the disaster, or went missing and ended up like one of those rogue bodies on the border. Laurelblaze was <em>very</em> protective over her pupils, she saw them as her responsibility. She had to set an example to them and to ensure they’d behave from now on. This was about the equivalent of nest duty for now, but she was sure Tigerpaw would learn from her mistake now. 

<strong>”How’s digging coming along for you?”</strong> she peered over towards the smaller molly with a raised brow, her claws raking into a patch of earth and ripping it out of the wall that acted as an obstacle in their way of freedom. Laurelblaze was determined to tear it down, they needed to clear it out before long, otherwise they’d start going hungry. Even she was starting to feel hunger pangs, but she resisted the urge to go and pick a piece of prey out of the pile to sate her hunger. They were surviving off of scraps at this point, they’d have to begin rationing prey until she could get patrols out again. <em>This is the worst…</em>

She too, was deep in thought in this moment.

It had been a few days into Tigerpaw’s punishment for her sudden desertion of the clan, but Laurelblaze knew she couldn’t keep it up forever. She had to train again eventually, but once they got the walls cleared. Tigerpaw would be allowed to leave camp to help with hunting before then though. It wasn’t like these rocks were going anywhere. Besides, based on her half-hearted response, Laurelblaze could already tell her apprentice wasn’t exactly “fine”.

<strong>”Nope, definitely not fine. You look like your head’s about to fall off your neck by how low its hanging.”</strong> an… interesting choice of words, but her point stood. Tigerpaw looked miserable, and Laurelblaze wasn’t a dense fool, she knew that look anywhere. Her gaze narrowed, and she stepped back from the wall for a moment, gesturing to her apprentice with a swish of her tail to do the same. She needed to see what was going on, this wasn’t normal behavior from the younger she-cat. Naturally, the deputy had to investigate.

<strong>”Now you know how much I hate lying, tell me what’s eating at you.”</strong>

Icestar’s paws were still raw from all the digging they had to do this week. Her pads were viciously cracked and dried blood caked the bottom of her toes. Marigolddust’s herb reserve was limited and as usual, the lynx-point had avoided the medicine cat den to allow her other Clanmates to get treated first. <em>When everything gets resolved, I will go straight to Marigolddust,</em> she promised herself.

She looked down from the Highledge, knowing that each and every cat down there was suffering like her. Mentally and physically. As part of her duty as leader, Icestar needed to boost morale and what better way than to celebrate the coming of a new warrior and medicine cat. 

<strong>” All those who are old enough to catch their own prey, gather around for a Clan meeting!”</strong> Hopefully, this worked.

Delicate paws skittered towards the highledge - while she had groomed herself there was a clear sign of a now-healed gash across her hind leg from the landslide; Rooksnap could have very well saved her from her death. The limp was already fading, however, and she had forced herself to groom and not just lie helplessly in her nest like her mother died.

Though-.. it could really count. Twice.

Pale violets rid itself of its usual fog and ears perking, the calico peered upwards.</span>

She wouldn&#39;t be the one to admit, but Cloverpaw was exhausted - she of course never was very expressive about any emotions aside from frustrations. The recent events had only pulled the black and white femme into a darker place. Rooksnap&#39;s loss hadn&#39;t hit close to home, or at least that&#39;s what she wanted everyone else to think. Quietly, she had told herself that she had to be the tough one in this situation.. and in turn she&#39;d even closed herself off from Blaze - her one and only outlet. 

Hearing Icestar was a change, a sign that life had to move on no matter the circumstances. Muscles aching, Cloverpaw rose from her laying position and slowly slithered her way closer to the high ledge, striking emerald gaze landed on the leader intensely. New ceremonies meant better times, or at least that&#39;s what she&#39;d been taught to think.</span>

<strong>”Ah. I see…”</strong>

In truth, she didn’t really know how to respond. She didn’t have someone she was fond of when she was Tigerpaw’s age. So she really didn’t have much advice to give on this front. When she was her apprentice’s age, all she was focused on was aiming to fight almost every single one of her peers in order to claim herself as the most powerful apprentice of ThunderClan at the time. She had a penchant for the rush of battle, rather than romance. Still, her apprentice seemed rather disheartened and down, she had to say something. <strong>”It happens sometimes, relationships are like that.”</strong> she murmured quietly, but she realized if she didn’t elaborate soon its meaning would most certainly be muddled. <strong>”Not always, though, I’m sure things will work out one day. Besides, you’re still young to be dealing with these things, give it some time.”</strong> Tigerpaw was still an apprentice, but she still wanted to give her a warning. Sometimes cats rushed into relationships without warning or care, and she didn’t want her to get hurt along the way. It was a serious topic to be dealing with. <strong>”If you want to talk, I’ll listen.”</strong>

The deputy gathered with the others at the foot of the Highledge, her gaze sweeping across the clearing as she saw many of her clanmates gathering together for the meeting Icestar had called for. She sat down in the clearing and sat up straight, watching the lynx-point she-cat from down below in the dilapidated camp.</span>

She wasted no time. The moment the last of her Clanmates settled below, Icestar stepped forward and set her chin. Her ragged build and mud-smeared pelt blended in with the rest but the fire in her eyes was no different from usual: it blazed it in its blue-green glory. 

<strong>” Life isn’t perfect,”</strong> she began. <strong>” It is a challenge. In order to succeed, we must overcome the hardships and since the beginning of the Clans, generations of ThunderClan warriors have been fighting to preserve the life of ThunderClan. Through their effort and sacrifice, this Clan has lived to see another day. That duty is now passed onto us.”</strong> Her gaze burned across the crowd.

 <strong>” The passing of Rooksnap and Fernpaw’s absence is truly a tragedy among this horrible turn of events. They were all amazing cats in both personality and loyalty and were committed in their hearts. We must mourn for them but never forget to honour them and the legacy they have created within the Clan. We must hope that they have made it to a safe and happy place where they can spend the rest of their lives.”</strong> Icestar would have never thought that their lives would remain absent from ThunderClan so soon. She took in a steady breath, continuing with her speech: 

<strong>” Despite what has happened, we must keep moving forward for the sake of ourselves and the Clan. We have to continue to work hard to find a way to clear the tunnels and bring everything back to its peaceful state. Hope is the most powerful weapon against these rising shadows. It’s the light that pierces even the darkest of eras. Life, while brutal, has hope growing in the corners. Use this hope I give you in order to pursue onward.&quot;</strong></span>

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Today was the day.  He knew, or at least believed that he knew, what Icestar&#39;s voice calling for the clan would eventually lead to.  He hadn&#39;t heard the call ever since the disaster of the landslide, and now that he heard it again it felt a little bit nastalgic, no matter how short the time was between then to now.  Perking his ears, he quietly padded up to the crowd.  At first he was about to sit where he usually did, but with a moment of hesitation and thought he decided it might be best to settle a little closer to Icestar&#39;s perch.  Whether he decided to do so to be a little more hidden or closer just incase he was called up, he wasn&#39;t quite sure.  It made him uncomfortable as he sat with his flank nearly touching others, and it was far from natural to him, but hopefully it would work well enough for whatever he meant to sit here for.  

             Icestar&#39;s voice met the young tom&#39;s ears once more, catching him off guard as she mentioned the losses of the two cats he was closed to.  Feeling a pang of pain hit his chest, he lowered his head and sent a glance to the cats around him.  Shouldn&#39;t he have known that the names were going to be mentioned?  It was much better to take care of their memory through the first ceremony prior, even if it <em>did</em> sting.  Biting his tounge, he looked towards Icestar again, trying not to get any more distracted from his thoughts than he already was.  <em>Marbledpaw?</em> The ceremony was a bit unexpected, despite how normal it was supposed to be.  Marigolddust, although feeling guilty, couldn&#39;t help but be confused on whether he should be excited or not.  This was an amazing day for the young she-cat, and usually cats he knew getting their names was always exciting, even if it was yet another bringing of change.</span>

         Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t such an amazing time, although it would hopefully lighten the spirits of the Thunderclanners, or at least Marbledpaw herself.  Giving the apprentice a smile, he tried to figure out what name Icestar might gift her.  What would he have to call her from here on out?

If Cloverpaw held in most of her emotions, Marbledpaw was what most would define a <em>wreck.</em> Desperately dragging herself out of pits of hell everytime she woke up, lack of sleep, ruffled fur, panicked stare, and nightmares- the ceremony was a relief, maybe a drench in cold water to wash herself out of the repeated cycle she had been going through.

Rooksnap&#39;s name was mentioned and her ears flattened, unsure to whether be upset or furious or.. both. So instead she attempted to squirm backwards only for her name to be called and a pathway separate for her to walk forwards.

<em>Do you?</em> If she had refused here and there, her nanny&#39;s sacrifice would have been in vain- no, that couldn&#39;t, it wouldn&#39;t happen, she would ensure it. Cost of her life... maybe after everything that had happened it would hold a new meaning; her gaze glanced backwards to the expectant gazes of her clanmates, and realized that maybe they did need a new warrior in their ranks for hope.

<strong>&quot;Yes- I do,&quot;</strong> the words were a little rushed and voice cracked as if she hadn&#39;t spoken in days, but steeled with newfound iron, chest lifting, eyes fixing determinedly on the sky above instead of directly at Icestar, trying to search if the beginnings of stars were already showing despite the sun.</span>

The crack of the apprentice’s voice was one that was injured by grief and distress. Icestar felt her jaws tighten in response. Initiating this ceremony during a crisis was a bold move. One might think it was a slap in the face to pretend everything was alright amidst the chaos. However, it was a useful tactic to encourage her Clanmates to draw their courage and determination. They needed them now more than ever and Icestar wished to remind them of that.

<strong>” “Then by the powers of StarClan, I give you your warrior name. Marbledpaw from this moment you will be known as Marbledskies. StarClan honours your cleverness and diligence, and we welcome you as a full warrior of ThunderClan.”</strong>

Leaning forward, Icestar rested her white muzzle upon the newly-proclaimed warrior’s forehead, soaking in the warmth of Marbledskies’ scent.

This day would be the start of a brand new spark of hope among the populace, even with so much destruction and the death and disappearance of beloved clanmates, Laurelblaze understood that they could not wallow in misery. They had to find joy in the moments wherever they could. This day would mark the start of their recovery, the celebration of the elevation of an apprentice into a warrior, <em>Marbledskies.</em> The deputy nodded firmly and begun the celebratory chant for the newly-dubbed warrior, trying to kill the solemn mood by desperate celebration. They <em>needed</em> it. <strong>”Marbledskies! Marbledskies! Marbledskies!”</strong></span>

She had been watching the ceremony from a darkening sky, where stars finally began to show through the pastel citrus. After moons of anger and tension, the dead nanny had found peace.

In the form of a cold yet comforting breeze, she brushed past each of her gathered kits in turn, reaching Marbledskies last. Though she couldn&#39;t see or hear her, the familiar milk scent of the munchkin wreathed around the new warrior. The message was clear.

<em>I&#39;m proud of you. And I forgive you.</em> Would Marbledskies forgive her too?

A stronger wind shook the tops of the trees now, behind them the thin clouds creating a beautiful mixed pattern on their colorful backdrop. Somewhere in another realm, Rooksnap cheered the new name of her kit. <em>&#39;Marbledskies! Marbledskies!&#39;</em></span>

For a moment, the stone cold expression on the slender she-cat&#39;s face faltered. It was Marbledpaw&#39;s ceremony. She wasn&#39;t upset, truthfully.. she was supposed to remain strong, but seeing the previously bitter light-colored calcio in such a state actually made her feel some sort of sympathy. Even though she herself was just a bit younger than Marbledpaw, the two had always had their complicated relationship that started when they were no more than a few mousetails tall. She was becoming a warrior now. 

Although she couldn&#39;t even hardly bare to cheer, Cloverpaw had to feel pride - as she wanted Marbledskies to feel proud in this moment. It was part of a healing process.. she guessed. With the sorest of throats the younger she-cat gazed at, well.. she supposed they were sisters of some kind.. ironically to be the only &quot;sister&quot; Clover would ever know. Hearing the chants reach the air, she also happened to notice how she longed for her own ceremony.. even though she had claimed to hate every clan tradition there was. One thing was certain. There was a <em>congratulations</em> written all over her face.</span>

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

<em>Marbledskies.</em>  The name was far more beautiful than he might have expected during such a trying time, and for a moment the ceremonies made his own heart skip a beat in excitement, feeling the same joy that he did with previous meetings such as this one.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Marbledskies!  Marbledskies!&quot;</em></strong></em> He called out, his voice only one in the mixture of dozens as the clan cheered for the emotional fem.  The name rolled off of his tounge with ease, and his happiness for the new warrior wavered only when he felt a small breeze.  

              Usually it would have meant little to nothing to him, but it seemed... Odd, as if it weren&#39;t the average stream of wind.  Glancing over, he tried to see if anybody else had felt it.  The majority of the cats seemed to have not felt it, unless it had just gone unnoticed.  As he sent a quick glance around at the faces surrounding him, the majority not seeming all too well, he caught sight of Cloverpaw.  His thoughts seemed to align with hers as he wondered what her ceremony might be like and when it would happen, along with Blazepaw&#39;s, for just a moment before he focused again on the new recruit to the rank of their warriors.  The gentle breeze stuck in the back of his mind as he put all of his focus on Marbledpaw- no, Marbled<em>skies</em>, now.  He tried not to focus on the illness that had plagued the camp, nor the injuries.  Icestar wasn&#39;t the only one with injured paw pads, and he wasn&#39;t quite sure if he was capable of fixing everything that had happened.  Instead, he tried to focus on the she-cat gaining a new title, and that she-cat alone.

It warmed her heart watching Marbledskies’ eyes light up. The chanting of the Clan rang right up to StarClan. There was no doubt. If this wasn’t a morale booster, the lynx-point didn’t know what else could be. 

Icestar remaining on the Highledge was an obvious sign that there was more to this meeting than ceremonies. She waited patiently as the cheers subsided, leaving behind a gentle glow of joy.

<strong>” As I have mentioned before, Fernpaw has disappeared. Hence, ThunderClan is missing its sole medicine cat.”</strong> With no apprentice to take her place, the Clan was in a dire situation. Or would be if that had been the case… 

<strong>” However, Laurelblaze has discovered marigold petals unusually placed by the medicine den and to our interpretation, it is StarClan’s way of showing us that they wish to encourage a particular cat to take this position.”</strong> 

She paused, letting the words sink into each and every being. Slowly and with great care, Icestar looked over to the tuxedo tom with intricate daisy yellow hues. 

<strong>” Marigolddust, would you like to take on the role of ThunderClan’s new medicine cat?”</strong>

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Words that he had already heard once before still sounded foreign to him as they were repeated, his own ceremony of sorts following close being Marbledskies&#39;.  He might have guessed that his chosen rank would solely be announced today, not asked of him, but perhaps it was good to have a second chance to go back.  Although he couldn&#39;t see this situation as a choice to turn around and go back to being a warrior, it seemed like it easily could have been meant that way.  He took a moment to think over the question.  Yes, it had been answered already just a day or two ago, but he thought it would be more respectful and conclusive to give it a second thought.  He was committing himself to a life of healing if he were to say yes, and now that he has truly gotten a chance to take in all of the problems that the clan was having medical wise, he felt more than intimidated.  Fear was something he felt often, but he had never quite felt fear like this.  But that was all that held him for the few seconds.  He had already said yes to the question once before, and it would be rude and terrible to say no to it now.  Sure, he had yet to truly figure out how he will move on from here, but he could do it nonetheless, with enough time.</span>

              Getting onto his paws, he looked up at Icestar and tried not to focus on everyone else.  This was far more awkward now that the factor of the whole clan was added, but he felt it wouldn&#39;t be enough to say the two words that would finalize this turning point for him sitting down.  With his ears going a little flatter on his head as he felt apprehension push them down, he gave a small nod.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I will,&quot;</em></strong></em> he finally said, wincing a little at the idea of what the others there would think.  Would they view him as worthy enough?  Did they see how terribly he could fail, just as he did?  All he could do was hope they didn&#39;t.  Maybe they even wished Fernpaw was still there.  No, of course they did.  Fernpaw deserved to be just as greived over as every other cat in the forest.   He couldn&#39;t be the only one who would surely find himself letting some tears fall as he lay in his nest at night, letting the grief truly settle in.  <em>Way to turn such a good situation sad, Marigolddust.</em> He thought quietly, feeling sheepish for his own thoughts.

The silence that fell before them was enough to cause Icestar’s dark ears to prick with interest. Was Marigolddust reconsidering his new position? The masked leader remained still, not even the usual twitching of her tail tip disturbed the wind. Marigolddust wasn’t one to dishonour his own words.

They <em>were</em> going to get out of this just like they always did. While the progress was slow, the fruit of their labour was nearing and all it took was to keep at it until they could reach out and grab it.

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

The moon pool was another important factor of this new role that he had in the clan that he had, somehow, forgotten.  It was odd, how easy it was to forget what you might be signing up for at a time with as much excitement as becoming a medicine cat.  Marigolddust nearly shivered at the idea, perhaps out of fear, but also possibly because of excitement.  He had never been to the pool before, and he didn&#39;t feel worthy enough to go to the legendary waters.  What if it really wasn&#39;t a sign from Starclan, the marigold petals?  What if he went to the moon pool and received nothing, unable to sink into the deep sleep that all star-chosen high ranks did?  Would he end up there, awake in the small cavern while Icestar slept?  What would she and Laurelblaze think if he turned out to really <em>not</em> be destined for the job?  Soon, the excitement that may have lied behind his shiver dispersed, overtaken by fear and apprehension.  So many things could go wrong, yet he wouldn&#39;t be able to know what will and what won&#39;t.  Trying to ignore the doubts and realities running through his head, he gave a small smile to his leader and a soft nod of agreement.  He would be going to the moon pool with the silver point, and that might have been the only thing he knew if he hadn&#39;t caught a glimpse of stars that seemed a bit out of place.  

             Turning his attention onto the early coming stars, Marigolddust froze as he took in the sight.  The stars looked like a cat he knew all too well... But that couldn&#39;t be, could it?  No, he must have been seeing things.  Worry must have finally made him hallucinate.  But, imaginary or not, Marigolddust couldn&#39;t bring himself to move a muscle.  He could just stare at the familiar form, meeting eyes he knew better than his own mother&#39;s.</span>

               A new type of sadness settled on his heart as he took a longer look, although it was cut short as Rooksnap nodded her last farewell, fading away into the background of other cats as if she had only been mist.  He blinked, disappointment and confusion striking him as he searched for his nanny in all of the faces around him, but she was gone.  His search slowed until it was nothing, only him looking at the place where the Starclanner had been only moments before.  His imagination... Yes, that must have been it.  But, despite his bewildered doubt, he felt as if something had become finalized with the small gesture.  He found himself feeling a bit more confident now.  Maybe the Moonpool wouldn&#39;t be all that bad, and perhaps visiting there could make it so that this wasn&#39;t the last time he saw that smile.

Truly, this day was going to mark a new era in ThunderClan, the title of medicine cat has been passed to a new holder officially. Marigolddust was Fernpaw’s successor, and he had not only the eyes of his clanmates trained upon him, but those of their warrior ancestors as well. She prayed for his and Icestar’s safety for when they eventually made the trek to the Moonpool in order for him to be officially recognized by StarClan as ThunderClan’s medicine cat. Goodness knows what potentially lied out there, but she had faith they would return to the clan safely when the time came. For now, he’d be a medicine cat in name only until the pair could make the journey to the Moonpool. <em>He’s gonna be great, I believe in him!</em>

The deputy couldn’t contain her joy as she began the chanting again, <strong>”Marigolddust! Marigolddust!”</strong> the cries filled the air, and she hoped she was chanting so loud that StarClan could hear her, that they knew that Marigolddust was their new medicine cat, and that they were going to accept that no matter what!</span>

<em><strong><em>- Close Future -</em></strong></em>

A smile spread across his grey features as Wolfprowl accepted Marigolddust&#39;s suggestion.  The little bit of irritation that his brother expressed might have made the moment more sweet, showing Marigolddust that he had managed to convince even Wolfprowl to take are of himself.  Maybe he wouldn&#39;t be all that bad at this, after all, if he kept this up.  That was, besides the fact that he hardly knew any more herbs than poppyseed, marigold, cobwebs, and chamomile.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Something small.. I can do that,&quot;</em></strong></em> he agreed, looking over towards the prey pile.  Anything small?  Well, it was a good thing that there were some small birds, and maybe some small squirrels, too, although their tails had a bit too much fur to make them all that satisfying to eat.  A finch could work, couldn&#39;t it?  The prey was small, with a thinner layer of feathers instead a thick coat of fur.  It was also decently tasty, and perhaps he would even take a feather or two for his nest.  He was about to set off to get the small meal when his brother spoke again, distracting him from the small mission.  Pausing, Marigolddust glanced back at the other grey tom.   <em><strong><em>&quot;I-- I&#39;m.. fine, don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, before softly adding, &quot;I&#39;m not puking my guts out nearly as much as any of you.&quot;****  He turned his back on Wolfprowl once again, hoping to leave the topic behind as he took off for the short trip to the prey pile.</span>

                          There was indeed a finch that he found in the pile, although it&#39;s feathers were brown, more like the common finch rather than the sunny colors of the goldfinch.  Deciding it would be best not too be too much more picky than he already was being, he lowered his head and nudged the morsel of prey, turning it as he examined it&#39;s exterior.  The small animal seemed to have been fine when it still had life behind it&#39;s eyes, and still seemed just as fine now, besides perhaps a little bit of mud.  Pensive, he picked the finch up carefully before bringing it back to his and Wolfprowl&#39;s resting place.  <em><strong><em>&quot;How&#39;s this?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, setting it in front of his brother for his judgment.

Tigerpaw only shook her head slightly. <strong>&quot;Nn-mm...&quot;</strong> There were so many feelings in her heart that she didn&#39;t know how to put to words. Even if she could, she wasn&#39;t sure it&#39;d help anything. Silent tears began to streak down her striped cheeks.

The apprentice stumbled up to her mentor and collapsed into the torbie&#39;s thick chest fur instead, crying softly in the fluff. It was simple: she was heartbroken. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

She hadn’t expected a response like this from her apprentice, but considering her personality and how earnest she was in almost everything she did, she probably should have. Of course that behavior would extend into her sadness, especially with something like this. No one liked having their heart broken by someone they cared for, it was never a cake walk. It took time to heal from the initial blow, but all Laurelblaze hoped was that her pupil would chin up soon. This was definitely concerning for her, as she couldn’t train or work when she was holding back tears. <em>Gotta let her let it all out, she’s definitely in a lot of pain right now.</em>

Laurelblaze relaxed her stance a bit as she let her apprentice use her fur as a comfort zone, it wasn’t the first time someone came to her to act as a shoulder to cry on. The deputy wanted to be there for her clanmates, especially her apprentices. They needed to trust her, she <em>wanted</em> them to trust her. <strong>”Its okay, Tigerpaw, you’ll get through this. Its not the end of the world.”</strong> a bit of an understatement, but Laurelblaze really didn’t understand why the apprentices were so eager to hop into relationships, these things took time— but she was speaking from personal experience of course, it took a long time before she and Hollyfrost decided to confess to one another. Too long in her eyes, she adored her.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tigerpaw and Juniperpaw had been deeply infatuated with each other, and even though she was beginning to gain some perspective from it, the lesson was a hard one to learn. <em>He saved my life...</em> but she couldn&#39;t explain that guilt to Laurelblaze, after lying that it had been her idea to leave to protect his reputation. Now they couldn&#39;t even be together if they wanted to, and while Tigerpaw was heartbroken, she found herself avoiding him whenever they crossed paths.

Could she still care for him as a clanmate without hurting her feelings more? Getting over this seemed so far away. For now the young tabby was deep in sadness, whatever energy she did have being poured into her duties. She could only hope that something good would come out of all this. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

In a way, life couldn’t be a fairytale where two people who meet immediately fell in love. It was unrealistic, and Tigerpaw had learned that lesson relatively early on. Not every relationship worked out, and that extended to all kinds of them. Friendships sometimes drifted apart, betrayals occurred, and even sometimes two cats met at the wrong time in life. The world could be cruel, but that didn’t diminish the amount of joy that could be found in it once it was discovered. She had faith her apprentice would one day discover that for herself, and recover finally.

 <strong>”You know, I never really spent my time focusing on that sort of thing when I was your age honestly, I think I scared the other apprentices. I always wanted to brawl with them, so imagine how that worked out for me.”</strong> her lips curled up into an amused smirk, and she couldn’t help but to let out a chuckle. She had a point behind her words, she wasn’t spouting empty nonsense at her to make her feel better. <strong>”But there were a few cats who did let me into their lives, they saw past that, and even if some have moved on from my life, I haven’t forgotten about them. Even if it hurts, one day you’ll look back and enjoy the time you did get to spend in each other’s lives. The happiness it brought, and you’ll experience it again, and hopefully it does last.”</strong> the deputy let out a small sigh, before she shot an oddly, deathly serious glare down to the young molly. <strong>”But not anytime soon, you’re focusing on your training until the day you get your warrior name, missy. I still haven’t forgotten.”</strong>

The trek across Thunderclan territory had been more than easy, his russet paws seeming to almost glide across the terrain with ease. His eyes and ears had done the most work, constantly searching the area for the slightest thing that could mean potential danger for the tom and his companion. He spared a word or two with Skyclan&#39;s medicine cat, once or twice as to break the silence, yet his main focus rested on the journey ahead. And yet, before long they had arrived. Safely, as predicted.
    Cardinalspark led the way through the camp&#39;s entrance, his ears twitching as he inhaled deeply. It was quite nice to be able to come and go as he pleased again, though there was still quite a lot to be done. Currently, they needed Beanspark to help aid Marigolddust in his new life as Thunderclan&#39;s medicine cat. With a toss of his head, the russet feline urged the tortoiseshell forward. <strong>&#39;Well, we have arrived. I&#39;m pretty sure if he&#39;s not in camp anywhere, he&#39;d be in the medicine cat den.&quot;</strong> he said after a moment, casting a glance about the camp for the tuxedo tom.

Beanspark silently followed Cardinalspark, the lone warrior he managed to catch on the border. Beanspark&#39;s eyes remained  on the ground before him, his mind filled with murky water. 
Sure, he was now a fully fledged medicine cat. Everything he had been working towards was starting to pay off. But...

Hemlockpaw stayed on the edge of his mind. Every time he walked through camp he always swore he could see his mate standing there. 

Beanspark needed a break from camp, desperately. He assumed that Specklerose could sense this somehow, as she sent him to train with Marigolddust. 

Beanspark shook his head free of the dirt as they entered ThunderClan camp. He had never entered another clan&#39;s camp, minus WindClan. <strong>&quot;Oh wow! ThunderClan is quite beautiful this time of year.&quot;</strong> The oak trees were littered with orange and brown, as leaffall had begun. Even with the landslides damage, it still looked so peaceful. <strong>&quot;I really appreciate the escort, Cardinalspark. I&#39;ll find him.&quot;</strong> Beanspark bowed his head as if to excuse him, then turned around to look for the esteemed Marigolddust.

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Cardinalspark was right; although the grey tux was nowhere to be found in the camp, he was in fact nearby, trying to sort through things in his new den.  It was an absolute disaster, and all that was there were the few, most basic herbs, and he was even low on those, despite how long he spent trying to collect everything he recalled being a healing plant, rather than the average greenery.  The painted wall was, fortunately, still intact, although it was a little muddy and dusty even after he had dug away the debris that had lied infront of it.  The paintings on it were beautiful, although what they meant, Marigolddust wasn&#39;t sure.  <em>If only Fernpaw was here to explain it all to me,</em> he thought, yellow gaze blurring at the sadness that was lifted from the thought.  If only he could go back, go back to a time when everything was alright, at least on the surface.  Even though that time was not even a moon ago.  Maybe then he could make sure to spend as much time as possible with Fernpaw, to learn all he could and perhaps even warn her, if he was able to.  Maybe he could have prevented this whole landslide, if he hadn&#39;t been so oblivious, even if everybody else was as unaware as him.  

             Large ears perked as voices joined his ears, one faintly familiar while the other was completely foreign.  Usually he would have been uneffected by something like that, since he was so bad with remembering the names and stories of those who even shared his same clan, but a scent accompanied his nose that caught him off guard, dragging him out of his thoughts.  Straightening, Marigolddust recognized the scent that he was warned might be the hardest to remember as a kit.  Or was it the easiest?  It already seemed so long ago that he was still on talking terms with Rooksnap, and now they wouldn&#39;t return to such domain.</span>

           Biting his lip, the tom tried to push away all of the thoughts.  Now wasn&#39;t the time for things like this, not with who had come to visit.  Marigolddust knew, of course, about Beanspark coming to help him with his new rank, and immediately felt nervous as he heard the unfamiliar voice.  Quickly stepping on his tail to distract him from everything going through his head, he prepared to meet the other young tom.  Finding temporary peace in the deep waters of his thoughts, he turned and reluctantly exited the den.  Near the center of the camp, he spotted the two other toms, becoming more apprehensive as his lemony hues landed on a specific tortoiseshell.  He had managed to inch close enough to hear Beanspark&#39;s comment on the camp, along with his next words.  

              Stepping forwards, Marigolddust hesitantly spoke up.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh, um- no need for that,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, his tone quiet but his words quick as he approached the two shyly.  This was the first time that he had met a cat from another clan in his own territory, and it was quite nerve-racking, to say the least, especially when the other was searching for him.   After a moment of pause, the new medic realized he didn&#39;t introduce himself.  Was he supposed to?  Beanspark clearly knew who he was, although Marigolddust had never actually interacted with the tom.  Maybe he should mention that he was who the Skyclanner was looking for, on case he had expected something different.  <em><strong><em>&quot;O-oh, I&#39;m Marigolddust, by the way,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, almost cringing at the awkward tone in his voice as his nerves got the best of him, making him trip over his own words.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;m... Glad that someone can still see this as pretty.  It looks much better than it did before.&quot;</em></strong></em> Marigolddust said, his words finally more stable as he gazed around at the camp.</span>

 Maybe it was the fact that he had spent moons living in a place that looked just as this did now, rather than rocky terrain, that made it so he wasn&#39;t able to see much beauty in his surroundings.  Mainly, there was only misfortune and ruin, despite the fact that it had been fixed up quite a bit.

Fortunately for Beanspark, Marigolddust found them relatively quickly as if right on cue. The russet warrior spared a glance over the two toms, before nodding after a moment. <strong>&quot;Well, seems like no one will need to do any scouting for each other. I&#39;ll leave you two to it.&quot;</strong> he then waved his tail as he turned to leave the two medicine cats to themselves and prepare to begin with training.

Finally, things seemed to be looking better. Even if it was simply in the slightest. The rosetted feline could hardly imagine the camp any better than its destroyed state, but surely enough - that day had finally come and cats were able to come and go as they pleased. Mistypaw hadn&#39;t truly been affected by the blockage, managing to make her way through the small entrance thanks to her size. Yet it had been tiring being among the only ones able to gather prey for their clanmates. If this would be what warriorhood would be like, she wanted no part in it. Such would be...much too tiring.
    Even so, as she laid sprawled out in camp; she was no where near exhaustion. She&#39;d had a few days rest since the entrances had been cleared and now, she desired nothing more than to do something of some sort. It was a moment of conflict however, as she wasn&#39;t the type to actively seek out chores nor duties of any kind. Besides, though the itch to move was nearly unbearable, she couldn&#39;t bother to move.
    Sometimes, life was simply uncooperative. With a heavy breath, the rosette managed to flop onto her side. Blinking, the young molly scanned the camp about her, whiskers twitching as her tail lashed in an irritable manner.

Beanspark shied away on instinct as the new cat approached. He was slightly more on edge than he realized, being so far away from home. <strong>&quot;O-oh...&quot;</strong> Beanspark managed to stutter out, quickly whipping his tail as if to shoo away his anxiety. 

Then, realization hit him. <strong>&quot;Oooooh! Hello, Marigolddust. I&#39;m Beanspark, of SkyClan. It&#39;s so nice to finally meet you.&quot;</strong> His worry and confusion rolled away, quickly replaced with a welcoming warmth. 

Seeing the new medicine cat, however, stirred some memories in him. They hurt, a lot, but he tried to stuff them down. <em>She&#39;s not here anymore, and you have a job to do.</em> 

<strong>&quot;Ive...actually been here before. I visited Fernpaw once as an apprentice.&quot;</strong> He bit back his grief as he continued, <strong>&quot;No hardships can shake ThunderClans beauty.&quot;</strong>

Then to be told her no longer existent relationship with Juniperpaw might one day make her happy again only made her heart squeeze with more pain. All she could feel right now was grief, for losing him and especially for losing Laurelblaze&#39;s trust.

She winced. <strong>&quot;I know...&quot;</strong> came the quiet sigh. By the way Laurelblaze talked, it seemed like her ceremony was seasons away. <strong>&quot;I&#39;ll work really hard, I promise.&quot;</strong> She wanted the torbie&#39;s approval more than anything. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

Wolfprowl only sniffed sourly in response, crossing his paws in wait. <strong>&quot;I wasn&#39;t &#39;puking my guts out&#39;..&quot;</strong> he grumbled.

He rekindled his averted eyes onto the finch. Small, fresh. It earned a stiff nod from the warrior; the gesture closest to him showing approval. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Marigolddust sent Cardinalspark a thankful look as the tom turned and walked away, although guilt and doubt from the fact that he couldn&#39;t recall the warrior&#39;s name held back the words of gratitude that were on the tip of his tongue.  Now, it was only Beanspark and him... He hoped he wouldn&#39;t mess this up too badly or give off too poor of an impression.  It was already an embarrassment, the fact that he knew so little about herbs, but how would it feel to display such a weakness Infront of a cat who had spent his whole apprenticeship studying and mastering the topic?  Tearing his eyes off of Cardinalfall&#39;s leaving form, Marigolddust focused on Beanspark again.  Sure, the Skyclan Medicine cat was a bit shorter than him, but he was just as worry-inducing as Laurelblaze, if not more.  It was only the warm smile the tom offered that calmed Marigolddust&#39;s doubt, if only the littlest bit.  Beanspark didn&#39;t seem like a cat who would be too quick to judge another, and he must know the difficulties of learning herbs too, mustn&#39;t he?  Beanspark might have to take it easy on him, even if Marigolddust wanted to learn all he could as fast as he could.  He had so, <em>so</em> many cat&#39;s to heal... It was too overwhelming to be unable to do anything, even if he couldn&#39;t be blamed for it.  

               <em><strong><em>&quot;You too, Beanspark, thanks for visiting.  I.. don&#39;t exactly have the *largest</em> supply of herbs, but I&#39;m hoping what we have might be enough for a little lesson,&quot;*</strong></em> Marigolddust said softly, a bit of a sheepish smile crossing his features.  <em>Beanspark.</em>  One name among quite a few that he would have to memorize, not that memorizing his clanmates&#39; names weren&#39;t just as important as the other healer&#39;s.  He had to work on it as a whole, and who knew, maybe he would become a master at it like Laurelblaze.</span>

               The young, stormy toned medic&#39;s eyes widened slightly at Beanspark&#39;s last words.  <em><strong><em>&quot;O-oh, I&#39;m... Sorry.  About the fact that she&#39;s...&quot;</em></strong></em> He started, before trailing off and continuing shortly after, <em><strong><em>&quot;She&#39;s not here anymore.&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, finally finishing the thought as he voiced the bitterly painful words.  If he could have, Marigolddust would have made sure he was far from the fresh position he was given now, both because it would mean Fernpaw was still around and because hd didn&#39;t quite feel like this was the part he was supposed to play.  How could a warrior become a medicine cat and do the job as well as every cat before them?  He would have thought differently on the idea if he had known Honeysong just yet, but that wasn&#39;t the case, and he wasn&#39;t the most confident about it.

It wasn’t a matter of <em>not</em> wanting to be loved, back then she was just not focused on chasing after cats she was fawning over… Mostly because she hadn’t been fawning over anyone back then. Even when she was Tigerpaw’s age she was a workaholic, obsessed with the idea that one day she’d be leading the clan. She always had big aspirations, wanting to take on the world with her head held high. Hence why she thought she had to constantly  work to prove herself back then.

<strong>”I believe in you, but please don’t go running off again. I’ve already lost one apprentice before they got their warrior name, I don’t want to lose you too.”</strong> truly it was her biggest fear with her apprentices, she saw herself as her apprentice’s caretaker, taking responsibility over them. She had to make sure they made it to warriorhood, but doing something reckless like this jeopardized that. Not only that, but she thought she was going to lose her mind by the amount of anxious thoughts running through her head.

<strong>”We still have more work to do, but we’ll resume training as soon as the entrances are no longer blocked. I can’t exactly train you properly in a ruined camp.”</strong> she flashed a reassuring smile towards her apprentice, her tail swaying a bit as she then turned back to the wall of dirt that was almost mocking the pair of them. <strong>”So let’s tear this thing down so we can do that, right?”</strong>

The past several days had been excruciating for the lynx-point who was so used to being out in the forest for most of the day. Being trapped in camp had brought forth unpleasant memories that she wished had remained forgotten in the deepest recesses of her mind. Alas, that was not the case and thus had busied herself with tasks all day long for the sake of the Clan and her own mental state.

The open entrances were a huge relief. With the Clan beginning to run in its normal course, Icestar felt more relaxed and optimistic that their situation will become resolved.

Excitement prickled the dark pads of her paws as she strode towards the thorn tunnel. It had been too long… The stone walls were beginning to become ominous. 

Glancing back towards the Highledge was a mistake. The inner glee drained from her rapidly. Icestar froze, watching the faint outline of a light brown tabby looking down at her harshly. All it took was a tight squeeze of her eyes and when they opened once more, it was gone. Icestar shook her head desperately.

Beanspark’s arrival presented hope to be as powerful as she had claimed during the meeting. Unfortunately, Marigolddust had minimal experience in his new duties and healing his tired and injured Clanmates would prove to be a challenging first task. Hopefully, the SkyClan medicine cat would be willingly to aid and teach the young tom a few tricks to getting Icestar’s warriors back on their paws.

The silver-masked molly wandered the campgrounds in search of the feline, wishing to speak with him. While Icestar wished to thank him, she needed to determine his intentions. Beanspark was a fairly new healer and she wanted to get to know him more: to see what type of heart he contained. 

<em>Where could he be?</em> A scowl etched across her masked features as she weaved through a group of kits dashing across the clearing.

<strong>&quot;Don&#39;t cause too much trouble!&quot;</strong> Beanspark purred warmly, just a few tail lengths behind the dashing kits. He had given them a quick check up as an example to Marigolddust, who was dealing with the last kit on his own. 

Beanspark was confident he would do well, even if he was uncertain. ThunderClan was in good paws. 

Before he could turn back, though, he noticed ThunderClans leader scowling as the kits nearly trampled her, suppressing a giggle. <strong>&quot;Oh StarClan...kits.&quot;</strong> He purred, approaching her. <strong>&quot;Sorry about that Icestar. They&#39;re a bit rowdy after being cooped up for a few seconds.&quot;</strong> 

Beanspark noticed the somewhat determined look in her gaze; she was on her way to do...<em>something.</em> 

<strong>&quot;Did you need something?&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;That&#39;s alright! We&#39;ll figure it out. At the very least, I can always take you herb hunting.&quot;</strong> Beanspark swished his tail in excitement. <strong>&quot;Oughtta be interesting in a different territory.&quot;</strong> 

Beanspark frowned as Marigolddust continued, feeling the bitter hurt that the fresh medicine cat expressed. <strong>&quot;No, it&#39;s okay. Life happens. We just have to live out the rest of ours.&quot;</strong> Beanspark placed a reassuring tail on the taller toms shoulders. <s>Well...it was more like his midback. Beanspark is short.</s> <strong>&quot;Try not to think of yourself as a replacement, because you&#39;re not. You&#39;re your own medicine cat, separate from her. And you&#39;re doing just fine.&quot;</strong> Beanspark reassured him, feeling a pang of sympathy for him. When he first became an apprentice, he was so worried about the large paws he had to fill. Specklerose is an amazing medicine cat, how could he ever replace her? However, she fostered in him his individuality, making him his own medicine cat. Beanspark was lucky though, he thought, as his mentor hadn&#39;t run off. 

<strong>&quot;Let&#39;s see your herb storage, ya?&quot;</strong>

As time continued onward, the rosetted feline had hardly moved an inch. She merely watched the going-ons in camp, various warriors tending to different duties; a helpful apprentice or two occasionally spotted alongside them. There wasn&#39;t much going on currently, which irritated the young feline. Forcing herself into an upright position, she gazed about her surroundings. Rising to her paws, she decided there was only one option. Resort to old tactics.
    Whipping around, Mistypaw padded away from her spot; her pace brisk retaining an even stride. Her eyes darted over those about her, mentally checking off each one that she passed. <em>No, not that one. Not that one either.</em>  A moment or two passed of this, before her odd-colored gaze landed on an unmistakable figure. Icestar. Perfect.
    Bounding over to the molly, her whiskers twitched as she reached the lynx-point&#39;s side. <strong>&quot;Hey, Icestar. How&#39;s living? Everything the same as before?&quot;</strong> she inquired, referring to the unfortunate event the entire clan had witnessed concerning Thunderclan&#39;s leader. <strong>&quot;You don&#39;t seem too well to me honestly. Perhaps you ought to see the medicine cat.&quot;</strong> she added, noticing that Icestar seemed...a little off this morning.

As if he was summoned from thin air, Beanspark appeared before her. Her fleeting gaze travelled from the mischievous kits back to SkyClan’s medicine cat. The furrowed expression upon her face relaxed. <strong>” Rowdy kits are a good thing,”</strong> Icestar remarked affectionately. If they were up to no good, it meant they had the energy to do it. To the lynx-point, it meant the Clan was doing well if the kits were healthy.

<strong>” I was just looking for you,”</strong> she explained. <strong>” I don’t think we’ve ever introduced ourselves and I wanted to get to know you.”</strong> Honest and blunt as always. Of course, there were limits to her truthful nature. Icestar kept her raw paw pads firmly upon the ground to hide the cracks that split through the leathery layer harshly. 

<strong>” I’m Icestar,”</strong> she began, dipping her head. She had a feeling Beanspark was quite aware of her identity but she felt it was still the proper thing to do.

<em><strong><em>- Close Past -</em></strong></em>

A certain thought had been plaguing Marigolddust&#39;s mind ever since the ceremony, the only real company he had as he waited for Icestar at the entrance of the camp.  <em>This is the day.</em>  But, then again, that very thought had passed through his mind so many times over the past few days that he wasn&#39;t sure it had much impact anymore.  He had thought it just at the beginning of the day, too.  Why couldn&#39;t he get the words out of his head?  Of course this was the day.  By now, it would probably be more accurate to think of the whole moon as being &#39;the moon&#39;.  There were so many stages to entering this new rank of his, and he didn&#39;t understand how much more he had to go through.  First, there was the original question asked to him from Icestar and Laurelblaze in private.  At first, he had been convinced that that was all he had to do, although he should have known that was a mouse-brained way of thinking.  He hadn&#39;t been accepted by Starclan yet, despite their prophecy pointing fingers at him, and today was when he would finally see the star-washed cats.  The idea of going to sleep and waking up in a dream surrounded by cats who had passed on was quite nerve-racking, especially since it would be his first time.  <em>As long as Icestar&#39;s there, I&#39;ll be fine,</em> he reminded himself, finding more comfort in that fact than in anything else.  By now it was hard not to trust Icestar.  He felt much closer to her than he had when they had first truly spoken, and not only because she had saved his life during the landslide, even though guilt ebbed at him every time he recalled the event.</span>

               Now, standing uncomfortably at the reopened entrance to the camp, Marigolddust glanced around for the silver point.  He had received quite a few congratulations from clanmates, and because of this he had grown unsure whether a cat approaching him would be Icestar or a clanmate, even with how late it had become.  It was far from the brightest out of the day, and the lack of the often abundant sunlight made him even more uneased.  He had been asked to wait for the leader, and so he was.  He wondered whether she was checking on her kits, unless they had become apprentices already.  Why was it that he couldn&#39;t remember if they were still as small as the last time he had seen them?  Perhaps it was because he hardly knew their names, although he sometimes wished he did.  She might have also been dealing with any problems that some cats might have approached her about, such as where Fernpaw was or why Marigolddust, of all cats, had been chosen to take her spot.  No, probably not... <em>hopefully</em> not.  It was hard not to doubt that others viewed this change negatively, even he wished it wasn&#39;t.  Gently brushing his tail against the still fairly muddy grass at his feet, he continued to think over what might happen that night, or how it would happen.  Hopefully this would all be as easy as going to visit a friend in the nursery... even though he still had some troubles with that, too.

<em><strong>* - Present - *</strong></em>

<em>Herb hunting?</em>  A spark of interest went through Marigolddust&#39;s gaze at the idea.  Herb hunting... maybe if they did that he would be able to learn more herbs in the process?  It would also increase how many herbs they had and the variety of the plants, making it so that training and healing would be easier than it would be otherwise.  Compared to Marigolddust, Beanspark was a bit of a master of the art of healing, and the thought of becoming just as good or becoming better for the clan made his heart skip a beat.  He never thought about what it would be like once he actually got the hang of all of this.  He was still in the midst of the change, at least emotionally, and because of this, he hadn&#39;t thought much about the future.  At least, not much that was very positive.  <em><strong><em>&quot;A different territory?  Aren&#39;t I not allowed to cross borders-?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked, a bit taken by surprise at the tortoiseshell&#39;s words.  He wasn&#39;t quite used to the idea of having looser rules, and it was more than likely that he would keep to as many of the restrictions he had as a warrior, even now that he didn&#39;t exactly have to follow them.  It would most definitely feel wrong, taking even the smallest step onto the territory of another clan.  Unless the tom had meant the KLR forest?  Surely that would be just as dangerous, if not more.  

              At the feeling of Beanspark&#39;s tail, Marigolddust relaxed a little bit.  The feeling was familiar, even if the only cat who had ever given him such a reassuring gesture was the she-cat who occupied both of the toms&#39; minds.  Perhaps Rooksnap had done so once or twice, too, although it must had been awhile since she had.  Otherwise, he doubted he would have forgotten.  Beanspark wasn&#39;t much taller than Fernpaw, which made the feeling only all too familiar.</span>

              Although he could feel his eyes about to water, a small smile touched his muzzle as he adverted his gaze lower, facing his paws rather than the other medicine cat.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Thank you.. It&#39;s just a bit odd, doing her job so soon after her absense...&quot;</em></strong></em> he mumbled softly.  Beanspark&#39;s words truly did help the tux.  Somehow, it seemed that Beanspark had recognized and understood how Marigolddust was feeling, whether it was because Beanspark was familiar to the feeling or because Marigolddust was bad at hiding such emotions, he wasn&#39;t sure.  The mottled brown tom was easily better than Marigolddust when it came to covering up his feelings, which could both be seen as an advantage or a disadvantage.  Personally, Marigolddust would have been convinced it was positive.  

              The change of topics brought Marigolddust out of his thoughts, bringing his focus back to the more experienced medic.  Stiffening slightly, he quickly nodded.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh, yes, of course.  I&#39;m assuming you already know where the den is, but just incase, you can follow me.&quot;</em></strong></em> He suggested light-heartedly, before turning and padding quietly over to the entrance to his den.  Even the enterance wasn&#39;t just as it had before, still having some mud caked to the stone around it and having some gaps where stone that had fallen once stood, but the true damage was inside.  Besides what Marigolddust and some others had collected, all of the herb storage had been destroyed and buried.  The shelves that had once held the whole storage were fairly empty now, with only the bottom shelf partly populated by collected plants.</span>

            He had grown to understand where the basic categories of herbs were to be set, spending so many moons in the den to accompany Fernpaw, and so he had put all of the herbs that he knew on the lowest shelf.  Of course he only knew the basics, although there was one herb he wasn&#39;t sure was meant to be with the marigold and cobwebs.  He had managed to collect some chamomile, and had stored it with the rest of the herbs he had gathered.  Was it out of place?  Had he placed it correctly?  He had no idea, and therefore felt a little nervous when he showed the damaged display to Beanspark.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve managed to gather together,&quot;</em></strong></em> he explained, his tone a bit quiet as he examined the small mound of herbs.  It had turned out that the landslide didn&#39;t only effect the camp, but it effected the forest around it, flooding out what herbs had still survived the approaching season.

<em><strong><em>- Close Past -</em></strong></em>

A raise of a nonexistent brow was the response to the his brother&#39;s words, although Marigolddust decided he wouldn&#39;t make too much of an effort to try and object.  He knew that his statement might have been a bit of an exaggeration, but at the same time Marigolddust found himself unsure whether or not it really was a hyperbole.  It wasn&#39;t often that blood was mixed with the bile that a cat lost while retching, and the fact that the crimson substance had been present in his own kin&#39;s excretion was a bit of a worrying surprise.  <em>What could be causing it?</em> he thought, finding himself wondering over the question yet again.  It was one that he didn&#39;t know the answer to, and he doubted that anybody else in the camp knew any more than he did.  Had Wolfprowl really been puking his guts out?  Would there have been more blood?  Maybe the small bit of blood was only a warning for what was to come in the near future.  Stepping tenderly onto his own tail, he brought himself back to attention and away from the troubling thoughts.</span>

            As he displayed the chosen prey to his brother, Marigolddust couldn&#39;t help but take note of Wolfprowl&#39;s nod.  Although he wasn&#39;t exactly flattered by the gesture, knowing full well how most cats treated their siblings and how differently Woflprowl acted towards him, it was fairly satisfying.  Finally, he had earned something a bit more than disapproval from the tom.  Perhaps the progress he was making would make the fact that he had to work with the warrior less troublesome in the future, although he could only hope for such a thing.  Settling down next to his brother, Marigolddust patiently waited for his brother to take the first bite, or at least the first of whatever he cared to take.  As he waited, Marigolddust decided now would be a decent time to ask what he was meant to ask those he were to help.  <em><strong><em>&quot;How long have you been this sick?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked softly, hoping the process that he had made so far wouldn&#39;t be cast aside as he asked the question.  He needed to know information like this, incase he <em>did</em> learn something that could come to use.

Mistypaw’s immediate presence by her side sent the silvery-white femme’s fur sticking out in all angles. Her lean muscles gave a tight jolt of surprise. <em>How had she snuck up on me?</em> A bewildered look flickered in her ocean-coloured optics. Flicking her feathery tail back and forth, Icestar tilted her head to the side. At least it was helping her drive those unpleasant memories to the deepest depths of her heart.

Recovering quickly, Icestar returned Mistypaw’s greeting: <strong>” Hey!”</strong> She stepped to the side, allowing more space for the apprentice to come closer. <strong>” Living is pretty great,”</strong> Icestar replied. <strong>” Everything is the same.”</strong> Losing her multiple lives had created a stronger appreciation for her remaining ones. 

The suggestion was met with a brief glare. <strong>” I am fine,”</strong> she insisted. <strong>” I just thought I saw something.”</strong> A casual shrug followed.

The orange glow of twilight was gently ebbing away as the night was brought forth. Dusting of stars flickered faintly in the violet-blue sky. Soon they would become more prominent and beautiful. After having checked on her kits, even though they were becoming more independent, Icestar trotted down the Highledge. Spotting Marigolddust’s shadow near the thorn tunnel, the lynx-point sped up her pace towards her friend.

<strong>” Hey,”</strong> she breathed out. <strong>” You ready?”</strong> A casual question at first glance but the embers in her blue-green eyes said otherwise. If Marigolddust wished to change his mind about stepping up in Fernpaw’s place, now was the best time to do it. While it was still possible after the ceremony, it would be more difficult to do so. Now was his last change to back away easily and continue on with his warrior duties.

Ultimately this wall of obstacles wasn’t going anywhere until they began to tear it down. Two sets of paws working at it was better than nothing, as she assumed the others she’d assigned to this task had been taking a break. This was exhausting work, but it needed to be done, and fast. She shot her apprentice one more look of encouragement, before she began to scrape at the dirt once again. It’d take time, but she was determined to free her clanmates.

One boulder at a time.

<em><strong><em>- Close Past -</em></strong></em>

Marigolddust cast a glance towards the stars above his head, and despite their current dullness, he knew how strong the beings who they represented were.  It was a beautiful sight, watching the sky change colors in front of his eyes, but at the same time the twinkling stars that seemed to have been sprinkled over the sky like dew on a leaf didn&#39;t provide him with as much comfort as he wished.  Sure, he had always been generally faithful towards Starclan, but he&#39;d never <em>met</em> them before... At least, he didn&#39;t think he had.  Earlier that day he had spotted something that had been too hard to recognize as reality.  He could have sworn that he had saw Rooksnap at the ceremonies, but at the same time, how could he have laid eyes on a Starclan cat so early in this new rank of his?  Especially a cat who had passed not long before the meeting.  

             Milk-tipped ears perked as a familiar voice broke through his thoughts.  The distraction caused him to jump a little, startled, although as he looked over to who it had been, he recognized the she-cat faster than you could blink.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, still a bit shaken by being dragged from his own head so quickly.  He was about to agree, the clear and easy answer that he had given the leader every time she had asked, until he registered the message in her eyes.  <em>This is your last chance.</em> Of course this fact caused the tom to falter, it would do that to anyone, wouldn&#39;t it?  This was his last chance to back out and return to normal life, to a life with hunting and patrols... Who knew, maybe he would get another apprentice or two in the future if he refused.</span>

           But, the fact that the life he would be returning to would be one without Fernpaw and Rooksnap and instead with a new cat healing the clan convinced him otherwise.  If he could, he would prevent at least one of those changes.  Plus, with Starclan backing him up, he had to be confident in their choice.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Of course,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, a soft smile crossing his features despite his anxiety over what they were about to do.  ,<em><strong>*&quot;I&#39;m ready whenever you are.&quot; *</strong></em>

<em><strong><em>- Close Past -</em></strong></em>

It felt good to finally see Wolfprowl take a bite of the prey.  It might not have shown in too strongly, but in Marigolddust&#39;s mind, he registered the action as him getting a big closer to Wolfprowl listening to what he suggested.  Despite how little help he could provide, he was determined to provide all he could.  <em>Sunhigh?</em> He repeated, although the word was repeated in his mind and his mind only.  Sunhigh... It was fairly dark now, which meant about half a sun&#39;s journey ago, didn&#39;t it?  Marigolddust wasn&#39;t sure whether to be more or less concerned for his brother with the knowledge.  Part of him expected this to have been Wolfprowl&#39;s first time retching such contents, but another part of him expected it would have been longer.  It seemed like forever ago since the clan had been in good shape, and it changed his view on these things a bit more than he would have liked.  

               So, Wolfprowl had been as sick as he was now since Sunhigh... That did seem like a decent amount of time, although Marigolddust couldn&#39;t imagine how much food his brother must have lost to the sickness infecting his body.  <em>Maybe I should have gotten something a bit higher for him?</em> He wondered, glancing down at the partly eaten sparrow unsurely.  Perhaps a rabbit would have done better, or at the very least a squirrel or robin.  <em>No, he would have just refused it,</em> Marigolddust reminded himself.  Oh, why did his brother have to be so stubborn?  Marigolddust could only hope that Wolfprowl was the only one, but sharing a den with Fernpaw had said otherwise.  Wolfprowl&#39;s dry joke didn&#39;t make Marigolddust laugh, and instead made him think deeper than he wished he had.  Shaking his head to get the ideas out of his head, he sent his brother a bit of a worried look.</span>

He decided it would be best to leave the rest of the finch for Wolfprowl, and kept away from it as he waited for his brother to finish eating it.  That, at the least, would be a good sign.

The warrior took another bite, chewing in silence for a few moments.

<strong>&quot;Are you adjusting?&quot;</strong> The question about his new rank sounded more like an expectant parent than gentle curiosity. Hey, at least he was asking; whether that was for the sake of the clan or for conversing with his estranged brother was uncertain. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

A smile was brought forth after Marigolddust’s answer. It wasn’t his words that had brought such warmth to her heart but the confidence that simmered in his golden eyes. No longer was he the same feline who hesitated and questioned his own decisions. Here was ThunderClan’s new medicine cat before her with a disposition that reminded her of the gentle but insistent waves of the lake. 

<em>If we interpreted that message wrong and StarClan doesn’t accept him as the new medicine cat, I’ll wring it into them!</em> While she respected her ancestors, she wouldn’t be able to accept their rejection. To her, Marigolddust was a perfect medicine cat and she trusted the choices the three of them made in regards to his new position.

<em><strong><em>- Close Past -</em></strong></em>

Icestar&#39;s smile was quite the comfort, and in that moment Marigolddust felt more sure in his agreement than ever before.  Sure, there were reasons why he felt he must go where they were heading today, but his reasons for accepting this new rank weren&#39;t only for those around him anymore.  An example of that was now, as he felt his heart swell at Icestar&#39;s confidence.  He had grown to trust the silver point with his life, likely because she had saved it less than a moon ago.  He had put his trust in Laurelblaze, too, although the bond of friendship he felt they might have was forming a bit slower and steadier.  Even so, he expected it might be tricky to take such things slowly once he had truly gained the acceptance of the stars.  

<em>If</em> he received the acceptance of the stars.  

              It was tricky for Marigolddust&#39;s mind to wrap around what it might be like to look into the godly eyes of a Starclan cat, and how it would feel to hear voices that he would only ever hear in his dreams.  He had only ever heard stories of the life after death, and he was as confident in the truth of Starclan&#39;s stories as he was with the Dark Forest&#39;s.  Hopefully Starclan was made up of as many good-hearted cats as the elder&#39;s stories had claimed, or the chance of him being accepted would be even lower than they already were, even if their opinion didn&#39;t seem to change where he would be tomorrow.  It was truly heart warming to see how determined Icestar and Laurelblaze had become to see him in the medicine cat den, but it also made his fur want to spike.  He was scared for the clan, for the fem Infront of him and Laurelblaze.  What if he wasn&#39;t accepted?  What might happen then?  Would the duo allow Starclan to make the choice?  What if they didn&#39;t?  Everything could go wrong with a single word from the twinkling figures, and the very idea terrified him more than he would like to admit.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">With a single blink, the world of possibilities seemed to nearly fade away, and instead of judgmental stars his eyes found uprooted shrubbery and fallen leaves.  Icestar&#39;s words had nearly passed over his head, but his ears had managed to catch them before they could, acting as nets for the syllables as they pricked to attention.  Replacing his distracted gaze with a concluding smile, he dipped his head slightly in agreement.  Trying to ignore his own head, he turned, tail tip being where his head was just moments before, and padded out of the camp.  There was some hesitance behind his movements, as he was not yet used to the idea of leading such a trip, but he imagined it like a gathering.  Perhaps he and Icestar could be late to the forest-wide meeting, and they were just catching up with the rest of the clan?  Yes, that was a more reasuring thought than the two going out alone at such a dark hour, even if he still placed every pawstep with as much tenderness as he would of he had come out alone.  The last thing they needed was for a fox or badger to come out of the dulling bushes and intercept their course of action.  He trusted that Icestar would be close behind, as it was hard not to when the leader always had such a determined look behind her eyes.  At times, Marigolddust believed that Icestar could face off a fox with a mere, imposing glare.  So, why not trust her to take care of herself, even if they did end up separated?

<em><strong><em>- Close Past -</em></strong></em>

It was quite nice, not hearing an objection after Marigolddust&#39;s suggestion, even if it was a little unexpected.  He couldn&#39;t help but feel as if he were acting a but pushy towards his brother, but at the same time he knew that this was a habit he would have to develop if he were to be able to assist even the most stubborn cats in the clan.  Icestar, for example, didn&#39;t seem to like to eat herbs all that much.  From what he had witnessed while sharing the medicine cat&#39;s den, it didn&#39;t seem like Fernpaw had a very easy time with the leader, especially when it came to the consumption of herbs.  Hopefully it would be a little easier for him to deal with such situations when necessary, especially after he attempted to do so early on, like with Wolfprowl now.  And, so far, it seemed like he was doing alright... Even if progress was slow.    

              The question was a bit unexpected.  Marigolddust was unused to his brother asking him such questions, or really speaking to him at all, for that matter.  It wasn&#39;t like Marigolddust didn&#39;t do the same, but he was tended to be a bit more... <em>Polite</em> than Wolfprowl when it came to conversations, at least with each other and their other family members.  Marigolddust doubted that Wolfprowl had really spoken to any of their other siblings since he had changed his name in an act of disowning the family as a whole, and even if he had, it was unlikely that he said anything friendly to them.  It was surprising to the medic that he had managed to start a conversation with the tom in the first place, although the idea of keeping it going was a whole different problem.</span>

              Curling his tail over he paws, he tried to think up an answer to the question, preferably an answer that wouldn&#39;t result in the smokey warrior leaving or ignoring him.  It was important for Wolfprowl to take care of himself, even if Marigolddust didn&#39;t quite know how to cure him and the others of this sickness yet.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I.. think so.  It&#39;s a little bit odd, I guess, hunting for herbs instead of prey,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, holding back from adding, <em>especially herbs I don&#39;t even know the use for,</em> to the end of the statement.  Ever since he had been named the medicine cat, he had tried to stay with searching and gathering herbs instead of prey, although there were a few cases where he would gather a morsel of prey or two to both help out the clan food-wise and to keep himself busy.  In truth, it was hard to adjust and change the way he had always known life to be, especially when rules became so much more relaxed and physical expectations so much more lowered.  Sure, he didn&#39;t have to be muscled to be better in battle anymore, and he didn&#39;t even <em>need</em> to be in any battles, but how could it be easy to adjust from needing to be fit to needing to be intelegent?  He already had troubles remembering clanmates&#39; names as it is, so how could he remember what different herbs were called and what they were used for?  There was definitely a lot of change and adjustment he had to go through, yet he still wouldn&#39;t take back his choice, despite all of the troubles it may bring him.

The plans enacted by her compatriots along with herself had been successful so far, but she couldn’t help but to feel unease, as if she were being <em>watched</em>. Silentwing had brought on new cats for their plans, but the young warrior couldn’t help but to feel as if that were a grave mistake, that they needed to do something about it. They couldn’t trust these newcomers, they should have looked into more options first. <em>If she’s getting desperate, she’s going to sabotage her own plans… Dammit! I will see it through, we have to succeed, our lives now depend on this plan!</em> she could feel her jaw tighten, and her claws gripped at the camp floor. It had been a few days since she was finally able to return from the outside, the camp entrance had been restored, thus the clan would be slowly regaining their strength as they were able to replenish lost supplies. <em>We need to move fast before we end up losing our advantage!</em> 

A sigh escaped her lips through gritted  teeth, before she composed herself. She couldn’t afford to draw attention to herself right now, Finchbriar refused to be a weak link, she needed to remain calm. All will go well if they followed the plan. Especially since she was working with those fools, they could listen to her.

Finchbriar took another deep breath and began to inspect the ruined camp. This was what she’d be inheriting when she finally cemented her control over the remnants of ThunderClan, where they’d be bowing down to her. <strong>”It needs a lot of work… Good thing I won’t be the one doing it.”</strong> she smirked lightly as she muttered to herself under her breath, figuring it was time for her to be planning out her glorious future. The future where she’d be a peerless ruler, an empress of divine proportions, <em>perfection in every way possible</em>. Her clanmates should have considered themselves lucky she was even in their presence for so long. They’d realize soon enough.

Delusions could bring so much bliss, after all.

The split-pelt molly titled her head at Icestar&#39;s reply, a questioning light residing among her eyes. <em>Everything might be alright for you, but it certainly isn&#39;t for Thunderclan as a whole.</em> The clan had finally freed themselves from being trapped within the camp&#39;s walls and were able to enter the dens freely as well - but there was still quite a lot to do. There was still quite a bit to deal with. To Mistypaw, they were <em>far</em> from fine.
    Yet, she held her tongue. For now. Mistypaw blinked and turned her gaze to where Icestar had previously been looking. <strong>&quot;What did you see? Or think you saw?&quot; she questioned, flicking her tail. </strong>&quot;What if its a sign for worse it come in our future?&quot;** She wasn&#39;t sure if leaders could see things that held such importance, but then again she wasn&#39;t about to miss out on any opportunities to gain knowledge. Starclan had enjoyed allowing for disaster to overwhelm the clan so far...maybe they weren&#39;t done just yet.

<em><strong><em>- Close Past -</em></strong></em>

Wolfprowl&#39;s judgment was the last thing that Marigolddust&#39;s self confidence needed, and as his brother took on the criticism-filled look, Marigolddust felt as if he had shrunk, even if only a little bit.  He shouldn&#39;t, and wouldn&#39;t, have been too bothered by the tom&#39;s opinion, but when it came to how he was doing with this new rank it stung.  Sure, Wolfprowl&#39;s opinion might have been biased because Marigolddust shared his blood, but it wasn&#39;t like the smoky warrior&#39;s judgmental take on Marigolddust had gone without reason.  Thoughts only came to a cat&#39;s head when they were inspired to, no matter how small the inspiration.  He must have been doing something wrong, which only concluded his fears.  

               Tucking his paws underneath him, he adverted his gaze to the mouse, looking away from Wolfprowl in the hope of ignoring everything his brother could be thinking.  But it was useless; his self-conscious only grew the more that he laid there, examining the ground as if searching for something in-between the blades of greying grass.  He doubted that nobody else felt the same way that Wolfprowl must have been thinking.  They might have just been hiding how they felt to make him feel better.  What was the use of criticizing your only medicine cat, anyways?  It would only leave you with nothing, rather than a cat who seemed only a bit more significant than he may have before.  His ears swerved back as the thoughts continued to come to him, no longer going in one ear and out the other like they usually did.  Instead, they stayed trapped between his eyes, gathering like a swarm of hornets aiming to build their nest in his brain.  It was surprising, how such a small gesture could bring such troubling chaos, even if it was visible only in his own head.</span>

               Marigolddust received no true response besides the toxic look, and as a result Marigolddust found himself as mute as a fawn hiding from a threat.  The only thing was, he couldn&#39;t hide from the beast that had clung to his fur the moment before.  It took him quite some time to voice a response.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Take care of yourself,&quot;</em></strong></em> he murmured softly, but his brother was already well gone, and the only company he was left with was the half eaten sparrow.

Answering Mistypaw’s question was not favourable but Icestar wasn’t up for lying or avoiding the question. <strong>” I thought I saw Hawkstar,”</strong> the lynx-point shrugged casually. <strong>” The previous ThunderClan leader.”</strong> Icestar added. She wasn’t sure if Mistypaw had been alive during the light-brown tabby’s reign. <strong>” It must have been the trick of a light. Hawkstar is long gone.”</strong> Or else she wouldn’t have received her nine lives.

<strong>” Why don’t we go looking for herbs for Marigolddust?”</strong> She suggested out of the blue. <strong>” I heard he was running out of poppy seeds.”</strong> With all the injuries and pain that the Clan was enduring, the newly-appointed medicine cat was probably low on this vital treatment. <strong>” I know a spot that has a bunch of poppies we can get it from and I’ll teach you how to get it so you can help him out if he ever needs it.”</strong> Just because Mistypaw was going down the path of a warrior doesn’t mean that she was exempt from helping the medicine cat. The more one knew, the more they can help others.

The days of the storms had passed and given way to clearer skies and sunshine. Leaf-fall had brought colder weather and a light breeze swept through the sunlit clearing, scattering crimson and orange leaves across the earth. It was just after sunrise as Wrenpaw slipped quietly from the apprentices den, amber gaze exhausted and her brown tail dragging the ground. The last two nights her sleep had been restless and she felt as if she’d gotten no sleep at all. She was too scared to fall asleep and wake up in the shadowy forest again. She fluffed up her cream and brown pelt against the chill, making her way to a secluded corner of the camp and huddling there by herself. Perhaps if she slept in the day her chances of going back to that horrible place would be more slim? No, she couldn’t do that. She was an apprentice with duties to attend to and training to do. She couldn’t sleep the day away. She groaned softly, lifting a white mitt and licking it, drawing it over each of her ears in turn. 

A part of her wanted to seek out one of her friends, but another part of her knew that was a bad idea. Aside from Icestar and Laurelblaze, there was no other cat who could know where she had been or what she had witnessed. As much as she would love to confide in those she cared about, she knew that she couldn’t. Somehow, that made things even worse. Just days ago her only worries had been hunting for her clan and helping them with repair efforts after the landslide. Now she had a much larger burden to bear, and she wasn’t so sure that she was fit to carry it. What choice did she have? She didn’t have a choice at all, and she hated it. A troubled expression clouded her features and she bowed her head, staring at her paws. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

The young tom was oblivious to the plight that not only his close friend was facing, but along with a few of the others. He’d been focused on training as well as hunting for the clan while the warriors were stuck in camp, he had an innate talent for the skill, his lithe frame allowed him to chase down fast prey with ease. He was growing into a fine warrior, but he still had quite a ways to go before he truly mastered his skills. For now, he was working hard in order to help his clan survive, he had to put everything else aside. Still, that didn’t mean he couldn’t leave the cats involved in his life alone for too long, he had an obligation to check on them once in a while.

Besides, the way Wrenpaw appeared to be acting these past couple days had worried him. She wasn’t herself, even he, a cat who normally didn’t pick up on social cues and behavior changes easily, could see that. She was awfully pensive as of late. 

The long-limbed tom padded towards the caramel-colored molly, ducking his  head downward so he could meet her gaze as it was traveling to the floor. <strong>”You look down, what’s going on Wrenpaw?”</strong> he was blunt, immediately getting to the point. She wasn’t behaving like normal, and this all happened so sudden, it must have been something bad. He figured he could try to help her, if he even could.

Beanspark purred, <strong>&quot;Oh yes, always a good thing!&quot;</strong> He agreed. Hearing kits romp and play was always a sign that the clan was doing well, even in hard times. It kept up some spirits, at least. 

Beanspark tilted his head slightly, beginning to sit down and settle. A slight anxiety began to tingle in his chest. Was she worried about him?

With a smile, he bowed his head as well. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m Beanspark.&quot;</strong> He felt it a bit silly to introduce himself formally after he had already done so, but he knew that&#39;s what she would prefer. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m glad to be here to help, you know?

A small gasp slipped her maw as her friend approached, straightening her posture and trying to smooth her now bristling pelt. <strong>”Oh, Coyotepaw! I’m sorry I’m just a bit… jumpy.”</strong> That wasn’t entirely a lie, though it wasn’t the whole truth either. Jumpy didn’t even cover it anymore. Wrenpaw was terrified of everything that moved as of late, and she was having a hard time covering it up. She felt guilty for having to cover it up, and she felt embarrassed for not being able to control her own emotions. What would everyone start saying about her if she couldn’t hold herself together, and couldn’t even provide an explanation as to why she was feeling how she was feeling? The caramel fem knew she had to stop thinking about things like that. It would get better, right? It had to. For now, she had to compose herself. 

She cleared her throat, giving a few casual licks of her white chest fur. <strong>”There’s just a lot going on right now. Marigolddust has to split his duties between learning how to be a medicine cat and keeping up with my training. I feel kind of bad about it.”</strong> She admitted. That wasn’t a lie either. Despite how happy she was to still have Marigolddust as her mentor, she felt a bit guilty that his work load was doubled now. Then again, that didn’t explain her anxious behavior and depressing aura, either. Perhaps she could give Coyotepaw a tad bit more of the truth. <strong>”I’ve also been having, um… nightmares. I know it’s dumb, but I haven’t been sleeping well.”</strong> That was more honest. It had <em>felt</em> like a nightmare, even though it was completely real. She wished it was a nightmare. She also hoped that her answer would satisfy her friend and that he wouldn’t keep prodding. Wrenpaw wanted nothing more than to tell Coyotepaw everything. She considered him her closest friend, but she knew she couldn’t say anything. 

Perhaps now was a good time for a subject change. She offered him a friendly smile, casting away the thoughts that plagued her mind. The two hadn’t spoken a lot since the landslide, since he’d witnessed his mother lose a life. <strong>”How are you? I know things have been hectic around here lately,”</strong> she mused. She appreciated him checking in on her, and honestly she felt a little guilty about not checking in on him lately. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

She didn’t appear to be lying to him, but some part of him felt as if she wasn’t giving the full truth. His brow visibly furrowed at the mention of her having nightmares, and he frowned lightly. <strong>”Do you wanna talk about it?”</strong> he had completely missed her own question about his well-being, so focused on whether she was willing to share whatever it was that was weighing down on her shoulders. What he was dealing with didn’t seem as important as what she was doing, and he figured maybe he could help. They had each other’s backs, thick as thieves those two, they saved each other’s skins during the landslide.

<em>Right?</em>

He sat up now, still staring at her with concern flooding his leaf-green gaze. <strong>”You’re not acting like you normally do, what sort of nightmares are they?”</strong> even he knew the things that appeared in any of his nightmares weren’t real, but she was acting as if it were some kind of boogeyman ready to snatch her up in the night. He understood if it kept her awake for a while, but she looked exhausted, almost as if she hadn’t been sleeping. <strong>”You haven’t been staying awake this whole time, right?”</strong>

Her gaze softened at his question. He was obviously concerned, which only made her want to confess more. Of course she <em>wanted</em> to talk about it, but unfortunately it wasn’t that simple. The fem also couldn’t explain that there were things that she wanted to tell him but wasn’t allowed to. She knew she would get in trouble if she opened her mouth, and that her little secret had the potential to put the entire clan at even greater risk than it already was. Wrenpaw was a bit disappointed that her subject change had been ineffective, but she didn’t show it. 

A frown overcame her features. It wasn’t surprising that Coyotepaw noticed she wasn’t acting like herself. She was trying to act like herself, but it was hard after the things that she had witnessed. <strong>”I- I know. I’m sorry.”</strong> She had no reason to apologize and she knew that, but she couldn’t help it. <strong>”They’re um… they’re bad, Coyotepaw.”</strong> She admitted, shifting uneasily on her paws. How much exactly could she reveal without revealing <em>too</em> much? Her head dropped again, fixated on the ground. <strong>”They’re not like normal nightmares. They feel so real. They’re scary. Bad things happen and I… I’ve been trying to sleep, really.”</strong> 

That was Wrenpaw’s way of somewhat avoiding his question. She wanted to sleep, but she didn’t want to go to the dark place again so she tried to sleep as little as possible. She didn’t really know how much sleep she had been getting, but it hadn’t been much. Her eyes met his, and her gaze was almost pleading. She wanted someone to know her turmoil so badly, and yet she’d made a vow to her clan not to say a word. Coyotepaw was her best friend though, and it was so hard for her to keep it from him. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

What Coyotepaw hadn’t realized was that he was treading on dangerous territory, asking these questions, he was unaware of the shadow conflict emerging around them, and that Wrenpaw was caught in the middle— forced to weave a web of lies in order to protect the other members of the clan as well as herself. He didn’t know just how dire the situation really was, that these weren’t just nightmares for her, it was <em>reality</em>. The Dark Forest was a very real place, not something that was a mere story about monsters queens told to their kits in order for them to stay in the den at night. Wrenpaw was risking her life, deceiving the cats who recruited her to betray her clan. Cats who could easily kill her, cats who he was unaware of. Here he was, asking questions and putting both their lives at risk.

<em>He needed to know when to stop.</em>

Coyotepaw’s frown only stretched more, and a feeling of dread began to overtake him. She was being evasive, not giving actual details. Was there a reason why she was doing that? What was so bad that she couldn’t tell him exactly what was bothering her? <strong>”Don’t push yourself too much, if you can’t sleep at night you can just wake me up and I can talk. I don’t mind.”</strong> it beat being the only other cat awake at the hour, he could just fall back asleep when he needed to. Wrenpaw also deserved her rest, because not getting enough sleep was never good for anyone. Still, he was unaware of the danger that sleep posed for her. One wrong step, one slip-up, and it could be the last mistake she ever made. <strong>”If you want to talk more about it, I’m all ears. But you seriously look worse for wear, you have to get sleep.”</strong>

It wasn’t hard to tell by his expression that Coyotepaw didn’t entirely believe what she was telling him. Perhaps it was more obvious than she had initially thought that she was leaving out key details of her so called nightmares, but it was really all she could give him. She hoped that he wouldn’t be too upset with her. When the truth eventually did come out, Wrenpaw was sure that her friend would come to understand her secrecy. Maybe she couldn’t tell him everything right now, but just speaking with him was already lifting some of the weight off of her shoulders. Wrenpaw knew that her friend had her back, and it made her feel better. A smile returned to her lips. <strong>”You’d really do that?”</strong> She asked. Of course he would, although the molly seriously doubted she’d ever want to wake him from a restful sleep. <strong>”Thank you. If it ever gets too bad I’ll take you up on that offer,”</strong> she said with a little grin. 

A small sigh left her. <strong>”I know. I’ll try. I mean, I can’t stay awake forever, right?”</strong> She asked, stifling a light laugh. Truthfully she didn’t think she could stay awake tonight, even if she wanted to. She was exhausted and quite certain that when she laid in her nest later that falling asleep would be inevitable. Wrenpaw nudged Coyotepaw softly with an outstretched paw. <strong>”Thank you. I appreciate you listening to me. Maybe we can talk about you for a while? I’d rather take my mind off of my own things right now, ya know?”</strong> She hoped that maybe this time the change of subject would be effective. <strong>”How are things? How’s training?”</strong> She asked with a warm smile. She felt less like she was pretending to feel better now. She actually felt… better. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

He was glad his friend was willing to confide in him, even if she was shielding him from just what was plaguing her in her dreams. Part of him wished she’d trusted him enough to speak up on it, but Wrenpaw usually was forthright with him, not evasive. It worried him a bit, but maybe she had her reasons. A part of him was telling him to not question her any further, he had a bad feeling about it. As if he were being watched.

<em>Surely not, but maybe its best I play it safe.</em>

He nodded lightly as she circled back to her original line of questioning into his life, and the young tom let out a small sigh. <strong>”It’s exhausting, that’s what it is.”</strong> he let out a small sigh, stretching out his long limbs for a moment as he stared wistfully at the fresh-kill pile. <strong>”I don’t know how many squirrels I brought in alone in the past few weeks, we were doing both the work of an apprentice and a warrior for a good while. You think my mother’s gonna reward us all with names at the end of this?”</strong> he doubted it, as they both still had a good few moons to go before they were promoted to warriors. Still, wishful thinking always provided some form of incentive to their work, there was always the small chance. <em>I doubt it though, and honestly I’d rather be held back a bit to catch up on the training I missed while Strikethroat was stuck.</em> It was over now, for the most part, they were just fixing up the apprentice’s den, which luckily withstood much of the damage since it was a cave itself, mostly requiring excavation and light maintenance before it was seen as fit to act as living quarters for the apprentices. He missed his nest. <strong>”Could be worse, honestly. Things are looking up.”</strong>

That’s what he thought, anyhow.

Luckily for the golden molly, Coyotepaw seemed ready to drop their discussion about her this time. He didn’t seem so keen on talking about himself either, but at least he didn’t have some big secret that he had to keep away from her. Maybe if they talked about things that regular apprentices often discussed she could temporarily forget her situation and feel like everything was normal. What Wrenpaw craved more than anything was some sense of normalcy, even if it was all just a facade. It sounded like her friend hadn’t been having the best time lately, either. In truth, all the apprentices had been having a rough go of things lately. 

She nodded, her expression understanding. It <em>had</em> been exhausting carrying the duties of warriors and apprentices at the same time. Sure, they had missed out on quite a bit of training with the warriors stuck in camp, but Wrenpaw had personally learned a lot with her temporary duties. Her hunting had improved immensely in her opinion, so at least something good had come out of it all. <strong>”I know what you mean. It’s been hard but on the bright side, I think a lot of our hunting skills have improved. It’s no easy feat having to hunt for a whole clan,”</strong> she meowed, a light smile forming on her maw. She tipped her head to the side, pondering his question for a few moments. What if she did? Wrenpaw hadn’t even thought about getting her warrior name anytime soon, but she supposed it could be a possibility. <strong>”You never know, she might. I know we’re a bit young still but I think we’ve proved ourselves as assets to the clan. I could use some more battle training sessions, though,”</strong> she said. Sure, her hunting had improved and her muscles had gotten much stronger with all the help repairing the walls of the camp and the dens, but it had been some time since she’d practiced her fighting moves. Perhaps a touch up on those things and they really could have a shot at their warrior names. 

<em>Things are looking up.</em> She wanted to share that hope so badly, but his words only brought worries back to her troubled mind. If she hadn’t seen the things she had, she might really believe that things were looking up. The clan was recovering from the landslide no doubt, but she had a feeling that ThunderClan’s troubles were only just beginning. Still, she had to play the part. <strong>”Yeah, I think things will be back to normal soon. We can just be apprentices again,”</strong> she mused. <em>I really wished that were true.</em> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

In the days since the landslide things had been looking quite bleak. The rains had seemed to pass for the most part, with only the occasional drizzle now. Of course, it was just enough to keep everything and everyone damp. Today the sun had managed to peak through the thick clouds that floated across the cerulean sky, if only briefly. Carrying the duties of both warrior and apprentice hadn’t been easy, but Wrenpaw was very determined to provide for her clan as much as she could while they were experiencing this tragedy. They’d lost a lot in just one day. The camp was almost unrecognizable with nearly every den destroyed and covered in a thick layer of mud and debris. The camp wall had only mere holes to squeeze through, almost to small even for the apprentices. Pushing her way through one of said gaps, Wrenpaw held a squirrel and a mouse in her jaws. She felt like she had mud up to her ears, but she was still feeling quite proud of her catch. It was better than coming back with nothing, and it was important to keep the clan well fed. 

She deposited her catch on the fresh-kill pile, frowning slightly at the state of it. Prey had been relatively hard to find since the heavy rains, which wasn’t helping their situation at all. Perhaps after a bit of a rest she could go back out and hunt again. It was still strange, coming and going from the camp as she pleased without her mentor or another warrior to serve as an escort. That kind of freedom could have kind of fun had it been under different circumstances. Right now, it felt overwhelming more than anything.  Shaking out her pelt, Wrenpaw made her way towards the edge of the camp where the ground was a bit higher and ever so slightly less wet. She would love to get some of the mud off of herself, even if it seemed like a hefty chore at the moment. She sat down on a smooth rock and began to groom herself, lips curled back as she felt revolted by the taste of the mud. She couldn’t wait for everything to go back to normal. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

He was not the lazy sort, of course, he handled his work and did as he was told to do. Coyotepaw minded himself and his behavior, being the son of the clan’s leader had its sort of expectations he was supposed to abide by. He stayed out of trouble, and minded his business. The young tom didn’t believe he was superior to the others, in fact he was rather thankful that for the most part he was treated rather normally. It wasn’t like his mother’s role was inherited, he’d be living the life of an average ThunderClan warrior. He wasn’t going to let his lineage make him feel entitled to special treatment, he too needed to pull his own weight for the clan. <strong>”Still, I’m not sure she will just yet. I think she’ll want to hold off until she knows we are absolutely ready. Until then, I guess we just have to keep training and prove it.”</strong> he flicked an ear as he glanced up at the Highledge for just a moment, wondering if his mother indeed was inside her den. It had been some time since he last stepped in there, the apprentice’s den was wildly different than when he shared a nest with his mother and his siblings as kits. He was much bigger now, his lanky limbs ended up stretching across his nest fully now. He’d grown to be a very tall cat.

<strong>”You think so? I can’t wait for things to go back to normal so I can get back to my collections.”</strong> his lips curled into a subtle grin, the thought of attending to his beloved collections of prey bones was his biggest hobby— and this entire ordeal had taken him away from them. Coyotepaw couldn’t wait to attend to them again, even if he was looking to branch out into other collections. <strong>”Its been far too long.”</strong>

<em><strong><em>- Past -</em></strong></em>

He had decided.  Marigolddust had told both Laurelblaze and Icestar that he would be the medicine cat the day before, and now they just had to wait for the right time to announce it in front of the clan.  Even this early on, though, it had been difficult to focus on anything dealing with his future duties.  How was he supposed to focus on herbs and the enterances when he found himself hiding at night, letting loose endless tears at the realization that his best friend would no longer be by his side?  It was likely he would never see Fernpaw&#39;s tired yet welcoming face again, or hear her friendly &quot;good morning&quot; every time the sun came up.  He had moved to the Medicine cat&#39;s den to provide her with comfort, but recently Marigolddust found himself wondering who would do the same for him now that the sandalwood fem was gone.  This morning, he quickly swept away the tears with a quick, smooth movement of his paw, just as he had every time he had woken up since the landslide.  

               His brain felt a big numb from a night of troubling thoughts, but he tried to clear it as he rubbed his tired eyes.  He had something he had to focus on today, something that couldn&#39;t wait for his heart to calm.  He was well aware of the fact that Icestar would be announcing the fact that he was the new medicine cat Infront of the clan soon, but he wanted to tell a certain cat the news before the point did.  He felt it was necessary; it was the least he could do for his apprentice, letting her know what was going on in private rather than letting a public announcement tell her of the news.  Marigolddust knew that this situation would effect her greatly, and for the first time, he would take the matters of announcements into his own paws rather than Icestar&#39;s, even if just for one cat.  Hopefully it wasn&#39;t too rude of him..</span>

            Giving himself a shake, Marigolddust almost tripped.  He was still nauseous for whatever reason, and it seemed like he wasn&#39;t the only one.  Every cat on camp seemed to be feeling off, and even now, he could tell the Thunderclanners weren&#39;t in the tip-top shape.  He had to pause for a moment and wait out the sudden dizziness.  As his vision went back to focus, his eyes landed on a specific apprentice off in the distance.  For a moment Marigolddust felt as if the dizziness were returning, although it was just his anxious nerves getting to him.  Wrenpaw would understand, wouldn&#39;t she?  Of course she would, she wasn&#39;t the type of cat who would hate him for something like this... Was she?  No, no, of course not.  Despite his continual attempts, Marigolddust couldn&#39;t convince himself that this was going to go well.  There were so many possibilities, so many risks.  How would he know how to do this right?  For a second he wondered whether he should leave this up to Icestar after all, although a minute of thought led to the possibility being shot down.  He could do this, and he knew that Wrenpaw would be strong enough to handle this.  How different could it be, anyhow, having a mentor who has become the medic of the clan?  He would do everything he could to keep things normal for Wrenpaw, even if it turned out to be exhausting.  

             Slowely approaching the she-cat, Marigolddust offered her a small smile.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Hey, Wrenpaw.  How are you?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked softly, staying just in front of the rock so that he didn&#39;t risk startling her, if she was unaware of him, that was.  His voice cracked at the start of the sentence, unused to speaking words since yesterday and being tired from inevitable grief.</span>

               Hoping she didn&#39;t notice, Marigolddust tried to keep himself relaxed as he glanced over to the prey pile.  He had spotted her just as she had dropped off her prey.  <em><strong><em>&quot;That was a good catch, you know..  you&#39;re doing very well with hunting on your own.&quot;</em></strong></em> He commented light-heartedly, hoping to distract himself before he moved on to the main reason why he had started the conversation.

She nodded in agreement. He was probably right that even in spite of their recent warrior like responsibilities, they still weren’t quite ready to become warriors. There were times that Wrenpaw still felt like a brand new apprentice, although those days were fading fast. Time seemed to be flying, though that tended to be the case in the wake of tragedy. There was so much work to be done and it consumed every day, leaving little time for anything else. Even if they didn’t become warriors when this whole endeavor was over, the fem was still thinking of how receiving her warrior name didn’t seem that far off regardless. She was ten moons old now, and that meant that she was closer to her warrior ceremony than she expected. It used to be something Wrenpaw thought about constantly, although recently her mind had been overtaken by much different thoughts. She hadn’t really had the time to think about becoming a warrior. <strong>”Yeah, you’re probably right. Our time will come, though. Who knows, maybe our ceremony will even be held at the same time,”</strong> she said with a hopeful grin. How fun would it be for them to receive their names together? Besides, sitting vigil alone all night sounded much worse than doing it with a friend, even though you weren’t allowed to talk. 

Her smile grew more. Without even realizing it, Coyotepaw had been able to take her mind off of everything. Her anxiety had ebbed to the normal amount, her face wasn’t clouded with worry and fear and her eyes didn’t art around the clearing every few moments anymore, as if she was expecting a badger to leap out at her. For the first time in two days she was feeling something besides fear and worry. She felt… happy. For the time being, at least. A small purr rumbled in her throat as the tom mentioned his favorite hobby, and memories of them as kits played through her head. Their first interaction ever Wrenpaw had helped him find a secret location in the camp to store his bones. <strong>”I can’t believe I almost forgot about that! It seems like forever since we’ve been able to do anything normal, but I’m sure you’ll be able to get back to it soon.”</strong> At least, she hoped that was the case. She gave him a friendly nudge. <strong>”And don’t forget if you ever need help with hiding places or gathering things, I’m your cat,”</strong> she mused. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

Mid wash and with her senses over encumbered by mud, Wrenpaw didn’t notice her mentors approach until he greeted her. She attempted to spit out a bit of grit that had stuck to her tongue as she turned her head towards him, probably looking quite silly as she did so. <strong>”Oh, hi!”</strong> She greeted cheerfully, a broad smile on her features. She was always happy to see the warrior, even under dire circumstances such as their present. She couldn’t help but to think he looked terrible. Despite his best efforts to remain upbeat, she could tell that underneath all of that he was sad. Of course he was. He’d lost Fernpaw, and everyone in the clan knew how dear the fem had been to Marigolddust. Her heart swelled with pity though a smile remained on her face. She didn’t want to bring him down any more than he already was, and sometimes it seemed like her cheerfulness rubbed off on him so perhaps today she could lend him a little happiness, even if it was only temporary. She wished she could wipe all of his grief away, or take it upon herself. She would if only it were possible. She didn’t know how he was feeling, she could only assume. She’d never lost anyone dear to her before, and though she was lucky for that, she felt bad that she couldn’t really understand the depth of his sorrows. She reached out with a freshly cleaned paw, laying it upon his momentarily. 

<strong>”Never mind how I am. I want to know how you’re doing. I’m… I’m sorry I haven’t checked on you. I’m sorry for everything, really. I know it’s not my fault I just wish that I could help.”</strong> She hadn’t really known what to say to him after the disappearance of Fernpaw had been announced, so Wrenpaw had given the tuxedo his space. Had that been the right thing to do? Her intentions had been good, she only hoped that those intentions hadn’t been mistaken for a lack of caring. Her mentor had a special place in her heart and she considered him to be one of the cats she was closest to in the clan and she hoped that he knew that. She worried that bringing up the topic would only make him more sad. Should she not have said anything? A worried expression clouded her gaze, and for a moment she looked away. <strong>”I’m sorry to bring it up, you don’t have to talk about it. I just want you to know I’m here for you,”</strong> she added, pushing a smile back onto her maw. 

Her amber gaze fluttered to the fresh-kill pile as he complimented her catch, a small purr rumbling in her throat. <strong>”Thank you! It’s been kind of stressful but on the bright side, I do thinks it’s helping my skills a lot. It’s weird being out in the territory without you,”</strong> she admitted. Most apprentices were probably relishing their newfound independence, but Wrenpaw missed the days of hunting and training with Marigolddust. She hoped that they would be able to get back to that soon. Besides, it would provide a good distraction for the grieving tom. Being cooped up all day alone with his sadness couldn’t be easy for him. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

Mistypaw&#39;s own gaze flickered to the leader&#39;s perch, upon which sat no one. Perhaps what Icestar had claimed to see was a trick of the mind or merely the after affects of losing a life or two. Regardless, Mistypaw saw nothing, shrugging as she returned her attention to the lynx-point. A former Thunderclan leader, hm? Had that meant she&#39;d seen a Starclan cat? Or something else? But before the molly could even speak again, Icestar suggested they&#39;d take on a task. Search for herbs.
    <strong>&quot;I&#39;m not a boring ol&#39; medicine cat!&quot;</strong> she hissed, a scowl placed upon her face. She was training to be a warrior, she didn&#39;t have time to look for stinky herbs. Even so, the apprentice would be left with nothing but her own clanmates about her...at least she could get away from camp for a bit. With a moment of further consideration, the molly sighed. <strong>&quot;I <em>could</em> come along though, but I won&#39;t help you look for them.&quot;</strong> she replied a bit later, with a huff.

The surprise in her voice along with a bit of a silly stance caused amusement to tickle at his, chest, bringing a smile to his face.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t mean to disturb you&#39;re grooming,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, a joking tone just strong enough to reveal his lack of seriousness.  It was a nice break from his thoughts, waking up in the morning to see familiar faces such as Wrenpaw&#39;s still around.  Dark thoughts were all too willing to enter his thoughts, and it was always nice to be reminded of what he still had, even if all of this really did seem ridiculous just over loosing a cat.  Two, actually, and you had to add the fact that he had caused his leader to loose I life and lost his own, in a way, even if it was just the life of a warrior that was sacrificed.  Even so, he still felt as if he were being dramatic and attention seeking.  Although Wrenpaw had kind intentions, she managed to make this feeling even stronger.  A flushed look passed over his face for just a moment, and his smile disappeared.  Oh, she&#39;d noticed, hadn&#39;t she?  Adverting his gaze to Wrenpaw&#39;s paw on his.  His eyes returned to his apprentice with an embarrassed smile across his face, one that was unable to burry the discovered sadness again.  <em><strong><em>&quot;O-oh, it&#39;s really okay- It&#39;s nothing.  Training you helps plenty, and that should be my main focus,&quot;</em></strong></em> he reassured, his words rushed as he fidgeted.</span>

             Wrenpaw&#39;s worry caught him off-guard, and he quickly objected to her words.  <em><strong><em>&quot;No, no it&#39;s fine!  Th... thank you for being here with me,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said softly, before sending a quick lick to her forehead, hoping that the gesture would comfort her enough for her to acknowledge that he didn&#39;t mind anything she had done or was doing.  It wasn&#39;t her fault that his face was more of a window rather than a wall, or that he was so bad when it came to receiving attention.  He believed that it was the right thing for Wrenpaw to do, giving him some space.  It was likely he would never get over the loss of his friend, or the idea that she would never come back without a blanket of stars over her shoulders, but with time he hoped he would become more sure in himself and accept what had come to him with the destruction of the landslide.  A lot happened the day the disaster happened, for every cat, including himself.  Icestar, for example, had lost a life as a result, and there were many others who had experienced the same thing, although they didn&#39;t have the stars to give them another chance at life.  He was just one of the fortunate ones, when you didn&#39;t take the loss of others into consideration.</span>

               A relaxation settled into the tom&#39;s position as the topic was changed and moved onto something new.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Of course, I miss being out in the forest with you, too.  But I&#39;m sure that we&#39;ll be out there again soon, as soon as we get the entrances cleared.&quot;</em></strong></em> he agreed, sending a quick glance over to the rubble-covered exits.  If only he hadn&#39;t been too tall to fit through the small exits that the apprentices used, or perhaps he could have been of more help than he was now.  The calm demeanor that had come onto the tuxedo didn&#39;t take long to turn into dark worry as Marigolddust remembered what he was supposed to be sharing with the sandy-furred fem, and he quickly went back to sitting rather stiffly.  <em><strong><em>&quot;U-um, speaking of training, I... I have something to tell you,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, his voice quieted with the fear of how his words might effect his apprentice.  He didn&#39;t want to share this news, and never thought that he&#39;d have to.  Hopefully the fact that she would remain his apprentice would be enough to keep her from worrying.

Seeing Beanspark settle, Icestar hesitated momentarily before her own lithe body lowered towards the ground. She was eager to be out and about. She thrived in an energetic environment but a few heartbeats of relaxation shouldn’t hurt. 

The ThunderClan leader elegantly seated herself in front of him: straight posture, ears erect, tail curled neatly around her form. Bright eyes with twin flames of sea-green watched him curiously.

<strong>” I think Marigolddust will be an amazing medicine cat too,”</strong> she said, glancing over to the herb-scented cavern. <strong>” He is gentle but determined. He has always been around Fernpaw so he is familiar with the field. All he needs is some confidence and experience. You came just at the right time.”</strong> Icestar would be able to help boost his trust in himself but medicine cat experience was out of her level of expertise.

The indignant protest sent a nonexistent eyebrow skyrocketing up her forehead. <strong>” Oh? Is that how you see it?”</strong> Icestar questioned softly. <strong>” I guess you won’t be needing the ‘boring ol’ medicine cat’ when you are bleeding out or fracturing your bones to complete your warrior duties.”</strong> She flicked her feathery tail from side to side, eyeing Mistypaw with her lit ember-like gaze. <strong>” There is one of him and dozens of you. Sparing a set of paws or two won’t hurt.”</strong>

Icestar tipped her head to the side. She was going to reward Mistypaw for her efforts in aiding her but seeing that the femme was stubborn in her little ways, the lynx-point had a feeling she was up for a challenge. Bribing her with this so-called reward was not an option. If Mistypaw only helped in order to receive it then the whole point of her lecture would go to waste and Mistypaw would have learned nothing. Instead, Icestar was going to have to persuade her during their herb-picking excursion.

She chuckled softly. <strong>”Eh, not much point to grooming these days anyways,”</strong> she mused. There was so much mud in the camp and in the territory lately that it was pretty much impossible to keep clean, though thankfully the dirt didn’t stick out too much on Wrenpaw’s golden brown pelt. She felt bad for her clanmates with paler fur. Of course she liked to keep as clean as she could, but she’d never been one to fuss about her appearance too much. Besides, right now appearances didn’t really matter. As far as she was concerned, she would probably be back out hunting again soon or helping with repairs and her fur would just get dirty all over again. <strong>”I’ll be happy if we get some sunshine to dry all this mud up. I’m tired of licking it off of myself, and it gets stuck in between my toes,”</strong> she said, lifting a paw and spreading her toes apart, giving them a little wriggle. They were minor things to complain about though, in the whole scheme of things. A little muck on oneself didn’t even compare to the other problems in the clan right now. Perhaps she shouldn’t be complaining too much. After all, Wrenpaw wasn’t really one to complain a lot, she often kept a positive attitude even when it came to the worst things, so her complaints couldn’t be taken too seriously. She was still more than happy to do her fair share of work and then some, even if it meant having mud up to her ears. 

As Marigolddust’s smile fell away like the leaves from the trees in leafbare, she felt a pang of guilt. <em>I knew I shouldn’t have said anything,</em> she thought miserably. Now she felt even worse than before. Of course, her sadness couldn’t come close to comparing to that of her mentor’s, but seeing his smile falter and <em>knowing</em> that she was the cause hurt her more than he probably realized. Why hadn’t she just kept her mouth shut? If he wanted to talk about Fernpaw’s disappearance she should have let him bring it up at his own will, not because she had pried it out of him. Her intentions had been pure, of course, as she would never purposefully hurt another cat, but right now her intentions didn’t matter. She found herself wanting to apologize again although she knew it wouldn’t do any good now. Apologies didn’t really mean much in a situation like this. Still, her frown deepened as she desperately tried to think of what to say next to correct the damage that she had done. He said that her training should be his main focus, but honestly Wrenpaw couldn’t care less about her training right now, she just wanted Marigolddust to feel better. 

She sighed, a small smile tugging at her lips as his tongue rasped quickly over her forehead. At least he had forgiven her, it seemed. <strong>”Well I’ll always be here for you, but you don’t have to talk about it. I didn’t mean to seem like I was prying, if… if it seemed that way I am sorry. I just wish there was something I could do, you know?”</strong> Wrenpaw seemed to have an unwavering desire to help others, even if it was a cat she barely knew. She would always go above and beyond for any cat, even if that meant putting their problems ahead of her own. She had yet to discover that that wasn’t always the greatest character trait to have. She spent so much time worrying about others, and feeling terrible that she couldn’t help them, when she should spend more time worrying about herself. These weren’t her burdens to bare, and yet she would gladly take them anyways. 

She perked up a bit as he talked about being in the forest together again. <strong>”When this is all over maybe we can go hunting, and I can show you just how much I’ve improved!”</strong> There was a hint of excitement to her tone. Perhaps this was a good way to get both of their minds off of other things right now. The excitement didn’t last long, unfortunately. Anxiety began pricking at her, and she wondered why he sounded like whatever he was about to say was going to be bad</span>

The deputy of ThunderClan had been a rather scarce sight in camp for the past few days, often roaming the territory for hours at a time, trying to hunt or mark borders as she went. Her mind was plagued with terrible thoughts, of plans to ready the clan for absolute warfare if necessary. <em>The Dark Forest… Damn it all!</em> she wanted to scream out to her ancestors, of why her clan had to continually suffer this torment. Why they had to be targeted by unseen forces of darkness, why they had to cope with it all. She loved her clan, she hated the idea of seeing her clanmates be harmed. Yet this was a greater threat than they all had realized, and she had to ensure they were ready.

<em>I’m not letting her get away from this, she’s not going back to the Dark Forest after this. I will destroy her.</em>

A vow had been made, for this was personal for the tortoiseshell femora. Silentwing was once a dear and close friend of hers, only for her to turn traitor and to later target her clan after Laurelblaze had to cut her support of the then-rogue she-cat off. It wasn’t a painless decision, but the livelihood of her clan had been at stake— she couldn’t in good conscience be their deputy and support a traitor who wasn’t seeking redemption for her actions.

Silentwing taught her many lessons about trust, and it only seemed to be getting worse and worse.

And the worst part of all was that she had to stay silent about it. They had to avoid panic.

She wasn’t exactly being subtle about something bothering her, causing her grief in her day-to-day life. The news that they were indeed being preyed upon by dark forces beyond their control was understandably stressful for her, but a large part of her felt responsible for it all. If she hadn’t brought Silentwing to ThunderClan, could this all have been avoided? Her lapse in judgement may have led to this disaster along with others, was this her punishment? Was she meant to atone for her actions this way? 

<em>Then why make the others suffer? Why must they share in my plight?</em>

She was snapped out of her brief period of frustration by a voice ringing out beside her, and she let out a small, light gasp of surprise. The deputy didn’t expect anyone to be listening in on her incoherent mumblings and curses under her breath as she had been clearing through debris in some of the dens. It was almost therapeutic in a strange way, but she felt that she’d be better if she were to just sink her claws into Silentwing’s throat already. To be done with it all.

Never had she wished to kill another cat, much less <em>again</em>. That wasn’t who she was, but Silentwing had crossed the line long ago, she’d murdered clanmates of hers, betrayed her trust. She’d stabbed her in the back many times over, and she was collecting justice for the cats she was harming in her path of revenge. Even if she was sinking to that level, Laurelblaze was positive that the other tortoiseshell wouldn’t stop until she was dead, dead, <em>dead!</em>

<strong>”Its nothing important, I’m just exhausted from work.”</strong>

A lie, she never grew tired from her work— she was practically addicted. Yet it served its purpose, something else that <em>was</em> related to work was dragging her down currently.

It wasn’t the camp anymore for her, she was able to get out into the territory and quash her stir-craziness. It was the fact that the same old problems seem to be cropping up in her life in an endless cycle. Laurelblaze was tired of it, she didn’t want her clan to suffer for the mistakes <em>she</em> had made. The repercussions for her past lapses in judgement were putting others in harm’s way, and she felt immense guilt for it.

Hence why she was so hell-bent on destroying the source of her fury, of their pain. Forcing <em>apprentices</em> to watch her wicked schemes play out, turning her clanmates against her. That was a crime that warranted a swift and sudden execution. Silentwing would not escape when she decided to rear her ugly head again. <em>I won’t allow her.</em>

Wolfprowl’s offer made her let out a small, exasperated sigh. She’d been taking her rage out on dirt and stones, tearing out debris until her fur was stained with a layer of pale dust. <em>Might be better to, maybe I can practice aiming for that snakeheart’s head.</em> no other cat ignited her rage so easily, and her mind was just so preoccupied with thoughts of the Dark Forest she-cat that she was acting uncharacteristically aloof and stand-offish. <strong>”Alright.”</strong> she murmured in acceptance of the tom’s offer, her claws sliding out of their sheaths as she approached the damp log that the tom had been using as a scratching post. <em>Deep breath, in…. And out…</em> she had to calm herself, to focus, a good warrior did not let their rage cloud their judgement in combat. She needed a clear mind, one that was free of thoughts of her adversaries, the mind of a veteran warrior such as herself.

And then, she swung her claws down at the log, shredding moist bark off of its surface. She might need more of these in the near future.

The rain of splinters ceased as she forced herself to stop raking her claws through the rough surface of the log, letting another series of deep inhales and exhales enter and leave her lungs. Laurelblaze stared down at the destruction she left behind, seeing the deep claw marks she had etched into the surface of the wet bark. She had always had a bit of a flair for the dramatic, and that extended to her temper. She was just glad she knew to vent it out in ways other than chewing other cats out and taking her anger out on them. They were not the cause, it wasn’t right to do so. Hence why various trees throughout the territory tended to have scars on their trunks from her previous venting sessions. Her victims were purely plants, thankfully.

Another huff left her lips, and she turned to face the tom for a moment as she felt the tension leave her frame for just a moment. Her spiked fur began to relax back to her sides to its normal unkempt state, and a less-hardened expression appeared upon her features. <strong>”Thanks, I had a lot on my mind lately and its just added up. Felt nice to actually blow off some steam.”</strong> she clearly had been letting off the stress that had accumulated in the past moon and a half, unleashing it all in a sudden burst of fury. Yet she knew it wouldn’t stop until they finally put an end to the treachery within the clan once and for all. <em>No one will harm my clanmates, especially not from one of their own.</em>

Beanspark smiled, feeling confident that Marigolddust had a great system of high ranks that had his back. A small pang of envy rang in his chest, but quickly vanished. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m so glad to hear that.&quot;</strong> He purred, looking around. As he stared at the landslides damage, a memory popped into his mind. One that brought a frown to his face. <strong>&quot;Oh, this reminds me...&quot;</strong> Beanspark pinned his ears back a bit before clearing his throat. He was hesitating because he didn&#39;t know how to talk about this...how would she react?

Her ears flickered for a moment, and she stared at the tom a bit in confusion. He’d let her basically destroy the log he offered her to sink her claws into for her own purposes. Why shouldn’t she thank him? <em>Strange… Won’t press him about it, though.</em> she shrugged her shoulders and moved on, not wishing to dwell on something so trivial and pointless. She could already see that if she tried to convince him that he should accept her praise, it would just go in circles. That’s how those types of conversations always went about for her anyways.

<strong>”I’m grateful for that.”</strong> his comment about her clanmates supporting her brought a sense of ease to her heart, but the thought of traitors among their ranks brought her anxiety. What more would they do to them? When would they finally reveal themselves?

<em>How many are going to be killed because of them?</em>

Her stomach sank at the thought, and she refused to allow it to happen. She had a duty to protect her clanmates, and that meant every single one of them. Her family was here, they all needed her protection. <strong>”Once everything settles down I’m sure I’ll be fine. Its just a lot for me right now. It’s like the fire all over again.”</strong> and back then, she was <em>freshly</em> promoted as a deputy in the aftermath of the blaze. Now she had been deputy for well over a year now, almost two, if she was counting her seasons correctly. <em>Next late leaf-bare will mark when I was promoted.</em>

<em><strong><em>- Past -</em></strong></em>

Marigolddust&#39;s own fur wasn&#39;t as dirty as Wrenpaw&#39;s was, as it was flatter and a but shorter.  His grey fur kept close to his body, more like a thin blanket rather than a fluffy, thermal one.  It kept him warm enough, but such short fur was bothersome when it came to colder temperatures.  It was just another reason why he wasn&#39;t at all fond of the cold, or leaf-bare.  The season really only brought him discomfort, even if Laurelblaze and quite a few others seemed to enjoy it so much.  Fortunately, though, such fur meant that the mud had difficulty getting under it.  It was difficult to get matted, and instead it usually only held a thin layer of crusted mud and dirt, not enough to be a real challenge to get out until the mud was dry.  Because of this, Marigolddust found it a bit difficult to try and imagine how much easier hardened mud would be to get out than wet mud.  Glancing up at the sky, Marigolddust tried to be asp onto some sort of response.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to stay rainy for much longer,&quot;</em></strong></em> he mentioned, content with the final decision of his words.  It was still fialry cloudy, but he could almost feel the rays of sunshine on his pelt again, like it had after the landslide.  Perhaps that was just him trying to hope, though.  Sometimes, and more often recently, he found himself forcing himself to hope for something good, so that maybe, just maybe that thing would happen.  It hadn&#39;t yet worked with Fernpaw.</span>

            It wasn&#39;t hard to tell that Wrenpaw felt guilty as soon as he had reacted to her words, and her feeling of guilt over him made he himself feel guilty himself.  It was odd, how feeling like guilt or shame could do things like that.. and it definitely didn&#39;t feel good.  It was a relief to see Wrenpaw begin to relax after he had given her the reassuring lick, although he could tell that shame still weighed down on her.  <em><strong><em>&quot;You weren&#39;t prying at all.  It&#39;s just... Weird, you know?  Sometimes things change, and we just have to go along with it.  It was just my thoughts prying at me, not you.  And.. And *please</em> don&#39;t feel like you have to do anything.  I can&#39;t be the only one mourning a loss, anyhow,&quot;*</strong></em> he said gently, truly hoping that the statements would be enough to do as he wished.  He didn&#39;t want Wrenpaw to feel like she should do anything, especially not on his part.  Just talking about it made him uncomfortable, but at the same time, he would rather not let Wrenpaw see that too clearly.  If only he could actually control his emotions, without letting it be the other way around.  Wrenpaw should have to feel the way she did now.</span>

Although his smile still held the afterlife of sadness, he nodded.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;m very excited to see how much of an amazing hunter you are now,&quot;</em></strong></em> he agreed, even though he wished that he hadn&#39;t had to miss watching her get better over the past few days.  It seemed so wrong, watching Wrenpaw enter camp with prey, but not with him by her side.  It was like she was already a warrior, and it was an understatement to say that he wasn&#39;t quite ready for that.  Sadness morphed into anxiety as his mind was brought back onto the topic of what he was here to tell.  Wrenpaw already seemed at unease.  That couldn&#39;t be a good thing, could it?  Adverting his gaze once again, Marigolddust tried not to stammer and remained unsuccessful.  <em><strong><em>&quot;W-well, we&#39;ll still be training just like we always do.  Accept.. I might not be as... *Free</em> with time after lessons, and we might have to cut sessions down a little bit at times.&quot;*</strong></em> He explained, and even he himself could tell that he was only trying to stall before giving the true announcement.

Icestar&#39;s reply came as that which was both expected yet unexpected at the same time. She had figured the older feline would disagree with her statement, perhaps confront her on the matter even. Such was more or less the case, but her next words - while having generally been expected - she didn&#39;t think they&#39;d affect her the way they ultimately did. Would those things happen to her? Surely not. She wasn&#39;t weak or anything like that! Mighty warriors didn&#39;t suffer such injuries...right?
    <strong>&quot;Well- What&#39;re you trying to say? It&#39;s not my fault so many others get injured. Maybe Thunderclan just needs to be stronger and not so weak. Weaklings as warriors certainly would make for a reasonable explanation to such a situation.&quot;</strong> She countered, in hopes to make herself feel better. Injuries happened because one was weak...surely. Well, that probably wasn&#39;t exactly true - but what else could it mean? Mistypaw shook her head, whiskers quivering. <strong>&quot;So, with that in mind, what if we make a deal? I&#39;ll come help you, but only for protection purposes. I gain whatever knowledge it is on what stinky herbs look like and you have help. Kinda. Does that satisfy you?&quot;</strong> Her odd-colored gaze flickered to the lynx-point, tail flicking about to and fro.

She did feel a bit relieved when he said that he didn’t feel like she was prying. She still couldn’t help but think he was just saying that to make her feel better, but she gave him a small smile anyways. Her amber eyes were full of sympathy as he spoke, and she tried to think about what it would be like to be in his situation. Wrenpaw had never experienced grief, and though she didn’t want to, it made it hard to understand exactly what her mentor was dealing with. She knew he was hurting, but she could never truly understand the depth of the pain and loss that he felt. She thought about what it would be like to lose one of her friends, or her kin, and the thought made her heart ache but it still wasn’t the same as <em>actually</em> losing one of them. Was did truly hurt though, was knowing someone she cared about was in pain and that there was nothing she could do. She shifted on her hindquarters, sighing softly. <strong>”Life is full of changes, I guess. Good ones and bad ones. I know I shouldn’t feel like I need to do anything, I just can’t help it. I just… always want to help everyone even though I know that’s not realistic,”</strong> she admitted. Perhaps she had known that all along, but she was just now realizing that she was helpless in the face of everyone’s problems. There was no solution, no matter how much she wished there was. 

She was happy when the subject returned to her hunting. He seemed genuinely excited to see how much she had improved, even if it had only been a pawful of days since she’d began hunting on her own. Of course she had already improved through practicing with Marigolddust during their training sessions, but the solo hunting seemed to have sharpened her skills even more. It was probably knowing that it was up to her to feed her clan and to bring back as much prey as possible. Motivation like that was enough to make any cat try their absolute hardest. It was also an excellent opportunity to prove herself to her clan, and perhaps it would bring her one step closer to her warrior ceremony. Sure, she knew she was a bit too young for that still, but she knew all of her hard work wouldn’t go unnoticed. She smiled. <strong>”Yeah, it’s great. I don’t get so nervous when I hunt now! I actually feel, like, confident I guess.”</strong> It had taken her quite some time to gain confidence in any of her skills because she was always so worried about not being good enough, but she felt different now. She believed in herself more, and it was a nice change. In some ways that felt like an even bigger deal than her improved skills. She used to think she always be unsure of herself, always doubtful of her abilities, but she didn’t really feel that way anymore. 

She tipped her head to the side, a confused look crossing her features. Why wouldn’t he have enough time? What could possibly make him so busy that he wouldn’t be able to dedicate time to their training sessions anymore? Now she was worried all over again, and her worrisome gaze stayed fixed on him as she waited for him to give some kind of reason or explanation, but he never did. <strong>”O-oh,”</strong> she said, sinking a canine into her lower lip. Had she done something wrong? He had seemed to excited to get back out into the forest with her, but now he was saying he wouldn’t have as much time.  <strong>”Can I ask why?”</strong> Disappointed amber eyes glanced around the clearing, and hope sprang in her chest as she thought she made a realization. Perhaps he would be busy with camp repairs? Even when the entrances were cleared and warriors could come and go again, they would still have a lot of rebuilding inside of the camp to do. Surely the clan needed their strongest warriors to help with that, right? That had to be the reason Marigolddust wouldn’t have as much time for training as before, but that was okay. It would only be temporary. That seemed like a reasonable explanation, right? So why was her anxiety</span>

There is no doubt that the two of them will continue to support Marigolddust furiously. They both already possessed a strong bond with him - Laurelblaze moreso than Icestar - and the new medicine cat will need all the help he could get. Fernpaw wasn’t going to be by his side anymore. Not as a medicine cat nor as a close friend. ThunderClan was affected greatly by her loss but Icestar had a feeling that the gentle gray-and-white tom was suffering the most.

Icestar’s expression grew more serious at Beanspark’s report. The last time the Clan suffered a herb shortage, a terrible outbreak of redcough ravaged a considerable amount of her Clanmates. To have an event like that happen again… 

A patrol out to the territories was out of the question. The mysterious murders had not been solved and while none of them were her Clanmates, Icestar wasn’t going to risk them becoming the next victims. 

<strong>” Did Marigolddust check the abandoned Twoleg Den?”</strong> The shelter should have spared most of the herbs from the worst of the storm, right?

<em><strong><em>- Past -</em></strong></em>

It was a bit tricky to see Wrenpaw&#39;s sympathy as a good thing, although he knew that she meant well.  He hated the fact that pity felt so uncomfortable when you were the one receiving it, but he couldn&#39;t help but live this fact now.  There was no doubt that he would react the same way if something this heartbreaking happened to Wrenpaw, but the attention wasn&#39;t something he was at all used to.  How might he feel if she went through this?  Perhaps if something happened to make Coyotepaw disappear would make her feel this way.  The brown tabby tom was like Wrenpaw&#39;s Fernpaw, wasn&#39;t he?  No, maybe they weren&#39;t that close yet... Marigolddust had only recently taken in the two apprentices&#39; close relationship, and wouldn&#39;t know how Wrenpaw would feel if her long-legged friend was gone.  How would <em>he</em> react to that?  He was supposed to be the one caring for others now, not the other way around, and Wrenpaw shouldn&#39;t be too worried anyways... right?  This was just a wave of sadness that would pass in no time.  Fernpaw was probably still out there somewhere, no matter how many times Laurelblaze might have used the word &quot;casualty&quot; in the same sentence as the sandalwood&#39;s name.  Why should he have to feel sad when he knew this, and knew that she would come back?  And he was confident that she would.  She had to.</span>

              <em><strong><em>&quot;it&#39;s nice of you to want to help others, and you should be as confident in yourself as I do.  You deserve it.&quot;</em></strong></em> Marigolddust said softly, his gaze mirroring a little bit of her sympathy, causing the reflection of the emotion to spring back at the honey toned fem.  He sometimes found himself feeling the same way, but now that that was his job, it wasn&#39;t such a bad trait.  But Wrenpaw&#39;s role in the clan wasn&#39;t specifically to find herbs and mend other&#39;s wounds, though.  And confidence was easily something that he had trouble with.  These new tasks of hers seemed to be effecting her in some positive ways, even if the fact might be buried by all of the misfortune that was brought onto the clan meanwhile.  

              <em>Why?</em>  The question seemed to echo as it bounced off of the walls of his mind, slicing through all other thoughts like claws through prey.  He knew the answer, of course; it had been bothering and pestering at him ever since his meeting with Icestar and Laurelblaze.  But saying it out loud, to a cat he cared about as dearly as he did Wrenpaw... that seemed like a greater task that he wasn&#39;t sure he was capable of completing.  <em>You never know what might come unless you try,</em> he thought quietly to himself, hoping that the quote would keep him from shying away from his goal.  She would find out, anyways, so what was he so worried about?  He had nothing that he could hide, and this would hopefully just soften the blow for his appretnice.  Yet his anxiety didn&#39;t leave him, even as he brought together the words.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, we need a replacement for Fernpaw,&quot;</em></strong></em> he started, the word <em>&#39;replacement&#39;</em> almost making him flinch as he said it, <em><strong><em>&quot;And I&#39;ve agreed to take that place.&quot;</em></strong></em>

His statement only made her feel a prickle of guilt, her clanmates were blissfully unaware of what was at stake here. An internal war was happening, where clanmates were being turned against one another in the midst of a crisis. All because of a cat she once trusted, one she let into their clan under the guise she was going to redeem herself. The cat who went on a rampage in their camp, causing the deaths of two of their clanmates, and is only continuing her campaign of revenge and chaos. A cat she once considered a friend, a cat she’d abandoned for the sake of her clan. Laurelblaze battled with herself often, especially lately, if that decision was truly for the best, if she’d just stuck around a little longer that her friend would have truly changed. Maybe more cats would have survived, maybe this could have been averted… Maybe-

<em>Stop, stop it right now.</em>

She internally chastised herself for those thoughts, the belligerent demonization of her own actions. The deputy had to accept she could not alter the course of fate, that she could not have seen into the future and understood what actions the other tortoiseshell would have taken. She couldn’t have prevented it, and that was what she hated most— what struck the most fear into her. She and Silentwing were once birds of a feather, fiercely devoted to their respective clans, but the other’s devotion led her down a dark path where she eventually spiraled. <em>It petrified her</em>, Laurelblaze loved her clan dearly, and wanted nothing but the absolute best for them… Yet she feared if she took a wrong course of action that it’d lead her down the same path, the same demise. It was one of her greatest fears.

<em>I can’t. I can’t let that happen.</em>

<strong>”You’re right about that, but this has seriously hampered our efforts to prepare for leaf-bare.”</strong> she was distracting herself with conversation, but these thoughts still plagued her. No amount of damp logs she could rake her claws through could cause her to shake this feeling of absolute dread. Laurelblaze needed to put a stop to this conflict and quick, she couldn’t allow her clanmates to continue to suffer.

The sun was high in the sky as the ThunderClan deputy sat back and inspected the progress on the repairs going on around camp. Many of the dens had been gutted of dirt and debris, but were hardly inhabitable as they were still falling apart from the damage they suffered from the storm. They needed supplies to truly begin reconstructing each den, as they clearly did not have enough to progress in their efforts of refurbishing their damaged camp. Hence why she was here now, calling together a patrol to begin gathering supplies for the reconstruction of their dens. Clearing her throat, Laurelblaze called out for the cats she wanted on this patrol: <strong>”Hollowgrove, Jayfang, Patchheart! I need you three to go on a patrol to gather supplies for the dens.”</strong> she called for the trio to show themselves, and her request was simple enough. All they had to gather were sticks, ferns, moss, anything they could get their paws on and use for the dens.

The white and ginger she-cat pricked her ears up as she heard her aunts call from across the camp. She rose to her feet, stretching, before she padded over to the deputy, orange eyes looking determined.  
<strong>&quot;Den supplies. That seems easy enough!&quot;</strong> she mewed, smiling kindly as she turned and looked for Jayfang and Hollowgrove to join her. <strong>&quot;Definitely important. Hopefully we can get these dens rebuilt before leafbare truly sets in.&quot;</strong> she mewed to Laurelblaze,  concern in her eyes as she looked around at the mess of their camp once more.</span>

Jayfang was alive. Was he doing well? No. But he was alive, at least. Mud stains were still dappled in his silver pelt - a very unusual thing to happen, as he took a lot of pride in it. However, he never liked water, and with all the things that happened, he wasn&#39;t exactly caring about most things. With a huff, the short-haired tom rose to his paws from one of the corners of camp, turning his head over to Laurelblaze. &quot;Me, on a patrol,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Last time I went on an assigned patrol, we found dead bodies. What will we find now?&quot; But, as he neared, it seemed it was just to gather supplies. As a bonus, no one heard his remark. He slowed to a stop gradually, his tail dragging on the floor in a sort of sad - yet also irritated - way. &quot;Let&#39;s get a move on, then.&quot;

The braided tabby was currently lounging in camp, violet eyes retaining little to no emotion, nothing that would betray the inner turmoil among her thoughts. Tufted ears twitched as her gaze slowly drifted skyward, the heavens above much too cheerful for her liking. Returning her attention to that which was laid out before her, the dark-furred tabby let out a breath. Things were particularly slow today, but should she expect much else out of her fellow Thunderclanners? They seemed reluctant to do much as of late...as if their very spirits had been surrounded by mud and debris, trapped among it as their entire camp had been not too long ago. Sometimes, it took forever for one to move on...but for the warrioress, she found such to be draining and of no use to her. Then again, she&#39;d never been the sentimental type to begin with.
    Her thoughts were broken by the call of Laurelblaze, Thunderclan&#39;s beloved deputy. The large tortoiseshell had called for her, alongside two others. <em>Supplies? Certainly, no such thing is needed. A waste of time.</em> The braided warrior arose from her spot nonetheless. She would not complain verbally - she&#39;d be instantly confronted on the matter. Much of their supplies had been destroyed after the mudslide, so of course, they&#39;d need to find new ones. Even so...she couldn&#39;t help but believe that their search would end in vain. Once reaching the trio, her gaze flickered over each feline yet otherwise, remained silent for a few moments. <strong>&quot;Let us not rush things. Missing that which is important to us now, is not what is needed. At the same time...let us not raise our hopes. With leaf-bare upon us, I doubt we&#39;ll find much - if anything.&quot;</strong>

All of the cats she’d summoned with her cry appeared swiftly, much to her appreciation. Though she couldn’t blame Jayfang for his reaction, she’d make it up to him for that last patrol he was on. It wasn’t exactly the most pleasant to be on. <strong>”I pray you all don’t find any more, StarClan forbid we have another problem at hand.”</strong> she shook her head with a small sigh, casting a sympathetic look to the younger tom. She too would have a bad taste left in her mouth if it happened <em>again</em>. Today, however, their task was simple.

Hollowgrove’s comment made her whiskers twitch, and the deputy stared at the other two cats intently. <strong>”Whatever you can find, bring it here swiftly. We need actual shelters to house our warriors.”</strong> she was curt, and very quick to shut down the notion that they wouldn’t find supplies. <strong>”Might I remind all of you that leaf-bare is not for at least a moon and a half- we should still be able to find supplies for our dens. I expect results, now get going.”</strong> it took some impressive willpower on her end to force her fur to not prickle. She was on edge upon learning that traitors lurked within their walls, and she was not going to tolerate it. Yet she couldn’t go openly accusing them, not yet anyhow. They needed to be ready first, and quick. <strong>”Be careful while you’re out there.”</strong>

(Sorry for the delay! I took a nap before work D:)

The white and ginger she-cat raised a brow at her fellow patrol mates comments, mouth a flat line as she thought they sounded negative. She gave a small sigh, but brightened up at Laurelblazes words. She gave a deep nod, orange eyes gleaming with determination.  

<strong>&quot;Come on guys, we can do this! Im sure the landslide knocked down some branches and such that we can use to help rebuild the dens!&quot;</strong> she gave a smile, trying to stay as positive as she could. <strong>&quot;We&#39;ll of course be careful too.&quot;</strong> she mewed, smiling understandabley at her aunt. <strong>&quot;Lets get going. Those supplies arent gonna find themselves!&quot;</strong> she chirped, turning and padding towards the entrance of the camp.</span>

As expected, her words had been countered with that of kit-like optimism. Hope somehow remained among them, perhaps merely to retain their sanity. The braided tabby found this...amusing yet disheartening at the same time. How easy it was for one&#39;s mind to be betrayed by their emotions, clouding their better judgement. Perhaps she&#39;d be deemed simply pessimistic, her own thoughts lacking that sliver of hope Laurelblaze and Patchheart seemed to harbor. Or perhaps, they were merely believing the lies they told themselves, in an attempt to ward off any doubts or concerns that lingered nearby. Whatever the case, she admired their consistency in doing so...however disappointing it might be in the end.
    Her ears twitched at Patchheart&#39;s reply, following in tune with that of the tortoiseshell&#39;s. She clicked her tongue yet made no immediate reply, a mere rolling of her eyes serving as the only response to the felines. As the bi-color tabby padded towards the camp entrance, the warrior spared a glance toward the tom, Jayfang, before following after the opposing warrior. <strong>&quot;Let us get this over with. We&#39;ll discover who&#39;s right soon enough.&quot;</strong> Long tail sweeping over the earth, the molly&#39;s long stride swiftly carried her onward. Onward toward what was to come.

His ears twitched and he raised an eyebrow. <em>Not rush?</em> The last time he hadn&#39;t rushed, someone <em>died</em>. &quot;Yeah, right. As if we&#39;re taking it slow to repair the camp we literally live in.&quot; He flicked his tail impatiently. &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s just go already!&quot;

As if on cue, Patchheart agreed. Jayfang nodded to her sentences, but staying true to his ever-so-pessimistic behavior, he had a snappy remark ready. &quot;A landslide - in our camp - knocked down branches?&quot; The logic was faulty. Optimists and their horrible thinking skills... The silver-pelted tom jerked his muzzle towards the exit. &quot;Even though there won&#39;t be branches just waiting on the ground, we should still look for supplies. I&#39;m not sleeping in a den that&#39;s falling apart,&quot; he huffed, eyes narrowed. 

When Hollowgrove began moving, he ran forward, his paws drumming lightly against the ground. &quot;Great StarClan, you guys are slow,&quot; he sighed exasperatedly as he passed the other two warriors on the patrol. &quot;Follow me.&quot;

<em>Is that so?</em> Icestar wished to question but Mistypaw hurried on to suggest that she was willing to <em>watch</em> her pick the herbs needed for Marigolddust. Her tail flicked from side to side, considering the apprentice’s words. She wished to argue against them - her whole body sizzled with anticipation to do so - but the day wasn’t going to stop for them and early morning was the best time to pick these precious plants.

<strong>” It doesn’t satisfy me,”</strong> the lynx-point replied honestly. <strong>” But it’ll have to do.”</strong> It was better than outright refusing to help however, Icestar was an ambition femme. Mistypaw participating, even like this, fit nicely into her own schemes. 

 <em>Now all it needs to do is work.</em> 

<strong>” After you,”</strong> she gestured towards the thorn tunnel. <strong>” We’re heading to the abandoned Twoleg Den first.”</strong> There must be some that could be salvaged from the destroyed territory.

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Ever since Beanspark had visited him, Marigolddust knew that, despite his increasing desire to keep it secret, he had to let it slip that he didn&#39;t have nearly as many herbs as he needed to have.  Even Benspark said how bad it was, and Marigolddust knew that the other medicine cat was a kind one.  If he showed so much concern, then there was no doubt that Thunderclan needed help.  And, in the end, that meant that Marigolddust needed it, too.  His pitiful pile of basic herbs had improved a little bit ever since Beanspark&#39;s visit, growing both in size and variety, but it was still much too small.  Marigolddust appreciated the cats who had helped him with his search as of recent more than they might know, all of them; Laurelblaze, Icestar, Beanspark, and a few others that the three had convinced to assist them.  Marigolddust had yet to bring himself to do the same action.  He felt terrible, asking cats who might have enough troubles as it was, help him.  It made him feel guilty, admitting such a large weakness in the clan.  He wanted to keep the fact that, if the clan continued like this herb-wise, they would be neck-deep in troubles, such troubles <em>not</em> including everything else.  He could almost imagine all of his clanmate&#39;s heads being pushed under the water of their hardships. 
 
That&#39;s why he wanted to change his lack of finding assistance today.</span>

The stormy-toned tux found himself out in the camp rather than kept in his den like he had been as of recent.  His golden gaze traced where rubble had been not long before, a spark of excited hope starting in him as he realized how much progress they had made.  Usually, he would have considered the amount of clean-up as a very small percentage of what work was ahead of them, but recently he had found himself unable to do so.  Every small step seemed like a huge leap to the tom&#39;s eyes since all of the destruction first struck the large band of cats, and his happiness over the progress sometimes managed to cloud over his doubt.  Giving his head a quick shake, Marigolddust dragged his eyes off of the walls of the camp and the surrounding dens.  He wasn&#39;t supposed to be focusing on that- he had more important matters to try and figure out.  

But for some reason, he found it to be so hard to try and walk up to strangers, asking them for help.  He was the one who was given this rank, so wasn&#39;t he the one who was supposed to be able to handle it?  That was how this all worked, wasn&#39;t it?  How bad would it be of him, going around and asking a bunch of warriors and apprentices for some help with the job he agreed to do?  He managed to break through the hesitance with a forced pawstep forwards, and more followed soon after.  He continued like this as he crossed the camp, before his eyes landed on a certain fem who didn&#39;t seem very content or focused on a specific task.  He recognized her a little bit, but he still had to work on memorizing everyone&#39;s names.  If only he had practiced the idea more before he took all of this on.</span>

Reluctantly, he padded up to the warrior.  <em><strong><em>&quot;U-um.. hello, are you busy..?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked, his voice almost a whisper as he tried to fight off his nerves.  Oh, hopefully that hadn&#39;t been too rude of a hello- had he gone too fast?  He could sometimes do that when his anxiety got the best of him.  Maybe just the simple &quot;hello&quot; would have been fine.  Why in Starclan&#39;s name was he so nervous?

Nectarglade looked up, adjusting her position to see with her one good eye. before her stood Marigolddust, she hadn&#39;t known the tom very well, so it was a bit of a surprise. <strong>&quot;oh, well no, not in particular&quot;</strong> she said, mustering up all the strength in her voice that she could, though in reality, all she wanted to do was collapse in a nice warm den, away from all the troubles of camp. <strong>&quot;why what do you need?&quot;</strong> she said in just the same cheery voice

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

<em><strong><em>&quot;Nothing much- just wondering if you&#39;d mind assisting me... With collecting herbs and whatnot,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, trying not to rub a paw against the other in an attempt to try and avoid the awkward feeling that he could feel growing in his own chest.  It was nothing much to do with Nectarglade, but more with his own worries that never seemed to silence.  He couldn&#39;t help but feel that he was being rude with every word he spoke, but why was that?  These doubts as to whether or not he was being polite enough bothered him too much, causing him to instinctively add a little bit more to his original statement.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I can ask someone else, though, if you&#39;d rather not, I&#39;m just looking for any extra paws to carry some herbs.&quot;</em></strong></em>  He added, speaking a bit quicker as he spoke.  He wasn&#39;t used to these type of things, and had been feeling too emotional recently to react to such things rationally.</span>

              Sure, it might not hurt anybody else, him being increasingly anxious and all, but every emotion he felt felt as if it were elevated to a higher, unnecessary level.  He had been feeling too sad, too scared, too doubtful, too aggravated at himself- the only emotion he couldn&#39;t find or strengthen as much was relief or relaxation, but hopefully a little trip out of the camp with company would help to change that.  He had only really gone out herb hunting with Fernpaw and Beanspark, and Fernpaw was gone and Beanspark was away, leaving him fairly lonely.  He was so used Fernpaw sharing the medicine cat&#39;s den with him that now that he had it to himself, besides a larger amount of patience than he had ever seen in the den, he felt more independent and grief ridden than he wished.  Cats had visited his den often since he had became the medicine cat of Thunderclan, coming with news, coming to check in, coming to see friends and family, coming to drop off some herbs... But he knew that their visits would steadily decrease the better the condition of the camp became.</span>

               When that would be, though, he was unsure.  The business with Silentwing that Icestar and Laurelblaze had informed him about made him far too fearful for his own good.  That was another reason he wanted company when going out to collect herbs.  They had informed him of the vengeful dark forest fem and Beetlestreak&#39;s undeserved end, warning him to be prepared to protect himself if necessary.  Unfortunately, Marigolddust want known for his strength <em>or</em> his fighting skills, and the chances he had against such a cat were low to zero.  So, the most he could really do is be on his guard when he slept (which hasn&#39;t been at all easy, considering his lack of sleep from both fear of Silentwing and grief over Fernpaw) and always have some sort of cat nearby.  Of course he wouldn&#39;t tell Nectarglade about this, though; he was forbidden to.  Plus, nobody else needed to know that the clan was only getting in more and more trouble.

Nectarglade listened to the tom, though he seemed... distracted? fearful? what for? <strong>&quot;well sure!&quot;</strong> she said kindly. <strong>&quot;though, ummm... are you okay? you seem...fidgety? nervous? is something wrong?&quot;</strong>, she didn&#39;t like when her clanmates seemed upset, it worried her.

Beanspark twitched his ear, thinking on the question. <strong>&quot;I...honestly don&#39;t know.

With all this going on I...didn&#39;t even think to ask.&quot;</strong> He pinned his ears back, looking at the ground. He honestly didn&#39;t even know ThunderClan had such a place on their territory. Beanspark was suddenly overwhelmed with the feeling that he had no idea what he was doing.

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

A pleasant feeling of relief settled over Marigolddust as Nectarglade agreed to his request, although his new, more confident smile faltered for just a moment at her question.  Quickly, his expression turned from that of relief to that of reassurance that might have seemed a bit too desperate in the eyes of any cat mindful enough to take notice of it.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Thank you!  It&#39;s very appreciated, I promise.  And of course, I&#39;m fine- it&#39;s probably just the sickness through camp that&#39;s making me seem that way,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, trying hard to wipe all of his previous nervousness off of his features.  Nectarglade meant the question in good nature, of course, but some cats, including himself, couldn&#39;t quite help it; it was a bit tricky, being anxious and worried all of the time, and that trait combined with that of unnecessary humiliation didn&#39;t make a very good combination when it came to them being recognized.  He felt as if he should put on a stronger demeanor as the medicine cat, and as a Thunderclanner in general.  Even now he felt embarrassed over the fact that he had let the fact that he was feeling so figity at the moment slip.  But, of course, he would use all of his power to keep this from being shown, even if he wasn&#39;t the best at it.</span>

            One such attempt was his urge to change the topic.  And, of course, he appeased this want.  Standing, he turned partway and beckoned for Nectarglade to follow.  <em><strong><em>&quot;You can just follow me, if you&#39;d like- I can just describe to you what we need, unless you know what certain herbs like marigold, catnip, chamomile, and poppy look like?&quot;</em></strong></em> He offered, staring the last part half like a question rather than a statement.  He honestly had no idea what knowledge other cats had on topics such as herbs, and he didn&#39;t wish to make Nectarglade feel as if he were being rude and claiming she was unintelligent by telling her what she already knew.  If the case we&#39;re different, though, and she did end up not knowing different herbs, then he would like to take the chance to try and show her some.  The more cats around that knew how to recognize the healing plants, the better.  That way, if anything were to happen to him- which he won&#39;t worry himself over the topic right now- they had backup, and there could be more paws present to collect herbs.  Starclan knows how many herbs they needed- they were less than unprepared for the coming season of leaf-bare.

The pitiful state that Beanspark had transitioned in struck a chord in her heart. <strong>” It’s okay,”</strong> she assured. <strong>” Obviously, you are more familiar with SkyClan’s territory.”</strong> She tried for an amused comment, a half-smile playing at the edge of her lips. It fell as the medicine cat’s disheartened expression was as visible as ever. How could he have known about the abandoned Twoleg Den? He was no ThunderClan cat.

<strong>” Don’t place impossible expectations upon yourself,”</strong> Icestar said gently. <strong>” If you have time, why don’t we go together to see what state it’s in,”</strong> she suggested. Marigolddust was probably busy settling into his new den.  <strong>” And next time, you’ll be able to know where it is,”</strong> the lynx-point gave a playful wink. She then stood up from her spot and gave her pelt a satisfying shake. With her fur all ruffled, she was ready to venture in the wilderness.

Beanspark very slowly backed out of the medicine cat&#39;s den, letting out a sigh of relief as he cleared the entrance. Marigolddust had finally fallen asleep while Beanspark ran out to grab some chamomile. The medicine cat had been struggling to relax and rest, which Beanspark understood completely. But he also stressed self care, <em>especially</em> for medicine cats. You can&#39;t treat a sick cat when you&#39;re sick yourself. 

Beanspark sat down and closed his eyes, his nose pointing towards the stars. With a smile on his face, he sent several prayers to starclan requesting their protection. It was a moment of calm, bliss, and silence...

Which was quickly interrupted. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> [sorry I totally forgot sobs]</span>

The ThunderClan deputy for the most part had been overseeing repair efforts on the camp, and despite the fact that one of their most recent hauls of supplies had gone <em>missing</em> in the past few days, she knew something was amiss. They had traitors within their walls, and considering they were hosting a medicine cat from a neighboring clan in their disheveled camp— the deputy wasn’t exactly happy about the situation to say the least. It was taking much of her self-control not to round up all of the traitors at once and give them a punishment worth the crime, but she had to wait— they had to draw Silentwing and her coconspirator out. They were the real threat here, and she wasn’t going to let the other clans take advantage of her own in their time of weakness. Not when they still needed to replenish their strength and the supplies for their camp.

Besides that, there was another matter she was concerned about with Beanspark’s presence in their camp— Marigolddust’s training. She considered the gray tuxedo tom a good friend of hers, and she wanted to know how he was faring in his education as a medicine cat. She understood the transition from the role of a warrior to that of a healer was not smooth for most, thus she felt obligated to check and see how her clanmate was doing… By grilling his mentor with questions.

<strong>”Beanspark.”</strong> she approached the much smaller SkyClanner, practically towering over him. <strong>”We need to talk.”</strong>

Very foreboding indeed.

Beanspark&#39;s moment was destroyed and his prayer interrupted. His fur lifted as he turned angrily to the rude ThunderClanner. It was less anger for him, though, and more anger for his friend. <strong>&quot;Shh!&quot;</strong> He hissed, motioning towards the medicine cat&#39;s den. <strong>&quot;We can take this elsewhere. I won&#39;t have his well-deserved rest interrupted.&quot;</strong> Beanspark&#39;s hiss was stern, but not cruel. He sort of surprised himself with how assertive he was being. Hearing a flash of Specklerose in his own tone made some of his annoyance dissipate, but that didn&#39;t stop his tail from twitching irritably as he walked away from the den. 

Turning back to the deputy with a deep breath, his annoyance melting off of him, he gave her a smile. <strong>&quot;Sorry about that. He hasn&#39;t slept in a while...he really needs it. Now, what did you need?&quot;</strong> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

The burly deputy of ThunderClan was taken aback by the harshness of the SkyClan medicine cat’s tone, her ears flickering as she stared down at him in a mixture of shock and suspicion. <strong>”I’m not looking to interrupt his rest.”</strong> she glanced inside the entrance of the medicine cat den to see the sleeping form of Marigolddust, before she looked back to Beanspark. <strong>”But I wanted to talk to you about Marigolddust’s training.”</strong> she didn’t return the easygoing smile he flashed up at her yet, her gaze narrowing as she prepared her first line of questioning. She knew better than to threaten a medicine cat, but she wasn’t going to let him toy with her clanmate if she could help it. He was a guest in <em>ThunderClan’s</em> camp, he was quite a ways away from his home in SkyClan’s gorge.

<strong>”I hope everything is going well with him. Is he taking to his new role?”</strong> she stood up taller, puffing out her chest as she carried herself with great dignity and strength. She was not going to betray weakness, even in the face of adversity. <strong>”Marigolddust is my friend, and I want to make sure he’s doing all right. Speaking of which…”</strong> her gaze darkened, and she leaned in a bit closer, a steely expression forming across her features. <strong>”…If you mistreat him in any way, I will know.”</strong>

Beanspark looked over at his sleeping form, worry etched across his gaze. It wasn&#39;t until Laurelblaze made her threat that he returned to meet her dark gaze with his own steel one. His smile vanished with a small twitch of his eye. Beanspark had been threatened by big, mean cats enough in his life. He wasn&#39;t scared of them anymore. 

<strong>&quot;I don&#39;t expect you to know this, Laurelblaze, but medicine cats don&#39;t see borders. We&#39;re family, each of us. If I ever mistreated him, I would face the wrath of <em>my own</em> mind, let alone all of the other medicine cats. But that also means we&#39;ll all know if <em>you</em> mistreat him.&quot;</strong> His gaze turned sharp and his tail lashed. <strong>&quot;Just because we are medicine cats doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re able to be physically intimidated.&quot;</strong> Beanspark, despite his heart racing in fear, wasn&#39;t going to let her get to him like this. He stood his ground firmly, not letting an ounce of insecurity enter his stance, voice, or gaze despite him feeling it in every inch. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

Her pupils narrowed even more, but she cracked a small smirk at the attitude this tom carried with him. <strong>”Just remember he is my clanmate first, I’d never bring harm to him or allow it to come within a few meters of his presence.”</strong> she took a step back, taking a deep breath as she glanced over towards Marigolddust yet again. Even when he was a warrior they became friends, in a way she saw him almost like kin in her eyes. She was clearly being protective over him, not out of mistrust in the other clans, but as a good friend should be. Laurelblaze was loyal to her clan, and by extension, her clanmates. 

<strong>”I have faith Marigolddust will turn out to be one of the very best of your ranks as medicine cats. Just know that I am always watching out for him, just like I am always watching out for all of my clanmates.”</strong> her posture remained firm, and she was unyielding in the fact she was still going to fiercely protect Marigolddust if it came down to it. Laurelblaze was just that determined to do so.

The initial emotion that washed over the caramel apprentice was shock. Marigolddust was ThunderClan’s new medicine cat? It wasn’t like Wrenpaw didn’t think he was a good option for the clan’s new medic, the news had just caught her by surprise. It was the last thing the apprentice had been expecting to hear, but still, she thought StarClan had made the right call. Marigolddust surely would make a fine medicine cat. He was kind and caring, and no doubt smart enough to learn all the herbs. Still, Wrenpaw wasn’t sure exactly how to feel about the news. She was happy for the tom of course because serving the clan in this way was a great honor and a very crucial role to clan life. On the other paw, a bit of sadness swept over her because her mentor was traveling down a new path without her. She had always looked forward to the day where she would become a warrior just like him, and they would be warriors together. Now that was all changing, but she had to remind herself not to be selfish. This wasn’t really about her, it was about Marigolddust. He deserved nothing but her full support and happiness on the subject. A smile parted her lips, so broad that her teeth showed. <strong>”Oh, Marigolddust that’s great news! You’ll be a wonderful medicine cat,”</strong> she purred, flicking him softly with a white tipped tail. Her words had been true, and though other thoughts were threatening threatening her mind, she kept a happy expression. 

He had said that he would still be training her until she became a warrior, but was that really a wise decision on his part? Would he truly have time for his new duties as a medicine cat <em>and</em> training Wrenpaw to become a warrior? Being a mentor already seemed like a great task, she wasn’t sure how he could manage that and learning everything there was to know about being a medicine cat at the same time. Of course Wrenpaw would never doubt him or his abilities, but she was afraid of becoming a burden to him. What if he became stressed out and exhausted and it was all her fault? She would have to train extra hard during their sessions and make sure to practice everything she learned on her own time when he was doing medicine cat things. Surely his levels of stress would remain low if she could ensure that her training was easy for him. <strong>”Are you sure you want to finish my training? I mean, of course I wouldn’t <em>want</em> to be trained by anyone else but you, but… that seems like a lot of work. I don’t want to stress you out,”</strong> she said, shuffling  brown and white paws across the rock she sat on.

With her companions having departed, the feline merely waited until all eyes were busy elsewhere. The braided tabby turned to the gathered supplies, placing the sticks and bramble upon the moss she&#39;d gathered herself. Carefully, she folded the moss over, which would make it easy to carry. Now, it was simply time to rid of it all. But she&#39;d do it a bit differently, this time. Shoving the gathered supplies aside, Hollowgrove made her way through the camp, searching for a particular apprentice. She called her once or twice, but refrained from doing so excessively - the less attention, the better. It would be nice to have a paw to aid her for once...perhaps a rare thing, such bonds were good for in the slightest.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Tigerpaw had been hunting non stop since her excursion, trying to make up to Laurelblaze and the clan. She knew the torbie deputy still didn&#39;t fully trust her yet, but was too busy to keep an eye on her constantly. Slowly, she had also begun to recover from her breakup with Juniperpaw, so now as she brought a bunny to camp, she walked with a small skip in her step despite the long hours.

It was a familiar voice that called her from her thoughts, and Tigerpaw perked up to look for the source. Hollowgrove? <em>She&#39;s looking for me?</em> To be honest her mother intimidated her slightly - a stern warrior of few words and who never really wanted to be a queen - but she was the only family she had, and was pleased to be worthy of her attention for once. The brown tabby skipped over to her surrogate.

<strong>&quot;Hi Hollowgrove!&quot;</strong> &#39;Mom&#39; was out of the question. <strong>&quot;Y-you called me? What&#39;s up!&quot;</strong> Her purr was nervous as she stood before the warrior, pink eyes blinking expectantly. <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span></span>

Perhaps her final words hadn&#39;t been true after all. It seemed as if it took forever for the young feline to appear, bounding toward her after tossing her catch aside. The apprentice was hardly found among the camp as of late, instead tending to a workload of duties for a reason she did not know. Such didn&#39;t phase her. She had a task to tend to and whatever her own daughter&#39;s doings were, they were significantly less important.
    Violet eyes fell upon that of the form of the young molly, who approached her with a nature which was less than pleasing. She seemed slightly uncomfortable in her presence, yet respectful all the same. She could hardly care about her true opinions concerning herself, as in the end they meant nothing to her. If she had formed a negative image of herself in Tigerpaw&#39;s mind, then so be it. It was her own fault that she failed to follow in her pawsteps, running off after the life of a devoted warrior. Only Laurelblaze was to blame for such, ruining her. But now, it was time for her own bit of training.
    <strong>&quot;Yes. As a matter of fact, I have a task for you. I&#39;ve gathered some bedding which needs to be discarded upon at once.&quot;</strong> She kept her voice low, as not to draw attention to the pair. She began leading the molly toward the gathered supplies, which laid in a small pile near the camp entrance. <strong>&quot;The bedding is hardly usable. It has seen the last of it&#39;s days...care to assist me in taking care of it?&quot;</strong> The final part of that sentence was the hardest to choke out, but she managed, nonetheless.

The molly&#39;s ears twitched at the apprentice&#39;s reply, as she began to move toward the pile of supplies, in hopes of moving to a more secluded spot. But before she could even begin to pick it up, a question came from Tigerpaw. She was just about to answer, before the apprentice mentioned taking it to Marigolddust. That&#39;d ruin it entirely. <strong>&quot;No.&quot;</strong> She replied quickly, eyes narrowing. <strong>&quot;Can&#39;t you smell it? Oh that&#39;s right...you lost your sense of smell ages ago. Perhaps such is why you believe this can be saved. It cannot, we don&#39;t need to bother that sorry excuse of a medicine cat over old bedding. Did you want to help or just criticize my actions?&quot;</strong> With that, the tabby grabbed the bedding, heading toward the entrance to one of the dens. The warriors den at least was empty during this time of day, with everyone being out and about. They&#39;d return as if carrying away old bedding, instead of destroyed supplies. She didn&#39;t even bother waiting for Tigerpaw, if she decided not to come then she&#39;d merely do it without her.

The sun shone down cheerfully upon those of Thunderclan, dancing about upon the land below, casting a warm, golden light upon the earth and the creatures among it. Such was a welcoming delight - when compared to the chilly air that surrounded them, a moment of warmth was much appreciated. Such was a treasured moment for many, especially after drastic events, things seemed to have generally returned to normal...save for the underlying sense of tension, that is.
    Working alongside her comrades hadn&#39;t been easy, as a matter of fact, she&#39;d done her best to avoid doing so altogether. If she could help it, anyway. At times, there was no way out of aiding her companions in the darkness, in that which had lurked in the shadows, unknown to the public. For now. Hollowgrove knew that in due time, they&#39;d unleash their true power upon those around them. And then, they&#39;d fall, their fate resting in the paws of the very group who&#39;d caused such destruction. It would be a day that would be remembered for ages, for moons upon moons, generation upon generation. They&#39;d be a force to be reckoned with...a force which demanded upmost respect

But today would not be that day. As she entered the camp, a bird was clamped between her jaws. Violet gaze hovered over the camp briefly, as if considering whether or not to set her catch among the fresh-kill pile or not. Instead, the tabby turned away, heading toward the mouth of the medicine cat den. Dropping her prey, her voice rumbled, tumbling down the entrance. <strong>&quot;Marigolddust.&quot;</strong> Came a simple word, as she turned away. Perhaps, he was out doing...healer things. She had no need for herbs and the like...merely, a word or two.

 <em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Despite the rather beautiful day today, or at least during the season of leaf-fall, Marigolddust couldn&#39;t be found out in the camp enjoying it.  No, instead he was busy in his own den, fairly deep into it for that matter.  He had too many herbs to recognize, too many to learn- there was no chance he would give himself the time to take in the sun&#39;s rays when there was so much work needed to be done.  Ever since the landslide, <em>everything</em> had been destroyed.  Now, his den was fairly intact, just a bit muddy with small piles of rubble at select areas.  His herb storage was no longer empty, but it was still too sparse to leave be.  He no longer had only the basic herbs, but his gaze was widened a bit with Beanspark&#39;s teachings.  Now he had new herbs in his paws, and he was spending the time now to try and learn them; mallow leaves, juniper berries, and more.  It was all going to be more useful than the medicine cat might yet understand, and that was exactly what he was trying to do now.  

                  Suddenly, a voice joined his ears.  Perking the large stylites, he tried to recognize it.  It was faintly familiar, although he couldn&#39;t quite pinpoint which of his clanmates&#39; it belong to.  Standing, he gently set down the herbs he was busy with back onto their proper shelves, before turning and padding up to the enterance of his den.  As he spotted the peculiarly patterned fem, her na!e didn&#39;t take long to come to mind, surprisingly.  <em>Hollowgrove,</em> he remembered, before feeling a hit of panic as he realized his clanmate was turning to leave.  There must have been a reason for her coming here, and it was rude to leave her hanging, especially with his new rank.</span>

He wasn&#39;t used to attention like this, or much attention at all.  He wasn&#39;t sure whether he should be pleased or ashamed that a cat would feel interested in giving him prey, even if he had been receiving such donations quite a lot recently.  It always made him feel the same nonetheless, although he was grateful every time.

<strong>&quot;Umm, well yes, I think I do? minorly... though it would never hurt to continue learning!&quot;</strong> the she-cat declared, with a nod of her head, her one lazy ear flopping as she did so. <strong>&quot;you know, most warriors are too prideful to realize, there&#39;s always more to learn about like, about ourselves, the world around us, well-- <em>everything</em> really, &#39;there&#39;s always more to learn if you simply seek the answers&#39; that&#39;s what i like to say! wouldn&#39;t you agree?&quot;</strong> Nectarglade continued, trying to see if she could make a genuine smile form on the tom&#39;s face.

 <strong>&quot;so. where should we start? what are the herbs we need most? and where would we find them?&quot;</strong> she asked, and already her paws began carrying her to the camp entrance.

With the current situation of traitors invading their clan’s walls, one particular issue had cropped up that had been causing the deputy increased distress. One of said traitors was mentoring one of her own kits, Tigerpaw, and she was worried, <em>frantic</em> that her daughter was safe, that she didn’t know anything she wasn’t supposed to know. Laurelblaze wanted to protect her kits equally, and with Featherpaw injured she found it increasingly harder on her. The pressure was adding up, and she longed for the day they could be free of this torment, this constant struggle. Laurelblaze wasn’t going to cave in, she couldn’t.

But that didn’t stop her from being a concerned and responsible parent, even if her kits were apprentice-aged by now.

Her ears flickered as she peered around the gradually repaired clearing, dens were looking much better than before, but nothing was perfect. The lack of supplies to restore each of the dens was showing through. They were doing the bare minimum to keep the dens <em>stable</em>, let alone hospitable for the elements. The one den that was lucky enough to consist of being a cave and merely needed nesting supplies for the interior was the apprentice’s den. She padded towards the den in question with a small smile, the earth had been cleared out of it at last, and for the most part it resembled what it was before, just another ordinary den. She called out for her kit, wondering if she was inside and for her to leave the den. <strong>”Tigerpaw? Are you here? I need to talk to you.”</strong>

Finchbriars absence displayed to Tigerpaws notice had the apprentice at an episode of unease. Only to question which corner her tabby mentor would turn and see the russetted-white molly making a fool of herself, that was the only concern Tigerpaw had ingraved in her head — So lost in her own thoughts and success to the point of Finchbriars changing schedule of moods and shifty actions was almost no suprise to Tigerpaw.

Finchbriar was an unpredictable teacher, expectations shifting from a range of satisfaction of Tigerpaws good work — then immediately to rising the bar over the apprentices head in the matter of a few days, perhaps even hours depending how much Tigerpaw had been able to impress Finchbriar over the span of a week. 

Thin ears flattening against her skull as the thuds of a cats arrival was heard outside the apprentices den — It rumbled inside Tigerpaws head and immediately she shot herself up to her paws and turned towards the direction of the exit. An appearing shadow creeped against the inner walls of the shelter Tigerpaw was helping out to repair, though suprisingly it was much bigger than the usual smaller figure of Finchbriar — A cat she expected to come inside, seeing as Tigerpaw was the only cat inside the apprentices den with mud and moss awkwardly sticking to her paws and fur. 

A locked breath was now released to a cloudy huff once it had been the deputy to reveal her appearance rather than Finchbriar. Not just her deputy, but her mother as well.  

<strong>&quot;— Yes?&quot;</strong>  A sheepish smile spread across her muzzle, it had been a refreshing sight to say the least.

<strong>&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;</strong></span>

The deputy had her reservations about Finchbriar, knowing about the she-cat’s tendencies to be stuck-up and snobbish. Her superiority complex was practically tangible to anyone who even entered the presence of the prickly she-cat. Needless to say, Tigerpaw being assigned her as a mentor caused her concern, and now more than ever. Things could be dire, and she wanted to ensure her kits were going to be safe when this was all said and done. <em>Its not like she will remain her mentor after this, I know Icestar is not going to forgive a transgression like this, for any of them.</em> her ears flickered as she watched as her daughter’s frame physically relaxed at her sight, almost as if she was expecting someone else. <strong>”I just wanted to talk, to check in on you. How are you?”</strong> she peered down at her smaller kit with a small smile, she still dwarfed these adoptive kittens of hers, ever the behemoth she was. Laurelblaze wanted nothing more than to go back to the days where they were tiny and still able to all climb onto her back for an impromptu piggy-back ride… but alas, those days had long since passed, and they were entering a world that could be cruel and merciless to anyone.

<em>I would know better than most…</em>

<strong>”Have you had any issues with training? Is your mentor treating you properly?”</strong> upon realizing the implications of her question, the deputy wanted to chide herself for not even being subtle about her suspicions, the fact she wanted to round up every single one of the traitors to ThunderClan and exile them herself with their tails hanging between their legs was saying something. Laurelblaze was going to protect her family no matter what, Tigerpaw would not become a victim to one of Silentwing’s schemes. She would not lose more of her family to her. <strong>”If there’s any problems you’re encountering, you don’t have to hesitate to come to me, I can look into it and make sure everything is okay.”</strong> the concerned mother was coming out now, and the fact she had to keep sending her kit into the face of danger was torturous enough for her— but the fact she was keeping it secret from the rest of her clan, the rest of her family.

<em>I can’t risk their safety by telling them, not when there could be anyone listening in.</em>

It was only once she had begun to turn away that the sound of another approaching met her ears. From the depths of the medicine cat&#39;s den, there was a sound of hurried pawsteps and merely a moment or two afterwards, the tuxedo appeared, clearly seeming as if he&#39;d been in a rush to keep her from leaving. The warrior returned her attention to the young tom, who gazed at the prey with wide eyes, as if this had been the first time he&#39;d seen such a thing. With a roll of her eyes, the warrioress carefully placed her catch upon the ground, whiskers quivering. <strong>&quot;If such is what you&#39;d like to believe, then perhaps.&quot;</strong> She replied with a shrug. Hollowgrove was not the type to go out of her way for good deeds, but in this case, it made things more natural. She merely wanted to ask a few questions.
    <strong>&quot;I only came to ask you a question or two. If you have the time, that is. It seems as if I&#39;ve interrupted you.&quot;</strong> The molly stated plainly, tail swaying slowly behind her to indicate she wasn&#39;t exactly in a rush. Still, she continued onward after a moment or two. <strong>&quot;I believe I should start with the formal inquiry of your state of mind. Any improvement from our last meeting? I can&#39;t say much has changed, but perhaps in your eyes it has.&quot;</strong> She was certain that such would be said. So many of Thunderclan seemed to believe in high hopes and unrealistic dreams, for the mere idea of soothing whatever inner turmoil they faced or otherwise, refused to encounter.</span>

Yet she didn&#39;t move her position otherwise, instead, merely allowing herself to gaze elsewhere as she awaited a reply. How she despised such characters, but the clan seemed overrun with them. Even her own offspring had fallen to such a thing, which was a horrendous thought. She believed this to be a sign of weakness, falling victim to such a nature so quickly. The immature and inexperienced did not win battles, they were destroyed by the opposing force. And such was what had happened to Thunderclan themselves, only a short while ago.

<em><strong><em>- Past -</em></strong></em>

It was clear to see that Wrenpaw hadn&#39;t exactly expected the answer.  Shock was displayed all over her features and body language, and her surprise seemed a bit odd now that Marigolddust no longer felt quite as startled by the idea.  He had known for a day or two about how he was to become the medicine cat, since he had chosen to agree to it, and therefore the shock had... well, it wasn&#39;t as strong now as it had been when he was first called to Icestar&#39;s den and asked the question that had changed his life.  And now it would all be official, once he and Icestar went to the moonpool the next day after the planned ceremonies.  But, before his place in the clan was set in stone, or more of, set in the stars, he wanted to make sure that the second-most cat that it would affect the most in his life knew about it.  Otherwise, he might be asked or requested to refuse before it was all too permanent, and he didn&#39;t want to do so without permission, even if the request for such wasn&#39;t all too clear.  If he asked Wrenpaw upright whether she would be okay with him becoming the new Medicine cat, then he would have yet another cat he would need to think about when the last chance to change his decision came.  Hopefully, with his acceptance of keeping her as his apprentice and taking the new rank would ease both sides.</span>

                 <em><strong><em>&quot;I really hope so,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said with a nervous chuckle, giving Wrenpaw a grateful smile as she spoke the reassuring words.  For once, he let the uncertainty behind his words roam free.  She didn&#39;t seem all too outraged about the whole idea, and her smile actually convinced him otherwise.  Hopefully it was a true one, and her words didn&#39;t hold some secret meaning he was failing to grasp.  By now he knew how quick of a learner Wrenpaw was, and for all he knew, she might have learned how to put on a fake smile from some cat around camp.  Hopefully said cat wasn&#39;t him, as his fake smiles were almost always transparent when it came to strong feelings such as sorrow or guilt.  Marigolddust had experience at telling whether expressions were masks or real smiles since Fernpaw, more often than not, put on a smile to all of her patients, even when she was feeling the lowest of lows.  Starclan, he missed Fernpaw.  <em>Please let her be safe, and help her to learn how to express a real smile...</em> he prayed quietly to himself, before quickly pushing the thought out of his head as Wrenpaw continued.</span>

               A soft look of understanding crossed Marigolddust&#39;s storm-toned features as she finished, and once she had, he raised a paw and playfully cuffed her ear.  Perhaps the gesture was meant to make her relax more, or maybe it was to keep himself from showing Wrenpaw that he was just as unsure as to whether he could handle the stress.  Being a mentor was enough work, but of course, when he was asked whether he would take his friend&#39;s place, he had requested to keep Wrenpaw as an apprentice.  Of course he had- he wouldn&#39;t be able to live with himself otherwise.  But, as he had more time to think about it, he tried to come up with how exactly he would be able to deal with it all.  He was putting more weight on his shoulders than his thin limbs might be able to handle, and he had yet to figure out if they could.  Hopefully he wouldn&#39;t have to wait long, and hopefully the result of this all was a positive one, rather than negative.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;ll be just fine.  It shouldn&#39;t be too much work- you already know more than I expected you to, and you learn faster, too.  Plus, it&#39;s just a buncha&#39; plants.  How hard could it be?&quot;</em></strong></em> he joked light-heartedly, hoping the words would have a positive impact on Wrenpaw&#39;s mood.

<em><strong><em>- Future -</em></strong></em>

Fortunately, Marigolddust had heard Lionstep&#39;s weak call, although he had heard the elder hit the ground first.  Stiffening, it took Marigolddust a moment to realize what might have happened outside of his den.  He had felt something similar when Featherpelt had fallen and passed, although Marigolddust had hardly been present when it had happened.  Panic struck Marigolddust&#39;s chest as he remembered the poor fate of Laurelblaze&#39;s father, and he rushed to set down the herbs and run out of the den out of fear that such was occurring again.  Fortunately, when he exited his den, his eyes didn&#39;t land on a dead cat; instead, they landed on a fairly alive elder, although he was still clearly struggling.  Concern flashed through his lemon-toned optics as Marigolddust hurried over to his older clan-mate.  What was wrong with him?  Marigolddust didn&#39;t recognize the feline, but he had also just gotten into the position not long ago... maybe it was the sickness that had been spreading through camp that caused this?  If that was the case, then this was a new symptom that he hadn&#39;t seen before.</span>

              Turning around, Marigolddust rushed back into his den and tried to decide what he needed in order to help the struggling tom in the camp.  <em>Think, think, think!  What did Beanspark teach you?  Fernpaw?</em> he thought to himself, unable to keep his nerves from making his panic increase the longer he had to wait and think.  He had no idea what was wrong with the elder, and he didn&#39;t even know if he could stop what was happening.  Was he dying?  Was it already too late?  No, he had to hurry, or else that would be the case.  He tried to search through his memories, gathering all that he remembered from lessons that he had had with Fernpaw and Beanspark.  Fernpaw had only taught him about outside injuries, and that didn&#39;t seem like the case here.  This new patient of his was having a different type of problem, something that seemed to give him trouble breathing; he could tell from the strained breaths and the inability to speak.  What herb helped with the inability to breath, or chest problems in general?  <em>Come on, what did Beanspark teach you?  You need to remember these things!</em> he scolded to himself.  

               He remembered that Beanspark had taught him something of the sort, just incase new symptoms popped up from the illness that the clan was being plagued with.  But what was it?  The answer came to his mind as soon as his eyes landed on the herbs.  They were all three fairly common, although the two had had to cross into the twoleg territory in order to get one of them.  Bending his neck, he snatched up the catmint, thyme, and coltsfoot, along with some wet mossballs.  Once he had all that he hoped he needed, he swiftly brought them all out to the stranger tom.</span>

                <em><strong><em>&quot;Here, eat these- they should help you to be able to breath, and maybe they&#39;ll help you to be able to tell me what&#39;s going on,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, pushing the herbs towards the elder.  he wasn&#39;t sure if the other tom could manage to eat the herbs during his chest pain, but he wanted to see just how bad this was, even if it made him feel guilty in the process.  He was panicking, and the only way to stop that was from figuring out what was happening.  And so, he would try.

<em><strong><em>- Future -</em></strong></em>

The young medicine cat visibly relaxed as Lionstep&#39;s breathing became more natural with the herbs.  So he <em>had</em> chosen the right herbs for the situation... Maybe he really was learning and memorizing these things, instead of just forgetting them like he often did names.  This relief morphed into bewilderment, though, as Lionstep began to apologize.  With a small furrow of his non-existent brows, Marigolddust was quick to object.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Of course, but it wasn&#39;t your fault at all.  Things like this just happen sometimes,&quot;</em></strong></em> he reassured, hoping that Lionstep believed his words as much as Marigolddust did himself.  He was confused as to how such an occurrence could be blamed on the person having the spasm.  In his eyes, it was like blaming a cat for having a sore throat or some similar problem.  How could Lionstep imagine that it was his own fault that he had had the chest pain and trouble breathing?  He hadn&#39;t expected the get the answer that he received not long after he had spoken.</span>

                The herbs that he was supposed to take?  What did the elder mean by that?  <em><strong><em>&quot;You were supposed to be taking herbs-?  Were you having problems when Fern- when *I</em> wasn&#39;t the medicine cat..?&quot;*</strong></em> he asked, stopping himself from finishing his friend&#39;s name, just incase it triggered some buried grief.  He didn&#39;t want to be seen crying when he was in the middle of taking care of a patient, even if just the thought of his friend made his eyes water.  Marigolddust didn&#39;t recognize this cat, but then again, he was often off doing warrior duties or training Wrenpaw when Fernpaw was still around, caring for her patients.  Lionstep could have easily just been patient that he had never actually run into.  He didn&#39;t recall hearing about problems from a fire, although he could guess what fire had caused the spasms that Lionstep had been having.  Laurelblaze had told him plenty about it, and how they had had to rebuilt the camp after the forest fire had burnt almost everything.  In a sense, it was similar to what the clan was facing now, except it was mud and water they were fighting against, not raging flames of red and yellow.  <em><strong><em>&quot;How bad was this fire?&quot;</em></strong></em> Marigolddust asked, both out of curiosity and because it might help him understand the elder&#39;s situation.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Have you been having many problems with it recently?&quot;</em></strong></em></span>

                 <em>I thought a few times of skipping it wouldn&#39;t hurt me.</em>  So Lionstep was told to take herbs like these, but had decided not to for the sake of the clan.  It was selfless, in a way, but it also meant that Lionstep wasn&#39;t taking the treatment for whatever problems he was facing.  He knew that Beanspark wouldn&#39;t have let him continue this way, and so Marigolddust would try and do the same.  <em><strong><em>&quot;It&#39;s really nice of you to be thinking of the others in the clan.  I understand what it&#39;s like to put them before yourself.  But you *really</em> need to take care of yourself, too, or the kits in the nursery might loose a cat that they look up to.  We don&#39;t want that, do we?&quot;*</strong></em> he asked, before continuing with his tone softening even more.  <em><strong><em>&quot;We also haven&#39;t been needing these specific herbs all that much.. they&#39;re just as backup.  I can always gather more if need be,&quot;</em></strong></em> he offered.

<em><strong><em>- Close Past -</em></strong></em>

<em><strong><em>&quot;That&#39;s true, I can show you when we&#39;re out searching for them,&quot;</em></strong></em> he suggested, a smile crossing his features at her enthusiasm.  He hadn&#39;t expected her to seem so.. excited about this?  He wasn&#39;t sure if she was actually feeling the emotion, but she definitely seemed optimistic.  Her goal was accomplished as his smile widened a little bit, more genuine than the ones before, at her fairly wise statement and pride over it.  It wasn&#39;t often that he met or interacted with a cat who was so positive, especially when it came to learning.  Nectarglade even had a saying for it.  He almost chuckled at Nectarglade&#39;s rather hyper reaction, but instead he nodded.  <em><strong><em>&quot;It *is</em> definitely good to widen your knowledge,&quot;*</strong></em> he agreed.  His previous fear that Nectarglade wouldn&#39;t want to join him or that he would have ruined her day by guilt tripping her into this dispersed as he witnessed her rather half-glass-full nature.  

               Turning, Marigolddust padded after Nectarglade, quickening his pace until he was properly caught up with her.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, any herb would likely work,&quot;</em></strong></em> he started, <em><strong><em>&quot;Although, marigold, cobwebs, poppyseed, some moss, willow leaves, juniper berries, thyme, and mallow leaves are probably the most needed right now.&quot;</em></strong></em>  Marigolddust zoned out a little as he spoke, listing through all of the herbs that Beanspark and Fernpaw had taught him.  The first ones were for basic injury such as cuts, and the last ones were herbs that Beanspark had suggested after Marigolddust had mentioned the odd sickness that had spread throughout camp.  As the two cats slipped through the entrance of the camp and into the Thunderclan territory, he tried to recall where all of the herbs could be found.</span>

                <em><strong><em>&quot;Cobwebs would probably be found almost anywhere, although with the landslide the ones at higher elevations were probably the only ones to survive.

We might want to start at the meadow, though- We&#39;ll probably have more luck there than anywhere else,&quot;</em></strong></em> he suggested.  Of course he wanted to try and search around the bodies of water in their territory for the herbs more specific for the illness in Thunderclan, but he wasn&#39;t sure they would be able to find any.  Despite his desire to find more of the herbs that Beanspark explained, Marigolddust would have rather returned to come with something rather than risk coming back empty-pawed.

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Hollowgrove&#39;s response to his question wasn&#39;t the most direct as to what the real answer was, sending Marigolddust mixed signals.  He opened and closed his mouth, unsure what to say.  <em><strong><em>&quot;U-um, alright,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, reluctant to gather the prey.  Had he taken the prey she had planned to keep for her own meal?  How could he let himself be so rude as to assume another cat&#39;s prey was meant for him, just because they approached his den with it?  For all he knew, it could have been for a patient inside of his den that Hollowgrove knew well enough to want to feed.  Biting his lip, he stepped back, keeping away from the prey for the moment.  If anything, Hollowgrove&#39;s eye roll was enough to hint that the prey was, indeed, meant for a cat other than him.  Or perhaps he had simply just done something to offend the warrioress.  

                 <em>A question or two?</em>  The statement caught him off-guard, bringing him back to attention.  What questions would Hollowgrove have for him?  Were they simple questions, like how he was doing with herb collecting?  Maybe Hollowgrove really was just checking in on him.. although, for some reason, he found himself a bit uncertain as he responded.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I mean, um- sure, of course.  You&#39;re not interrupting too much, don&#39;t worry.  What would you like?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked, settling down into a sitting position to show her that he didn&#39;t plan on running back into the den to continue whatever he had been doing.  He would get to it later.  His clanmates came before himself, anyways... that was the way of a medicine cat, wasn&#39;t it?  Curling his rail around his paws, he patiently waited for the questions.</span>

                It didn&#39;t take long, and by the time he was asked, he had plenty of time to think it over.  He felt a bit anxious, for some odd reason.  He couldn&#39;t stop thinking back to the traitors that lauelblaze and Icestar had mentioned to him... but maybe Hollowgrove was just a curious clanmate.  He couldn&#39;t quite recall if her name was among those that the leader and deputy had named, but so far, her questions proved to be an innocent inquartation.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;m doing pretty alright, actually.  Learning and training at the same time is... time consuming, but Beanspark is teaching me plenty, so I&#39;m not so inexperienced that I have to be so worried as before.&quot;</em></strong></em> he explained, offering her a small smile after the response.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Thank you for asking.  I hope you&#39;re doing well, too.&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, returning the formal greeting with a dip of his head.  He paused for a moment as Hollowgrove nudged the prey closer to him.  It would be even less polite to refuse the prey now.  Gingerly, he reached a paw forwards and brought the prey to him, carefully using a unsheathed claw to quickly examine the prey for any hint of sickness.  He had to get in the habit of doing so, in case the prey was the origin of Thunderclan&#39;s illness.

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Marigolddust listened quietly, taking note of the little problems that Lionstep claimed to have.  <em><strong>&quot;Well, it sounds like these are all the herbs you&#39;ll really need, then,&quot;*</strong></em> he reasurred, butting on a small smile before he realized he was missing something.  Wasn&#39;t there something else that he was supposed to do, something he was supposed to suggest?  Some sort of treatment that would help sore muscles and stiffened muscles, such as those in Lionstep&#39;s older body and those around the lungs.  Beanspark had mentioned it faintly, but it took Marigolddust a moment to remember.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh!  And if you ever feel like it&#39;s going to happen and you&#39;re farther away from me than you were today, I suggest bathing in some water.  It helps your muscles to relax, although I can&#39;t promise you that it won&#39;t make your fur dirty.&quot;</em></strong></em> he suggested, gathering up all but a few herbs that he had brought out with him.  Lionstep seemed alright now, but he had to make sure that the elder had some extras on him, just incase.</span>

             <em><strong><em>&quot;When it&#39;s cold?&quot;</em></strong></em> Marigolddust repeated, concern flashing in his eyes.  Who Lilyheart was, he wasn&#39;t sure, but he assumed that they were a loved one that had passed... or at least, that was the most likely situation where breaking the clan-code wasn&#39;t involved.  Marigolddust didn&#39;t want Lionstep to feel like he had to stay away from whoever Lilyheart was, but he had to gently suggest it, for the sake of the elder&#39;s health.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, maybe you should stay away from the idea of leaving camp when leaf-bare comes around... at least without your herbs and a companion with you.  The same goes with gathering herbs.  It *is</em> really nice of you to offer to help, and I would love your help, but make sure you have someone with you when yo do go out to do so, okay?&quot;*</strong></em> he said, before amusement bloomed in his chest at the sound of Lionstep&#39;s excitement over sharing a story to the kits of the clan.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll love it.&quot;</em></strong></em> he agreed.  

             At the sound that these fits were usually only a few minutes long, Marigolddust felt more relaxed with the idea of leaving the elder alone in camp with the herbs.  If he was capable of eating the herbs while having a spasm, then he should be fine, for the most part, at least.  If anything else happened to him in the process, Marigolddust could help him more.  <em><strong><em>&quot;If that&#39;s the case, then please try and keep on top of taking the herbs,&quot;</em></strong></em> he requested, his voice nothing but friendly, all hints of strict seriousness free from his voice, although he felt it in his chest nonetheless.

<em><strong><em>- Future -</em></strong></em>

Nobody wanted to go with Lionstep?  That seemed a bit unlikely, but at the same time, Marigolddust had been a warrior before.  He knew what it was like to be busy and unable to do things such as occupy an elder to their loved one&#39;s sleeping place.  So, perhaps, it wasn&#39;t quite as surprising than it may have seemed.  Maybe Lionstep just hadn&#39;t been looking in the right places, or the cats in the clan truly didn&#39;t have the time or interest to ocompany him.  <em>It&#39;s rude to assume someone else is wrong,</em> he reminded himself, and guilt was quick to spring up through his emotions.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, whenever you can&#39;t find anybody else, I could always join you to make sure you&#39;re alright.&quot;</em></strong></em> He offered, a friendly smile displaying across his face, although his shame in his assumptions lay secret behind his eyes.  

             Finally, Lionstep stood up as quickly as he might have originally fallen down.  So it really wasn&#39;t anything too serious or too worrisome, just a recurring problem.  With one last, soft smile, Marigolddust nodded to him and paved a paw as a farewell.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Take care of yourself,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, before the elder disappeared into the elders&#39; den.  Releasing a sigh of relief himself, he stood and turned around, returning to his den and the unfamiliar duties that waited for him inside of it.

<strong>” All cats who are old enough to catch their own prey, gather around for a Clan meeting!”</strong> Icestar’s unexpected call rang through the developing campgrounds. Much progress has been made since the landslide and while some aspects of their lovely stone hollow was still in shambles, much of it was now well-repaired and improved thanks to Laurelblaze’s determination to make the camp fit for all sizes. 

Her fiery optics scanned the gathering felines below, watching as they all streamed in like fish and collected themselves in the clearing. It was a tight-knit group, perfect for the chilly, but sunny afternoon. Snow was on the horizon, Icestar could feel it from the Highledge as an icy wind tugged at her thick coat. According to her calculations, the camp should be repaired by then. If unexpected delays chose not to make an appearance.

The deputy of ThunderClan had heeded the call to gather the clan together for a ceremony, quickly departing the warriors den and entering the clearing. The burly tortoiseshell padded towards her apprentice, Tigerpaw, who’d been sitting in the clearing already, having beaten her to the space. <strong>”Hey Tigerpaw.”</strong> she greeted the younger she-cat with a small, warm smile. She was about warrior age already, and the deputy had an inkling of what this ceremony was for, though she wasn’t exactly sure, it wasn’t as if she was involved in these matters. That was strictly Icestar’s duty by conducting these meetings and ceremonies, not hers. <strong>”It’s getting chilly out, thank StarClan my coat is thick.”</strong> she murmured quietly, staring up at the lynx-point perched upon the Highledge, awaiting whatever came next. She’d be watching with keen interest, especially if it was concerning one of her own apprentices.

<em>She’ll have made it to warriorhood.</em>

<strong>” There is only good news to be shared in this meeting,”</strong> she began once the remnants of her Clanmates made an appearance. <strong>” The coming of leaf-bare has always brought on newly-made warriors in preparation for a harder season. Having trained hard for moons, earning their warrior name and title as an official warrior of ThunderClan is an honour that I hope they value throughout their lives.”</strong>

Icestar’s gaze focused upon Tigerpaw. <strong>” I, Icestar of ThunderClan, call upon my warrior ancestors to look down on this apprentice. They have trained hard to understand the ways of your noble code, and I commend them to you as a warrior in their turn.”</strong> It seemed as if the chattering of squirrels and singing of birds even hushed into a silence as the lynx-pointed leader spoke. <strong>” Tigerpaw, do you promise to uphold the warrior code and to protect and defend your Clan, even at the cost of your life?”</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>”Hey,”</strong> Tigerpaw’s hushed greeting was paired with a small smile. She felt the tension between her and Laurelblaze was finally at its end, and it felt good to have their relationship back. She also felt relieved by Icestar’s introduction to the ceremony. They could all use some good news right now.

<em>A new warrior? Who could it be?</em> Tigerpaw looked around, searching for a candidate. It wasn’t until a couple moments later that she realized everyone was looking at <em>her</em>, including Icestar, when she checked. That’s when it struck her. <em>Wait, me?!</em>

Instantly her heart spiked, and she stood as summoned, but couldn’t stop the protest that bursted from her maw. <strong>”But I haven’t even had my assessment yet!-“</strong> She cut herself off just as the words tumbled out, stealing a look in Laurelblaze’s direction. The look on her mentor’s face confirmed that Icestar was making no mistake.

Embarrassed and humbled at the same time, the young tabby she-cat walked forward and dipped her head. <strong>”I do.”</strong></span>

The outburst sent her dark ears pricking but her intent remained unchanged: Tigerpaw was going to be made a warrior. 

Thankfully, the senior apprentice responded with the traditional words of confirmation - a solid agreement to her rising in ThunderClan’s abundant ranks. It was the determination and honestly lacing amidst each word that caused a proud smile to break across her white maw. 

 <strong>” Then by the powers of StarClan,”</strong> Icestar continued in her confident tone. <strong>” I give you your warrior name. Tigerpaw, from this moment on, you will be known as Tigerspring. StarClan honours your spirit and devotion, and we welcome you as a full warrior of ThunderClan.”</strong> Stepping forward to face the tabby head-on, she then leaned forward and pressed her dark, leathery nose against the smooth slope of Tigerspring’s forehead.

Icestar’s touch sent a chill down her spine, and she held her head high while the clan chorused her new name. Until now she wasn’t sure if she deserved to be accepted back, or if they trusted her, but the ceremony vanquished all of that.

Tigerspring looked back at her now former mentor, tears pricking her raspberry eyes. <em>Thank you.</em> Without Laurelblaze’s patience, forgiveness, and belief in her, she never would’ve made it here.</span>

Her guess as to what the matter of the ceremony was correct, for her apprentice was being promoted at last. A surge of pride swelled in her chest for a moment as she beamed up at her now former apprentice, the newest addition to their roster of warriors. The deputy took a deep breath before she began to lead the chant of her apprentice’s new name, shouting it at the top of her lungs so that everyone may hear. <strong>”Tigerspring! Tigerspring! Tigerspring!”</strong> she called out the new warrior’s name with utter joy, proud that she made it this far, that she had finally achieved this important milestone in any warrior’s life. She couldn’t feel more excited in this moment, for the future was bright for her former pupil. Laurelblaze couldn’t wait to see how things turned out for her.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Juniperpaw had been trying to figure out how to approach Tigerspring since the day before at her warrior ceremony. Part of him didn’t even want to, but neither of them had spoken to one another in so long he felt like he had to be the one to talk first. He couldn’t handle the awkwardness between the two of them any longer. Maybe if he talked to her they could just put the past behind them and stop avoiding each other so much. Although, it wouldn’t be hard to avoid her now that they weren’t sharing a den. With a heavy sigh the silver and black tabby trotted over to Tigerspring. 

His expression betrayed none of his emotions as he stood before her, giving a small dip of his head. It felt weird, knowing that she was a warrior and he was still just an apprentice, but he knew that his ceremony was coming soon. <strong>”Hey. I just wanted to congratulate you on becoming a warrior. Tigerspring is a really great name.”</strong> He said, forcing a little smile. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

<strong>”So, look, I know things have been pretty awkward lately and I wanted to say I’m sorry. I uh… don’t have any hard feelings, and I hope you don’t either.”</strong> He said.

Even if she didn’t have the eloquence to say all this, the look she gave him from her round pink eyes sure did. <strong>”No hard feelings at all,”</strong> she mewed softly, a small but genuine upturn tugging at her muzzle.

Before she knew it she had her skull cradled on his shoulder. It lasted only briefly, and probably sent nerves stirring in both their bellies. Then Tigerspring stepped away and gave a big groaning stretch.

<strong>”StarClan, that was tough! I need to stretch my legs.”</strong> She didn’t head for the territory immediately though, letting a silent invitation which she didn’t have the guts to voice hang in the air. <span class="mention" title="tremb#3692">@tremb</span></span>

Still, he let a rather wide smile creep onto his lips for a few moments. He felt much better in this moment than he had since their split, if he was being honest. 

He laughed softly, nodding his head even though he didn’t understand yet how tough a silent vigil could be. <strong>”Yeah, I can’t say I’m looking forward to that part,”</strong> he mused. He felt as if she was hinting at an invite to go on a walk, but he wasn’t quite sure. <strong>”A walk in the territory sounds nice,”</strong> he said tentatively, not sure if his words were a question or a statement. <span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span></span>

Hollowgrove&#39;s violet gaze narrowed slightly as the tom spoke, his constant hesitance ticking her off with each passing moment. He reminded her of her offspring - seemingly so naive, the cruel world would tear them apart without a second thought. It infuriated her that such weaklings existed - especially among the leaders of the clan. They should be strong and mighty - not those who lived on hope and faith in imaginary cats that roamed around in the sky at night. An amusing thought, yet painful at the same time. She lived among a clan of idiots. It explained their situation all too well. They&#39;d best be grateful they hadn&#39;t fallen during the mudslide.
    Marigolddust&#39;s words were hardly heard as the molly stood there, lost in thought. Finchbriar was right. Thunderclan needed new leadership, and quite frankly, with a soul such as her they&#39;d be much better off. She was unaware that their own presence among the clan had been discovered, but the growing tension and uncertainty from a few particular souls was enough for the braided feline to grow suspicious. She believed her to be an intimidating soul by nature, but something concerning how her clanmates were acting was upsetting her mind. <em>Paranoia. No such thing rests among you.</em> She thought to herself and with that, tossed the thought aside.</span>

Regardless, the tabby shook her head, a sigh emitting from her. <strong>&quot;It&#39;d be up to you to heal the clan. Thunderclan is still very much in shambles, one way or another.

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Marigolddust examined Hollowgrove&#39;s expression watchfully as he spoke, noticing all of the little indications and gestures she made as she listened to him.  The young medic felt his insecurities rise with each passing moment.  The twitch of an ear, the flicker of a tail, the narrowing of her eyes... Everything she did seemed to be a sign of disapproval and dislike.  He knew he shouldn&#39;t be seeking approval from cats he hardly knew; Icestar and Laurelblaze&#39;s confidence in him should be enough.  But, then again, being the medicine cat wasn&#39;t going to be easy if he was disliked by everyone in the clan besides the two other high ranks.  The was just a mere example of what might be shown to him in the future, what might be the reaction to this new position of his.  Fidgeting his paws ever so slightly to try and get rid of a bit of this growing anxiety, Marigolddust turned his gaze off of the warrior&#39;s face.  If Starclan truly had been false, perhaps Marigolddust would have better understood how Hollowgrove felt, even if it wouldn&#39;t do so much.  But Marigolddust knew that the cats rumored to be living in the stars weren&#39;t any fairy tale.  He had met one in person- a previous medicine cat at that- and had felt the magic of their touch when he was appointed the medicine cat of Thunderclan.  Unfortunately, Hollowgrove hadn&#39;t lived through such an event, and she didn&#39;t have enough faith to believe in what she couldn&#39;t see.  She might have seen it as strength, but in truth, it was just as likely to bring her downfall as it was to bring Thunderclan&#39;s.</span>

              Finally, the sharp hums of Hollowgrove&#39;s voice rung out once more, addressing him once again, rather than her own thoughts.  Turning his gaze back to Hollowgrove&#39;s cold gaze, Marigolddust paused his figuring as he waited to see what she was going to say.  Of course he hoped to hear that her day had been going well, but he wasn&#39;t sure whether he expected such an answer to come from her or not.  She didn&#39;t look all that happy, anyways. What Marigolddust didn&#39;t expect was to hear words he had heard only in his mind being spoken outloud, although not from his own mouth.  Involuntarily, the young tuxedo stiffened.  He was unable to come up with a way to respond to everything that was happening, so he could only freeze and hope that he was hearing her wrong.  Of course, he was wrong.</span>

                Of course Beanspark would be leaving, maybe even sometime soon.  He had his own clan to take care of, and he couldn&#39;t spend his time solely on Marigolddust, no matter how much the Thunderclanner selfishly wish he could.  Quite honestly, he was terrified.  Leaf-bare was coming and he didn&#39;t have a plan.  Only Beanspark did, and he wouldn&#39;t be there forever.  What would he do if he ended up stuck with a patient he couldn&#39;t help?  How many cats might die just because he was inexperienced ormunsuremod himself?  A frown tugged at the corners of his mouth as the thoughts ran wild, stampeding over all of the confidence that he had gathering, whether fake or honest confidence, it was hard to tell.  <em>I hope so</em>. That was his core reaction; an agreement to Hollowgrove&#39;s uncertainty in his abilities.  He almost said it out loud, laying cement over the opinion and paving it as fact.  He managed to, fortunately, stop himself.  He couldn&#39;t say such things, especially around his clanmates.  It would just make them aware of how unsure he was in himself, making it so that they could think of him as nothing more than the cat who tried and couldn&#39;t.  Though, perhaps that was already too late in this particular case.</span>

               Using all of his willpower to try and push down his fear, Marigolddust attempted to speak smoothly, although, in the end, he was unsuccessful.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I-It&#39;s fine, really, I&#39;m ready- i-it&#39;s fine..&quot;</em></strong></em> he stammered, half to himself.  He bit his tounge hard as his weak tone reached his own ears.  He had stammered, he had repeated himself... Surely he couldn&#39;t be this scared.  But he was, and now that he had let some of it slip, all he could do was glance around, searching for any cat who might have overheard.  Maybe he could convince them, tell them that he was just tired and couldn&#39;t figure out his own words.  He found himself double guessing himself, just because of something a clanmate said.  Why, he wondered, was a single cat&#39;s voice so impactive to him?  No, he had to try and ignore what Hollowgrove was stirring up.  He had to put on a strong demeanor, for the clan and himself both.  He could ruin this all by showing one of the traitors that were hiding somewhere in camp that he was so fragile, even more so than they must have originally believed.  But either way, he and the traitors both had one thought in common; they both knew that Thunderclan deserved better than this.

The black spotted she cat sat up glancing around the camp even though she has stayed away from her kittypet family. Her siblings had the gaul to find the clans and tell her their parent had recently passed and left. She wasn&#39;t close to them in the slightest but hearing of their passing still effected her. But with has happened in the clan she has been trying to get back to the present and focus the thoughts that came to her mind cause her to pin her ears and tail to lash.

The deputy couldn&#39;t help but to feel as if she were walking on eggshells around her clanmates. Things were getting tense, the disappearance of all three of their spies had put the entire clan on high alert, but more so the higher-ranked cats as they had been the only ones who knew about the spies <em>being spies</em>. Her clanmates were worried, <em>she</em> was worried. Three young cats go missing after multiple empty shells of rogue corpses were found on their borders, and a landslide they were starting to finally recover from?

<em>This was just phenomenal.</em>

Laurelblaze let out a small, frustrated sigh as she stepped out into the clearing from the warriors den, spotting one of her clanmates from afar. <em>Sapphireheart</em>, she could have sworn she&#39;d spoken to the other warrioress in the past, but she couldn&#39;t be so sure. She knew all of her clanmates by name, but to say she was close to each and every single one of them was a stretch. Sometimes she only spoke to some about duties, though she wasn&#39;t exactly proud of that. Laurelblaze just didn&#39;t want to appear standoffish to her clanmates, she wanted to be approachable. Most of the time though, she had to initiate the conversation, just like today.

<strong>&quot;Hey, Sapphireheart. Are you faring well today?&quot;</strong>

Even if their camp was a wreck and their food supplies were running thin with the season, she was always gonna check in on her clanmates and how their moods were. Couldn&#39;t hurt even if everything around them seemed to be a mess.

Noticing the other cat she tried to calm down and quiet the thoughts in her head but her tail couldnt stay still. 

&quot;I&#39;m fine just too many thoughts going on at once&quot; she sighed &quot;how are you I know with everything going on you must be stressed out&quot; she asked with slight worryness in her voice.

Even though she doesnt talk to many clanmates do to their thoughts on when she had first joined the clan. But still no one can deny her the worry she has when other cats are in danger.

The russet-toned tortoiseshell blinked for a moment, another sigh escaping her lips. <strong>”Three apprentices go missing, after everything that has happened to us. I can only wonder when we are truly going to catch a break.”</strong> Laurelblaze’s ears folded back against her head as she gazed up at the pallid leaf-fall sky. She wanted to unload all of the secrets she’d been holding back from her clanmates. That there were traitors among their ranks, that they were going to war against their leaders in the Dark Forest and hadn’t told them. All because they needed to focus on recovering from the landslide, on regaining their strength as they prepared for battle. Yet it appeared the time for battle was rapidly approaching, almost imminent. <em>We need to find our clanmates first, then we’ll rip those traitors apart. Silentwing will not get away with turning my clanmates against me.</em>

<strong>”I’m praying for their safety, that they will come home to us alive.”</strong>

Truly, she could not read the minds of her clanmates and gauge what they were actually feeling deep down. While she liked to think she could be a shoulder they could use in trying times, she knew not every single one of them would open up to her, and that was okay. <strong>&quot;You think? I was worried some were under the belief that we&#39;re never going to finish rebuilding, at least not until leaf-bare is over. At least now the dens have room to sleep in them, we just need to fix them up a bit and reinforce them for snowfall.&quot;</strong> her head was always focused on work, trying to distract herself from the grim reality of their situation, that they were truly not as safe as they seemed. Laurelblaze wanted to make sure her clan would remain secure in the coming months, and she was determined to snuff out any threat that may come to them. No one was to mess with her clan, not <em>ever.</em>

The time had come that they increase their efforts in trying to locate their lost apprentices. The traitors around camp had noticeably been less present around camp and she had a sinking feeling as to why. <em>They must know, why would all three of our spies go missing at once? We must rescue them.</em> she shook her head as she cleared her throat, preparing to call together the cats she&#39;d task with this important duty. It was time they finally strike back.

<strong>&quot;Cardinalspark, Jayfang, Tigerspring, Coyotepaw! I need all of you to start searching the territory together as a group for Wrenpaw, Cloverpaw, and Bramblepaw!&quot;</strong> she called out to her selected group of cats, for they were trustworthy members of the clan who she believed could help save the trio of spies. <em>We haven&#39;t forgotten, those snakehearts will have hell to pay for this!</em> the deputy&#39;s resolve was burning, for she was determined to bring justice for their crimes against ThunderClan.

<em>No one harms my clanmates.</em>

The young tabby tom felt almost powerless when it was discovered his best friend had gone missing, he had hardly eaten, slept, and couldn&#39;t focus on training at all. Wrenpaw was out there, probably scared and not knowing where she was- and he didn&#39;t even know why! Three of his peers go missing after bodies show up around the territory before the landslide? What else was he supposed to think, for he, like the rest of his clanmates, did not know the true scope of the situation, that his friend had been acting as a spy on behalf of her clan in order to thwart the Dark Forest&#39;s schemes. All he knew was that she was missing, and he wanted to help her. So when this patrol was gathered together, Coyotepaw sprang to his paws and nearly sprinted to the clearing, a determined expression on his features as he stood to wait for the others.

<em>I&#39;ve got to help my friend!</em></span>

Hard as it was to keep track of every cat in the busy aftermath of the landslide, nobody could deny the obvious absence of those apprentices. The warrior stood and came to her former mentor without a heartbeat&#39;s delay.

Should she be pleased that she was chosen for this important mission? Worried about the safety of her old denmates? Anxiety and seriousness wasn&#39;t like her. Instead, she felt a sense of protectiveness over the missing cats, and sureness that by the time the sun set today, they&#39;d bring them safely home. She touched her tail tip encouragingly to Coyotepaw&#39;s shoulder and flashed him a soft smile. Even in dire moments, her certainty was infectious. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span> <span class="mention" title="-Swift-#3184">@-Jayfang-</span> <span class="mention" title="tremb#3692">@tremb</span> <span class="mention" title="Alexander Phantomhive#5197">@Shadow</span> <span class="mention" title="northern foxy#8613">@spark&#39;s clone™</span></span>

Things had been...particularly rough as of late. The clan seemed to be practically falling apart still. First bodies of dead cats, then the mudslide and now...missing apprentices. Had Starclan placed a curse upon them? Something just wasn&#39;t right here and either they had upset their ancestors in some manner or these were signs of something even more horrifying about to be unleashed upon them. The russet figure&#39;s fur bristled, his amber gaze harboring that of rare concern. His whiskers quivered as he stared towards the camp&#39;s entrance, half expecting someone to come charging through it with news of the missing apprentices. Surely...surely, nothing terrible could&#39;ve happened...right?
    His thoughts were shattered by the sudden cry of Laurelblaze. <em>That&#39;s it.</em> The time had come. Sooner or later, one knew they&#39;d eventually seek out their missing clanmates and now, the deputy&#39;s voice harbored that of urgency. Whatever had happened to the apprentices would be discovered sooner or later, hopefully the former over the latter. Nothing good would await whatever they found, predator or foe. Every Thunderclanner knew this, when times reached this point.
    Now, as his name was called, Cardinalspark arose. Whipping around toward the large feline, the russet warrior hurried over, his gaze focused. Tail lashing about, the warrior merely nodded at the orders given, a sense of determination overwhelming him. <em>We&#39;ll find them. We have to.</em>

Now wasn’t the time to spend sitting around in camp, Coyotepaw was unusually impatient, and as soon as he saw some of his other patrol members, the young tom was quick to make a bee-line for the camp exit. <strong>”My best friend is out there! We need to go now!”</strong> he growled lightly, not even bothering to stop for the other warriors, they needed to go and find them all right away! <em>I can’t let my clan down, I gotta help!</em>

The lanky tom sprinted through the tunnel, clawing his way through as he was quick to depart for the forest. They needed to find their clanmates, and quick! <strong>”Come on! We need to find them all!”</strong>

The pallid gray skies over ThunderClan were typical of this time of year, but were still nonetheless was foreboding. The trees were slowly being stripped bare of their leaves, leaving strange tendrils spiraling up into the sky like skinny fingers trying to poke into the clouds above. A most dreadful sight, and for today, it only seemed to set the stage for what was about to happen. 

For today, there would be bloodshed, most glorious bloodshed.

A wraith like figure emerged from one of the shadows behind one of the towering oak trees, black mist swirling around her paws as she peered out towards the camp entrance of the clan she hated so much, the clan who refused to grant her redemption, the clan who housed the cats who stood against her, the clan that led to her early demise. Today was the day she was enacting her revenge, after all the work she had put into turning their clanmates against them, she had an army standing behind her. Together, they would tear ThunderClan apart.

Silentwing smirked lightly as she glanced behind her, staring at her followers and co-conspirator with a wicked, almost <em>too eager</em> expression. The euphoria of enacting her vengeance that was moons in the making was near, and today would be a momentous occasion. Taking a few steps forward, the former WindClanner entered the tunnel with her army trailing behind her, before she uttered the words.

<strong>”Attack, and show no mercy to your enemies! ThunderClan falls today!”</strong>

Following her wraith like companion, the heavily scarred she cat burst through into the camp as well, a crazed cackle screeching from her throat. 
<strong>&quot;THUNDERCLAN SHALL FALL!!&quot;</strong> She roared, leaping at the first Thunderclan cat she could.</span>

Scenes of injustice replayed in his mind, and the moons of training in the dark forest had prepared him to now deal karma. He wished he could be with Wolfshine now, but he knew she was safer guarding the apprentices than joining in this attack. With a roar of a battle cry, the silver tabby descended upon his clanmates. (open!)
-
Wolfprowl&#39;s head raised at the passionate calls that echoed into the quarry. The eerie sight of the dark forest cats made his fur bristle instantly, and behind them- were those <em>ThunderClan cats</em>? <em>What the-?</em> No sooner than he got to his paws was the gray warrior barreled into by Deerbounce. Instantly they erupted in a flurry of hissing and flying claws. <span class="mention" title="JennyFromTheRift#0113">@Jennstar</span></span>

Unfortunately for Silentwing, ThunderClan had been prepared. The hard-work and dedication of the spies planted within the Dark Forest brought forth preparation for this deadly day ahead. However, her fur still bristled in shock as the dark spirits emerged from the trees, the familiar tortoiseshell leading them with utter confidence. A low growl rumbled in her throat. Her head whipped towards Laurelblaze. <strong>” Gather the warriors. Have a group of them usher the queens, elders, kits and young apprentices to my den and defend them.”</strong> 

Without waiting for a reply, ThunderClan’s leader darted away. Fear mingled in the air and she needed to dispel as much as she can of it. Bounding up the Highledge in great big leaps, Icestar skidded to a halt right on the edge of her perch.

<strong>” ThunderClan!”</strong> She roared out. <strong>” Since when have we been threatened by empty promises?”</strong> Lashing her tail, her fearsome gaze ravaged across her Clanmates. <strong>” Let’s show them exactly what it means to be a warrior of ThunderClan!”</strong>

Crashing into Wolfprowl, the dark forest she cat screeched a battle cry, her ice blue eyes gleaming with insanity as she struck out swipe after swipe. Her sharp claws ripped through his grey fur, and her jaws shot forward, ready to bite the warriors throat. All the while, a wicked grin spread across her face. She was enjoying every second of this.</span>

The day had finally come, and Finchbriar would be finally ascending to her throne as the destined ruler of ThunderClan. She’d prove it to them that they had scorned her, and this was her retaliation, that her dynasty was to begin. <strong>”Down with the weakness of ThunderClan! You shall not escape my wrath!”</strong> she snarled aloud as she followed after Silentwing and Deerbounce, preparing to descend upon her clanmates. (@ anyone)</span>

As chaos exploded around her, the white and ginger shecat heard a familiar voice join the fray. She blinked in a horrified realization as her own clanmate joined these screeching wraiths, ready to turn on her clanmates.

       A cruel thing, time was. And time came interactions, rounding of a character. Like a mass of sedimentary in a flow of water. Over time, it gets shaped. And Finchbrair - or Finch<em>paw</em> as Cypress once knew her as, was shaped with sharp edges. The striped she ran towards her in the speed BearMask had trained her in so long ago. Speed but more so power. Ramming into what she would once call a friend, Cypress pinned her down.

The cream coated feline tensed at the sounds of the raised cries of their....clanmates? Their own clanmates turning against them to side with the Dark Forest. It made her heart sink at the sight, but quickly gathered herself as this was no time to feel sad...they needed to be strong to fight against their former friends. Her chocolate gaze quickly darted around to try and spot Cardinalspark, wanting to be sure if was okay, but there was not anytime to try and join up with him as the traitors began to descend onto the camp. She knew he would be alright....at least she hoped. 

Honeydrop quickly scrambled to her paws, bracing herself for the fight ahead as the other cats began to enter in. Her claws were unsheathed as she was ready to defend herself and her clanmates against those who betrayed them all. Before she was caught up into the fight, she headed over to the nursery to quickly start assisting the queens and kits to Icestar&#39;s den, her body tensed as she kept her gaze moving about to watch for any who might try and attack them.

The fallen rocks from the landslide dug unpleasantly into his spine. With a heaving grunt, he shoved her off of him and sent her crashing a few tail lengths away. <em>Surprisingly heavy, for a ghost.</em> The two-tone tom sprang to his paws and pursued her, looking to pounce. <span class="mention" title="JennyFromTheRift#0113">@Jennstar</span></span>

It was as if a cold chill ran through camp when her sworn enemy finally showed her disgusting face to her at last, finally bringing herself to face her at once. Laurelblaze was ready for this, she would not allow her clan to fall, most certainly not to traitors. Icestar’s orders rang in her ears, and she acknowledged them with a nod. Yet she wouldn’t let these cats get to tear into her clanmates without a few words of her own. <strong>”Do not allow a single one of them to escape! We will not allow these traitors to leave without facing the consequences of their actions!”</strong> she yowled out a battle cry to her clanmates, feeling adrenaline pump through her veins as she felt her fur bristle. It was as if a spark took to a wildfire in an instant, a mere flip of a switch and Laurelblaze was prepared to rip apart her enemies in an instant. A terrifying force on the battlefield, and she wouldn’t show mercy. Not when they betrayed her clan.

She then could see Dustycloud nearby, her son, and she heeded Icestar’s orders. <strong>”Dustycloud! Gather other warriors and get the kits, elders, and young apprentices to safety on the Highledge! Protect them!”</strong>

There wasn’t much time for further words. The corner of her gaze locked onto sudden movement: Needlestripe. An angered snarl ravaged at her throat. Slipping her ivory weaponry out from their sheaths, Icestar whipped around to face the traitor with a lashing tail. <strong>” Think you can get at me that easily?”</strong> She sneered. The cool comment was matched with the furious torrent within her blue-green gaze.

A grunt escaped the crazed she-cats lungs as she was knocked away. She rose to her feet swiftly, her quick movements symbolic of her former days as a Windclan warrior. 
<strong>&quot;How cute.&quot;</strong> she purred dangerously. <strong>&quot;You think you can win?&quot;</strong> before she could speak another word, she lunged forward at him again, leaping onto the warriors back and digging her sharp claws into his shoulders. She growled with a cruel laugh in his ear.
<strong>&quot;Oh, ill enjoy painting your camp with you and your clanmates blood.&quot;</strong> she cackled, preparing to bite his neck.</span>

His brows shot up in shock as wide, fearful amber and blue hues watched the attackers pour into camp. His heart didn&#39;t have time to sink, instead he could swear it had begun to roar in his ears at twice the speed. He froze as adrenaline began to surge through his veins and his breathing hitched. Cats to his left and right were taken down by the attackers, and there was so much blood already. He snapped out of it as the deputy yelled at him to round up the youth and get those who couldn&#39;t fight to safety. That he could do. <em>I can do that.</em> He shared one look with her before launching himself to the nursery. <strong>&quot;Someone grab the elders and get them to Icestars den!&quot;</strong> He called towards a small group of warriors, pleading that they&#39;d follow his orders despite his skittish reputation. He scrambled to the nursery, his usual quiet and stuttered tone sounding loud over the snarls outside. <strong>&quot;Everyone needs to get to the highledge! Get to Icestars den!&quot;</strong> He meowed ushering kits along with their mothers to make sure no one got left behind. He snagged a kitten too afraid to move by the scruff, mentally apologizing for the way he ragdolled in his grip before following the mothers and their young towards Icestars den. Hopefully the others could hold them off long enough so that they could get inside without interruption... <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span>  @uhqueens/kits/elders (open)</span>

The tan tabby hadn&#39;t expected to garner the attention of two of her former clanmates with such vitriol, but she was more than capable of dispatching them with ease. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m bringing my family&#39;s glory and honor back that this clan has just brushed aside, that&#39;s what! Not that you would ever understand!&quot;</strong> she snarled towards Patchheart, her claws sliding out of their sheaths as she prepared for the assault from both cats. <strong>&quot;I think you should be asking that of your clan, when they dishonored my mother and couldn&#39;t even bother to keep her memory alive, that&#39;s what!&quot;</strong> she spat in Cypressgaze&#39;s face, slashing her claws at her face as she attempted to remove her from her pinned form. Her hind legs were scraping at her opponent&#39;s underside, trying to kick her off so she could actually maneuver.

She ducked her clanmates attacks, blocking as best as she could as she stared in horror at the words she spoke. She leaped forward, knocking her off of Cypressgaze with a swipe to her shoulder. 
<strong>&quot;You really have gone mad!! What example are you trying to set by turning on your clanmates!!&quot;</strong> she cried out, orange eyes glaring as she snarled. 
Her eyes gazed at the chaos around the camp, seeming to keep a lingering look on Laurelblaze as she did so. She knew the deputy could hold her own, but a worm of worry turned her stomach. 
<em>Dont let me lose another family member today...please...</em> she begged silently as she turned her focus from her aunt back to her traitorous clanmate.</span>

       Fast, sure. But lacked it nonetheless after a long period of time. Though this behemoth made it up with his brobdingnagian mesomorphic physique. Advantageous, in the shortest term. Though the opponent was one to talk, Alerce happened to not. Couldn&#39;t spare the traitor a breath. 
<strong>&quot;But traitors are the first to go,&quot;</strong> Contradictory. 
    As the set of claws found Alerce&#39;s neck, he couldn&#39;t pull back as much to minimalize damage, so he went forth to headbutt the feline instead.</span>

It had been a relatively quiet day, with dreary clouds resting over the land. Blue eyes were poised upon the dark sky overhead, curious as to whether or not rain would fall from them or if they&#39;d simply reside there until further notice. His gaze caught sight of the patrol moments before they left and he briefly wondered whether or not they were going hunting or looking for their missing clanmates. Something about the way they&#39;d left had seemed important, but both of those things were...the more he tried to think about it, the more confused he became.
    And then, it happened. Suddenly, screams and shouts sounded from the clan&#39;s entrance and before he knew it, the clan had erupted into a mass of fighting. It was as if a storm had unleashed its rage upon them, yowls and screams shattering the earlier silence like thunder, the sound of paws pounding upon the earth, almost seeming to make it shake. Gingerly, the tom arose, his useless leg seeming to drag upon the ground as he arose and made little movement forward. A fight had broken out. They were at war, in a sense. Wide eyes scanned the camp desperately, figuring it&#39;d be best if he stayed out of things for now. If he he was attacked, there was only so much he could do.</span>

       Cypress almost spat out at the fae in disbelief. <em>Not that you would ever understand.</em> And what of Cypress&#39; family? The <em>Shiny</em> family. Humiliated through exile for all to see. Only she and very few others staying in Thunderclan. Cypress knew very well what she meant.
    Being slashed at in the face, Cypress managed to get off, head hanging from the sudden and quick assault that now etched across her features. 
<strong>&quot;You <em>idiot</em>,&quot;</strong> Gander lifted, tears spiked and threatened to spill. Cypress was always an emotional individual. <strong>&quot;Family legacy stays forever, but you seem to be absolutely <em>selfish</em> and ruining it even more with your betrayal!&quot;</strong> A flicker of an audit to PatchHearts direction. Acknowledging them and thanking them silently for the help.</span>

She had to take his attack. Attempting to avoid it would result in her flying off the Highledge which, preferably, Icestar would like to avoid.

The silvery-white molly dug her claws into Needlestripe’s flanks as he gripped her and slammed her right into the stone wall. Gritting her teeth prevented her from crying out as a dull pain numbed along her back. There was too much pride at stake for this one! 

<strong>” That’s the most you can do?”</strong> Her taunt came out breathless. Icestar’s hind legs shifted to reach optimal balance. From there, all her strength could be concentrated on shoving Needlestripe back. Away from his snapping jaws and thorn-sharp claws.

She coughed as the air got knocked out of her, releasing her grip on the toms neck. She regained her composure, snarling as she lunged forward again. 
<strong>&quot;Thunderclan will FALL!&quot;</strong> she shrieked, swiping with her claws full force.

Finchbriar, taking the opportunity to roll back onto her paws after getting Cypressgaze off of her, but not before sustaining another attack from Patchheart. She took a deep breath as she felt blood began to well up around her currently light wounds, though she felt a shred of satisfaction for managing to get a jab in at her opponent&#39;s face. 

Her devilish smirk returned to her features as she began to circle them both, taunting both she-cats with more insults. <strong>&quot;Please, Icestar did the clan a favor by exiling your brood out of here. The only legacy they had was leaving the stench of crowfood everywhere they went and causing nothing but trouble!&quot;</strong> she hissed back towards the two of them, knowing both had been involved with the same family in different ways. <strong>&quot;Maybe you should have a reunion with that family of yours, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re used to seeing dead kits of theirs!&quot;</strong>

A foul insult, one that Finchbriar was going to follow up with a series of quick, but vicious slashes at both of her opponents. She was always more of a swift and agile fighter anyhow, she liked to whittle them down bit by bit.

As Finchbriar spoke, the white and ginger tabby felt her blood boil. 
<strong>&quot;How DARE you!&quot;</strong> she roared, dodging the attacked thrown her way, but wincing as a few hit her shoulders and sides. She leaped forward, knocking Finchbriar back so her belly was exposed, and slashed at her chest. She channeled the skills Laurelblaze had taught her, letting her fury guide her way. 
<strong>&quot;If you really want to honour your familys legacy, there are better ways! All you&#39;re doing is smearing your name in the dirt!&quot;</strong> she roared, orange eyes blazing with rage.</span>

The success of getting him away from her was short-lived. Needlestripe’s canines sunk into her paw with speed that offered little reaction time. Icestar felt herself get dragged forward with ease and stumble into the ground beside the tom. The lynx-point writhed, lashing out with her other paw towards his face. Gouging out his eye was incredibly tempting but she aimed for the muzzle, hoping to leave a bloody trail. She needed to get up as quickly as possible thus freeing her paw was a priority.

Before he could make another move, the head was flying in his direction, Frozenmink letting out a load yowl as it smacked into his muzzle. He could already feel the pain rush through his face, the blood running down to drip off his white chin. <strong>”Fox-dung!”</strong> the warrior cursed, backing up with narrowed pupils.

       She riled with pent up anger within, bubbling and boiling like some enchanted cauldron - but of course, she; a forest cat on adrenaline and rage, did not know this. She wold&#39;ve bitten back, most especially as PatchHeart was targeted as well, but found grounding in the way she sank her claws into the ground as best she could. Little roots, that would not do their niche as soon as a breeze would go over. 
    As PatchHeart offended Finch, Cypress found it in time to make her own; dodging her opponent for once on their wide scaled attacks and grab a hind leg, preventing them from possibly aiming at PatchHeart.</span>

       A battle scar, just great. As if he needed any more. Let&#39;s hope it would be temporary and an easy fix. Key word; hope. By the feels of it, it severed this loyal thunderclanner fairly deep, acquiring a wince from him. But not for long. His headbutt was victorious, the other pressing back with curse laced in vocals. It was Alerce&#39;s turn to feel victorious. But that was saying a lot as both were bleeding from each others violations. 
<strong>&quot;There&#39;s still time to rethink your decisions,&quot;</strong> Mercy in words, but actions made differently; sweeping at FrozenMinks paws in attempt to make them fall as they were distracted. Quick attacks with an unbalancing side effect for the attacked shell. If Alerce had a moment to breathe mortally, perhaps he would have pitied them.</span>

Finchbriar was desperately fighting now, having two cats targeting her at once and holding her to the ground was challenging, but she refused to allow them to take her that easily. Even when she was tired, she would not stop fighting. She&#39;d fight like a cornered animal if it came to it. Growling under her breath, the wounded she-cat slammed her claws into Patchheart&#39;s sides, raking her claws into the flesh on her shoulders as a means to weaken her grip on her, to eventually allow her to push her off of her. She needed to find some way to finish both of her enemies off, but things were looking difficult as of now. <strong>&quot;It&#39;s still better than yours.&quot;</strong> she hissed through gritted teeth, not relenting with her insults and fury. She was here to fight for <em>her</em> future, and these cats would be nothing more than stains on her legacy. An afterthought.

A shriek of pain erupted from the shecats throat as Finchbriar sliced her shoulders and sides. She pushed back, panting as blood trickled and began to stain her white fur. She growled furiously.  
<strong>&quot;At least <em>Im</em> a noble Thunderclan warrior, you two faced traitor.&quot;</strong> she spat, taking a step back to catch her breath as she winced in pain from her wounds.</span>

She twisted away as Needlestripe let go of her paw but the warrior was faster. <em>Damn it!</em> Another snarl, this time of frustration, was let out from within her as he bit down on her throat. Rage filled up within her as he forced her to look down at her fighting Clanmates. Blood sprayed thinly on the ground beneath their paws. Howls of pain and growls of rage echoed violently. They were fighting for their lives. 

<strong>” If you think you can kill me this easily, you’re wrong,”</strong> she growled. If she was going down, he was going down with her. Her body recoiled, gathering up her energy. If she could violently explode in a twisting motion, she could bring him over to the edge. Fortunately, it wasn’t necessary. While Needlestripe gloated in his delusional victory, Icestar noticed something moving behind them.

He couldn&#39;t keep throwing her off every time she came for him. If he was going to win this fight and help the clan, he was going to have to attack first.

Again they became a mess of flying blood, fur, and claws. Whatever Deerbounce had it store for him, he could take it. Wolfprowl became blind to his own attacks and defenses, all the pain blending together in a warm, weirdly comfortable blur of war. <span class="mention" title="JennyFromTheRift#0113">@Jennstar</span></span>

In that moment, Needlestripe hadn&#39;t expected to be facing the wrath of the behemoth deputy herself, viciously attacking him with an onslaught of brutal slashes from her large paws. <strong>&quot;NO!&quot;</strong> she sank her claws into his frame and dragged both cats back from the edge.

<em>There was a reason that many cats did not wish to face her in battle. For she was one of the strongest cats in ThunderClan.</em>

<strong>&quot;You snakehearted...&quot;</strong> one slash, <strong>&quot;Crowfood-eating...&quot;</strong> another slash, <strong>&quot;TRAITOR!&quot;</strong> a third. She was defending her leader from this assailant with fervor, not daring to pull her punches as she ripped into Needlestripe. Icestar needed her support in this moment, and like a good deputy should, she&#39;d go to war for her leader, her friend.

<strong>&quot;I should rip your damn throat out myself for this!&quot;</strong>

       Cypress couldn&#39;t defend PatchHeart from FinchBrais front paws though, and with dropping the hind leg, she made up for her misread moves. 
<strong>&quot;Finch,&quot;</strong> Stepping between the two now. What in Starclan was she doing? <strong>&quot;There&#39;s still time to bring back your family&#39;s legacy. It&#39;s not the end!&quot;</strong> Saying this with a lash of her tail, she was still alert and wary of any potential attacks. But these words? Perhaps it were the ones she herself would have wanted to hear. The Shiny family was dead here in Thunderclan and just so proved; hated as well. <strong>&quot;Remember when we were trying to brainstorm warrior names?&quot;</strong> Conversation was not a place on battle. Bearmask would be disappointed.</span>

He let her fall onto the edge of the cliff while he tumbled backwards. A mass of torbie fur loomed over him, eliciting a golden glare from the tom.

But before he could voice his frustrations, Laurelblaze descended upon him in the form of nonstop slashes. She made quick work of his face, which became criss crossed with fresh crimson tapers. There was no time for him to get up and fight back, only endure the deputy&#39;s fury. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> <span class="mention" title="Iceywicey#3780">@Ice</span></span>

The release of her throat did wonders to her now open airway system. A great inhale of air was taken in through her mouth as she was dropped to the ground in a thud. She lay there for a few heartbeats as she recovered from the slow suffocation. In the meantime, Laurelblaze seemed to make quick work of Needlestripe. <em>Thank StarClan!</em> She was truly grateful for her friend. 

Yet, the deputy wasn’t the only one wishing to have the traitor’s guts spilling out before them. Unfortunately, there were moral grounds to be followed. 

Knowing she can’t roll around on the floor for any longer, Icestar got up to her paws and appeared by Laurelblaze’s side. A quick smirk was sent towards the raging femme but the softening gratitude in her eyes was genuine. Facing Needlestripe, she lashed at his side with a paw. <strong>” You’re a coward,”</strong> she hissed.

She was back to her paws again, coughing as she felt her chest sting from the wounds Patchheart had left there. Any higher and it would have been her throat instead, and she wouldn&#39;t still be standing. Yet it appeared Cypressgaze was attempting some form of mediation, of trying to play to her sense of mercy, by bringing up the past. Of saccharine memories of a better time...

Except it was as if she were a choir singing to an empty audience.

Finchbriar hissed, completely disregarding her former friend&#39;s words, leaping at her as she attempted to tackle her to the ground. She wanted to end this right here, to hell with the past, to hell with her former friends, to hell with ThunderClan! She was leaving it all behind, she gave them up long ago. <strong>&quot;You&#39;re pathetic, and WEAK.&quot;</strong> she hissed in Cypressgaze&#39;s ears as she prepared to attack her once again, sinking her claws into her sides. She just wanted to <em>kill</em> her already.

Though she wasn&#39;t sure if Patchheart would just allow that to happen.

Orange eyes watched carefully as the traitorous clanmate lunged forward at Cypressgaze. Patchheart had had enough. She wasnt about to let this foxhearted fool hurt anyone else. 

In a swift movement, the white and ginger tabby launched forward, leaping and colliding with Finchbriar midair before she had a chance to lay a claw on Cypressgaze. She grappled her to the ground, holding her down strongly as her claws pricked her shoulder and thigh. 

<strong>&quot;Enough is enough, Finchbriar.&quot;</strong> she snarled. <strong>&quot;We&#39;ll see what Laurelblaze and Icestar want to do about this.&quot;</strong> she held her paws firmly, determined not to let her go.</span>

Seeing Needlestripe&#39;s pathetic expression through the gashes she left in his face prompted her to stop, to relent. She wouldn&#39;t kill a cat she knew was defeated, she wasn&#39;t like Silentwing. She knew how to show mercy, even to cats undeserving of it.

<strong>&quot;I grant you your life, and nothing else. If you even try to escape, I will hunt you down and finish you off, do you understand?&quot;</strong> she hissed in the traitor&#39;s ears, her claws finding their way onto his side as she gripped onto him, pushing his frame further into the stone floor of the Highledge, emphasizing her point. She&#39;d gladly give them all a dirt nap if they wished for it.

<strong>&quot;Icestar, are you all right? I can find Marigolddust to see if you need-&quot;</strong>

This moment of peace was soon to be interrupted, for one cat had grown impatient with how it had been progressing

It would be too good to be true if Honeydrop and the other warriors succeeded in taking the vulnerable to safety. Besides, they couldn’t go up there with Laurelblaze and Icestar prancing around bait. A few Dark Forest warriors separated from the convoluted mess of the battle and slipped up the Highledge trail.

<strong>” Leaving the party so soon?”</strong> The smooth voice of Fishflakes arose behind the team of ThunderClan cats. **”

       Empty choir, though in hopes the walls were thin enough to resonate to the outside. To hopefully any open pair of ears.
    But it was as if Finch was wearing sound canceling headphones. Right next to her.
    The offensive attack got to Cypress, the tackle was almost welcomed. Cypress was not masochistic, nor sacrificial, but the down of heart to Finchs refusal to listen. Momentary <em>I give up</em>. And oh how many times BearMask told her to do otherwise. A wince rose from her to the sinking claws, perhaps even a small sound, the rest suppressed. Luckily, PatchHeart was there to end the situation in CypressGazes favor. 
    Getting up, her features were stern, and despite being hurt, disappointed as well.
<strong>&quot;Its a shame really,&quot;</strong> Standing from a stride away. <strong>&quot;I thought you would be involved in my retirement era.&quot;</strong> Eyes fallen on the pinned Finch.</span>

That comment seemed to only strengthen her smirk. <strong>” Just noticed? I’ll show you exactly what a tyrant like me does.”</strong> A slow, menacing step forward was taken as the three of them ceased their attacks. <strong>” We will make your life a living hell.”</strong> Unfortunately for Needlestripe, he was going to have to live for his crimes. 

Icestar watched with narrow eyes as Laurelblaze shoved the traitor to the ground. <strong>” I’m alright,”</strong> she shook out her fur only to pause mid-shake as an ominous figure appeared before them. 

<strong>” Silentwing,”</strong> she hissed.

As every queen, kit, and elder was accounted for in the cramped space, a single cat stood between them and the vicious offenders below. <strong>&quot;Alright-Okay j-just everyone stay in here.&quot;</strong> Dustycloud mewed, trying to keep himself under control at the same time queens hushed their little ones and old cats only shared confused and frightened looks. It wasnt exactly easy. The brown pelt tom had ushered them as far back into the den as possible and stood just inside. He made for an anxious and uncertain guard, but he&#39;d die for any of them and anyone so loyal was still a threat. Dustycloud stood with claws unsheathed, taking a defensive battle stance and preparing himself for enemies to appear.

<strong>”I grow tired of these games, you two…”</strong>

A sickly sweet voice crooned as a spectral tortoiseshell appeared behind both the ThunderClan leader and deputy, her gaze flickering down to the warrior of hers that had clearly failed in his task. <strong>”Pathetic. You were so close and you decided to hesitate, you never say you’ve killed someone before you do so. Honestly.”</strong> she scoffed quietly as she slowly approached the two cats she’d been tormenting for moons, her claws extended and ready to slice through their flesh.

<strong>”For a final battle, this is an excellent place to die. The view is like no other.”</strong> a smirk adorned her features as she finally readied herself to strike, her attention trained on both she-cats. One thing was for certain, she was not going to hold back against them, they had already killed her once, she knew exactly what they were capable of. Mercy was out of the question here.

One moment, she was atop Cypressgaze, the next she was being held down against the ground, unable to fight back, she had been <em>captured</em>. Her eyes widened as she attempted to struggle, to claw her way free as Patchheart held onto her, but she was too weak to fight back, too tired. <em>No, I can’t lose! I can’t lose! I have to, I have to-</em> she peered around the clearing for any sign of Deerbounce, in hopes she may help her. <strong>”D-Deerbounce! Deerbounce please!”</strong> she cried out for her Dark Forest mentor, trying to see if she could gain her support in freeing herself, by taking down these pests. It was her only option left.

<strong>”Deerbounce! Help me! Please! Kill them! Kill them!”</strong>

She had grown bored of playing with Wolfprowl, and turned her attention to the rest of the battle. She watched with pursed lips as Needlestripe was subdued by the leader and deputy, but kept back as her cohort handled it. She then turned her gaze dissappointedly to that of her own apprentice. 
She raised a brow, ice blue eyes almost glaring with disapproval.  
<strong>&quot;To be taken down so easily...i thought id trained you better than that, Finchbriar.&quot;</strong> she shook her head, before movement caught her eye. A young apprentice not too far away. A wicked grin spread across her face. 
<strong>&quot;Seems you need another lesson in strength...watch and learn, and maybe you can get yourself out of your predicament.&quot;</strong> she growled, before barrelling towards the apprentice; Viperpaw.</span>

<strong>” I grow tired of seeing your face behind every evil scheme,”</strong> Icestar chipped in unhelpfully. Having recovered her composure after this wonderful surprise, the lynx-point was back to the confident set of her chin and glaring eyes. She shifted to protectively block Needlestripe from Silentwing’s disappointing gaze. While he had every right to earn it, he was still her Clanmate and she was better than him.

It must have been an amazing view of the sun’s glorious orange rays bursting out from the horizon but Icestar kept her eyes locked on the menace. <strong>” It must be Silentwing. Take it in because that is the last thing you’ll ever see.”</strong> The ThunderClan leader had no qualms against murdering ghosts. They weren’t alive anymore and her claws were itching to slice at that nasty throat of the dappled molly.

The young black tortoiseshell had been caught in the fray, desperately attacking any foe she came across as she had attempted to make her way towards the Highledge. She wasn’t very skilled in fighting yet, and she didn’t want to get killed by doing something completely stupid by picking a fight with a bigger opponent. Yet she was finding herself cornered left and right, trying to weave through the frenzy, but it was hard for a cat as small as she was. She was growing increasingly desperate, struggling to free herself, and it was terrifying.

And now she had only drawn the attention of a Dark Forest warrior, while one of her mothers was fighting nearby. <strong>”Mother! Mother help!”</strong> she cried out for Hollyfrost, before her gaze met Deerbounce’s, never feeling more fear in her life in this moment.

Running as fast as her legs could carry her, Wrenpaw burst through the entrance of the ThunderClan camp, fur bristling and lips curled in a snarl. A gory scene unfolded before her orange gaze. Everywhere she looked her clanmates were immersed in battle — a sea of writhing bodies and a symphony of furious caterwauls. The caramel fem hesitated briefly, unsure of where to insert herself. The clearing had transcended into utter chaos, and the apprentice’s mind was racing. 

Another apprentice was going head to head with a dark forest cat, holding their own but perhaps in need of some assistance. Wrenpaw was eager to get her paws dirty, and show everyone that she was stronger than they thought. She threw herself at the unsuspecting feline, trampling them to the ground and unleashing a round of heavy blows before leaping out of harms way, looking for her next opponent as the previous one fled from battle.

Rushing into battle, the she-cat frantically looked for Needlestripe. Where could he be? Her fur stood on end as she spotted Silentwing among the bustle of cats. If she found out she failed.. she would be done for.
<strong>” Don’t worry my babies,”</strong> she whispered to her belly, <strong>” I will keep you all safe.”</strong>
She would have to look for Needlestripe later. For right now she had to hide- for the sake of her kits.
She looked around for a crevice to hide in. Finding a bush, she crawled behind it and watched as the battle continued.

It would be too good to be true if no Dark Forest warrior neared the leader’s den that temporarily housed the vulnerable. Leading a group of his fellow comrades with him, Fishflake slunk up the Highledge trail. While Silentwing and Needlestripe distracted the two highranks of this wretched Clan, his team was going to strike where it would hurt the most. The prospect of digging his claws into kit flesh was enough to send a pleasant chill through his body.

Since these cats were already dead, he made sure that each strike was made with the intent to kill, and in a matter of only a few minutes, he had already dispatched five undead warriors (because he’s so cool and awesome and epic and awesome). <strong>“You guys sounded more dangerous in stories,”</strong> he said with a battle-hungry grin as he finished another cat he had pinned off, tearing out their throat.

The training he’d done with Eaglewing was paying off. He was stronger than ever. Now was hardly the time to praise himself for it though. He needed to look for the final boss, Silentwing. If he took out the Dark Forest cats’ leader, they would be weaker than ever. Bearmask scanned the area, trying to make out the feline he’d seen once during the WindClan raid moons ago.</span>

He had been chasing after Wolfshine after she’d escaped from the makeshift den, despite the wound in his shoulder. She had captured his friend, held her prisoner, and he wasn’t going to let her forget it! <strong>”I won’t let you escape, Wolfshine! You’ll pay for what you’ve done!”</strong> he hissed as he charged into the clearing, a gasp escaping his jaws as he saw the bloodshed and chaos. <em>StarClan… What is going on here?!</em> he was panting from his sprint, ears flattened against his skull as he tried to locate Wolfshine in the camp, but to no avail, so far.

<strong>”Show yourself! You coward! You can’t hide from ThunderClan!”</strong>

The wraith like shecat hissed in annoyance as she was stopped by the black furred warrior before she could lay claws on the apprentice.  She growled, her ice blue eyes lit with a crazed fury. 

<strong>&quot;How pathetic. Does Thunderclan not bother to train their young? Always have to have someone come to your defense.&quot;</strong> she rolled her eyes, before a crazed cackle erupted. <strong>&quot;Well, this will fun nonetheless.&quot;</strong> she grinned, before disappearing in the shadows.
A moment later, she appeared again,  this time at Hollyfrosts side. She sank her claws into the strong warriors shoulders, using her back claws to rake her rear.</span>

Trying to stay hidden, Wolfshine stiffened as she heard the sounds of Coyotepaw after her. Why couldn’t he just leave her alone?
If anyone found her here, she would be crowfood. She had to confront him.
Stepping out from behind the bush, she looked at the apprentice with darkened eyes.
<strong>” So you’ve found me Coyotepaw. Congratulations, you have the makings of a true Thunderclan warrior.”</strong> she glanced down at her stomach, <strong>” I have a secret to tell you- and you can’t tell anyone. I’m having kits. If you attack me, or call someone to kill me now,They’ll die along with me. Do us both a favor, leave me. Leave me here and Starclan won’t have to punish you for taking the innocent lives inside me.”</strong> she tried to hide her fur bristling. Would it be enough to stop him?

The young tortoiseshell was panting, her mottled fur bristling as she saw her mother come to her aid, viciously attacking the strange cat who’d targeted her. She gulped as she took a step back, but she didn’t want to leave her mother to fight this cat alone, not when she called for help… She had to fight too! <strong>”Get off of her you… You piece of rat-dung!”</strong> she cursed aloud, insulting the Dark Forest she-cat as she sprang at her, clamping her jaws down onto one of her hindlegs, alarmed to not be tasting blood in her mouth.

<em>W-What? Why isn’t she bleeding? Why does she reek of death?</em>

Viperpaw’s eyes widened in shock as she held on, not knowing what to make of Deerbounce, and why her attacks seemed to just be phasing through her, or were they?

He had managed to locate Wolfshine behind a bush in camp, and here she was, pleading for her life. His ears flattened against his skull as Wolfshine gave her reasoning, and he stared down at her, gulping out of hesitation. He couldn’t leave her to escape, she needed to be captured, to answer for her crimes! <strong>”I-I…”</strong> he felt guilt well up in his chest, his leaf-green gaze widening. <strong>”I won’t kill you… But I can’t let you leave. I won’t allow it, you need to stay and pay for your crimes. I won’t be responsible for killing unborn kits.”</strong> he winced at the thought, before staring back out at the scene playing out in camp… He’d have to stay here for now, to keep an eye on the pregnant queen. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

It would be too good to be true if Honeydrop and the other warriors succeeded in taking the vulnerable to safety. Besides, they couldn’t go up there with Laurelblaze and Icestar prancing around bait. A few Dark Forest warriors separated from the convoluted mess of the battle and slipped up the Highledge trail.

<strong>” Leaving the party so soon?”</strong> The smooth voice of Fishflakes arose behind the team of ThunderClan cats. **”

Honeydrop stiffened at the sound of the feline&#39;s voice, making her tense as she quickly placed herself in between the attackers and the vulnerable clanmates. <strong>&quot;You will pay dearly for attacking us.&quot;</strong> She hissed, trying to stand strong and firm even though she was afraid. She was the type of cat to try and solve arguments by calmly talking but this was way past making casual chitchat to end the battle. Only fighting would result in it being finished.

The voice of the point dragged Silentwing&#39;s eyes off of her hopeless choice of an ally and onto the leader.  A hint of amusement sparked in her eyes, although behind it, annoyance over their lack in efficient success still stormed, although she knew that this was all just a delay in her plans.  Cats were fighting for their lives, but those of which who were fighting for her own goals would finish successful.  Even if some cats, such as Needlestripe, were weak links.  <em><strong><em>&quot;But, why?  Seeing appearance of my beauty must not be much of an annoyance at all- although, I can&#39;t say the same for yours.&quot;</em></strong></em> she purred, a murderous spark lighting behind her optics as she spoke.  There was nothing else she wanted more than to finish off these <em>bastards.</em> The nerves these cats had would be ended soon, along with their legacy.  

               <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, don&#39;t you have confidence?&quot;</em></strong></em> She commented, adjusting her deathly form as she examined the two cats in front of her.  With a flick of her tail, and a quick glance over the leader and deputy, Silentwing spoke the last words she planned for them to hear; at least, before they were bleeding from the throats on their own home grounds.  <em><strong><em>&quot;It&#39;s too bad you didn&#39;t take your own advice.&quot;</em></strong></em> She said, and at long last, she let herself fly- specifically, onto Icestar.

By the time Hollowgrove charged into camp, bloodied and wounded, a horrid sight met her eyes. A large battle had taken place in her absence. Her gaze flickered over both Thunderclanners and traitors. Even a few Dark Forest cats were here. <em>Perfect.</em> Though her tone had been a sarcastic one, perhaps this would be exactly what they needed. Blood pooled in various places, the stench of it wafting into her nose. She began to bear her fangs, searching for her next target as she was now bloodthirsty. <em>I&#39;ve taken out one..why not anoth-</em>
    A sudden force rammed into her, causing her to hit the ground rather awkwardly. Quickly regaining herself, the tabby rolled and arose again, thrashing about violently. <strong>&quot;Why you little demon!&quot;</strong> she shrieked, attempting to connect a blow. Her claws lashed out at Wrenpaw, already slick with blood. She wasn&#39;t about to allow herself to get beaten by one of their own former prisoners. If anything, she&#39;d take this one out just as swiftly as Tigerspring.

Wrenpaw recoiled at the heavy blow dealt by Hollowgrove, though only momentarily as she prepared herself for this battle. Hollowgrove was no doubt a formidable warrior, but Wrenpaw was determined to prove herself, and planned to put everything she had learned in the Dark Forest to good use. <strong>”You’re a no good, filthy traitor!”</strong> She screeched, throwing herself at the warrior with every ounce of strength her hind legs could muster. Even if Wrenpaw was no match for this cat, there was no way she was going down without a fight. She wasn’t going to make this easy on the Dark Forest loyalist. <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span></span>

The dark forest warrior snickered as the apprentice sank her teeth into her hind leg. <strong>&quot;Pathetic.&quot;</strong> she sneered, before kicking out with said leg, sending Viperpaw rolling backwards. 

She gasped in breathlessness as she was slammed against the wall, loosening her grip on the black she cat. She snarled, leaping forward again and slashing her claws at Hollyfrosts shoulders, bloodlust fueling her movements.</span>

Hollowgrove knew that she could make quick work of this apprentice, but having already battled another feline, the warrior already had lost some of her energy and thus, it would take a bit more effort than usual. With a snarl, Hollowgrove was brought to the ground, tumbling over and over as the two felines fought. <strong>&quot;Traitor? Your clan deserves this!&quot;</strong> she cried, attempting to aim little blows here and there. The braided tabby&#39;s eyes narrowed as the two somewhat paused in their progression, a hissing bundle of fur.
    <strong>&quot;Some nerve you have coming after one of those who held you hostage!&quot;</strong> came a hiss from the warrior, as she bit down on Wrenpaw&#39;s ear. She didn&#39;t hesitate to hold back, ripping it violently as scarlet sprayed from it, beginning to ooze out. Now, she raised a paw to attempt to whack the apprentice. There&#39;d be no mercy shown and she&#39;d learn that quickly.

Silentwing wasn’t just here to talk. That was obvious considering the malicious femme brought an entire army with her. Subtly, Icestar’s paws shifted into position. She couldn’t fool around like she did with Needlestripe. To have survived this long, either the tortoiseshell was a coward or formidable. The latter was more likely considering she wiped out a good number of ThunderClan warriors with her own claws. 

Her gaze darkened significantly, the sea-coloured embers of her eyes sparking as Silentwing attacked. This time, she didn’t allow herself to be captured by any slicing claws. Icestar reared back and spun out of the way. Gaining momentum with the added bonus of gravity, she slammed her white mittens down onto Silentwing’s own paws. <strong>” I think you’re wrong,”</strong> she hissed into the ghost’s ears.

She stiffened at the familiar sound of her former friend, approaching them with the intent on killing them both. Her stance grew firmer as she turned to face the other tortoiseshell, fury blazing in her odd gaze as she stared her down. Her fur was raggedy from battle, but she was hardly weakened, for she had been preparing for this moment. It was either them or Silentwing, and today would decide who got to walk away from this. <strong>”One last dance, and we’ll see who is truly the victor.”</strong> her growl was low, and her fur began to rise along her hackles and spine, framing her out like a glorious mane. She was prepared to die for her clan if it came to it.

But she was more prepared to finally end Silentwing’s life, if it meant her clan would get to live another day.

<strong>”Go crawl back into the hole you came out of, foxheart.”</strong> she hissed as she lunged at the Dark Forest she-cat who’d targeted Icestar first, preparing an onslaught of vicious slashes to take her down. 

No mercy, not for a cat who’d killed more cats than she could count on her claws.

A loud screech erupted from Wrenpaw’s jaws, a mixture of horrible pain and fury as her ear was torn away from her skull, blood gushing down the side of her face. She leaped away from the warrior, staggering slightly as pain shot through her body. <strong>”You piece of crow food, you’ll pay for everything that you’ve done!”</strong> She howled, throwing herself back towards Hollowgrove, driven by hatred and fury. She struck out, aiming the heaviest blows she could manage before inevitably being overthrown by the larger cat once more. 

<strong>”Did you ever stop to think that I came after you <em>because</em> you held me captive you flea pelt? You’ll regret underestimating me!”</strong> She screeched, desperately trying to land blows on any part of Hollowgrove that she could reach. <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span></span>

As she was sent rolling backwards, Viperpaw shook out her fur as she tried to rid if of any dirt before she launched herself back towards Deerbounce, desperately trying to assist her mother… Who looked bloodied, badly bloodied.

<strong>”I won’t let you hurt her! I’ll tear your heart out!”</strong> she was mostly all talk considering how small she was and inexperienced in battle, but she was going to protect her mother, of course she had to sound tough? <strong>”You hear me? I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you dead for this!”</strong> ever the fierce little fighter, Viperpaw was summoning all of her courage to fight for her mother, to defend her.

<em>She threw herself in front of her to save me. I can’t… I can’t let her fight this battle alone!</em>

Viperpaw began to try and scrape at Deerbounce’s side, targeting her while her mother had her slammed against the wall, they could defeat her together!

A feeling of satisfaction arose within the molly, as a screech came from Wrenpaw. <em>That&#39;ll show her.</em> She grimaced as the apprentice connected a heavy blow to her face, the feeling of warm blood seeping out of the fresh wound. With a low growl, the warrior threw the apprentice off of her, watching as she tumbled onto the ground a short distance away. She was just as annoying as Tigerspring was, if not more so.
    <strong>&quot;Oh really? You&#39;re making a fool of yourself!&quot;</strong> a harsh bark of laughter sounded from Hollowgrove as she leapt at the apprentices, claws outstretched as she brought her down upon the ground again, slicing her claws down between her shoulders. She then leaped away, lashing out with a kick toward her hindquarters as she did so to prevent her from simply connecting another blow from behind her - or at least, to keep her from doing so as quickly.

Silentwing&#39;s intended outcome came out unsuccessful, at the moment, at least.  First, her paws collided with those of Icestar&#39;s for just a moment, but before she could make much of a move, she was pushed away by paws of a bit of a larger size.  A scowl spread across her maw and a hiss exited her throat just before she was about to hit the ground.  But, by now, she was far too experienced.  As the ground came closer, Silentwing moved her legs just in time, catching herself with her shoulders in a much less painful landing.  As she felt her limbs touch the browning grass beneath, she sprung up with a quick, strong motion, pushing the hulking deputy enough to put her off of her footing for a moment.  With the small moment, she took her chance and escaped from Laurelblaze&#39;s grasp, even if it was only for a few seconds.  She could feel where she would one time have seen crimson, aware of the claws digging into her flank with the attack.</span>

            Initially, ending Icestar had been Silentwing&#39;s goal.  But changing her sights onto the larger of the two would get one problem out of the way.  This was only going to delay her success, and she was aware of that.  Despite how agitating it was, Silentwing would discard this challenge just as she had in the past.  Laurelblaze was a recurring problem, one that she had just failed to get rid of until now.  But she wouldn&#39;t let the deputy&#39;s existence roam on much longer, not on the earth that she calls home.  No, this would be the end of her, Icestar, and Thunderclan as a whole.  The thought brought a wicked smile to her face, the charm fading for a moment as she imagined the deaths she could give the cats in front of her.  <em><strong><em>&quot;That&#39;s a dance that I&#39;ll win, and a hole you&#39;ll join.&quot;</em></strong></em> She hissed, before leaping towards Laurelblaze.  She knew by now that Laurelblaze couldn&#39;t be killed in one swoop like Beetlestreak had at Deerbounce&#39;s paws, and so she would try a different approach.  Springing to the side, Silentwing used the ground to push off of, causing her to fly towards Laurelblaze&#39;s legs, claws unsheathed and ready.  What was a giant, anyhow, without her legs?

The caramel furred molly crumpled to the earth as she was thrown by the warrior. Her ear was throbbing with pain and her muscles burning with exhaustion. The apprentice had never fought like this in her life. She thought back to a time when she was much more innocent, when she had admitted to Marigolddust how scared she was to be in her first battle. She had never expected it to be anything like this. Battling the most ruthless cats to walk the forest, fighting for her life. 

A life she realized could easily be stolen from her today. 

She writhed and thrashed, snarling viciously as Hollowgrove came crashing down on top of her, more painful caterwauls echoing from her as claws tore down her spine between her flanks. Searing pain shot through her, and for a moment her vision went blurry. There was no way she was going to win this fight, no matter how hard or valiantly she fought — she was simply outmatched. She groaned as the weight of the warrior lifted from her and a hefty kick was dealt to her hindquarters, dragging herself to her paws once more. <strong>”You’re the one who looks like a fool. I’ll fight you until my last breath leaves my body. For ThunderClan.”</strong> She said. 

It was clear that the apprentice was on her last legs. Blood still poured from her ear, and now crimson streams flowed down both of her shoulders, staining her golden fur. <strong>”Come on, traitor. Give me your worst,”</strong> she taunted, now poised and ready for the next attack. If she was going to die now, she was going to go out with claws flying and teeth snapping. <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span></span>

Did Silentwing seriously think she could take on the two of them on her own? If this was her grand scheme to end their reign as ThunderClan’s highranks, she was doing quite a terrible job. 

<strong>” You must truly have several loose screws,”</strong> Icestar commented as Laurelblaze slammed into their opponent and sent the two of them flying off. The fury was radiating off of the calico and Icestar knew that her own was equal in magnitude. She had enough of Silentwing harming anyone. She was a pest that needed to be extinguished.

Bursting into action, Icestar slipped underneath Silentwing before the deceased femme could reach Laurelblaze’s legs. A quick rake with her claws and the lynx-point slipped back out with ease. A simple but effective attack that left blood beading out from the trail she had made on the pale stomach. The more complex ones were for when Silentwing really pissed her off which wouldn’t take much longer.

The burly young tom had been fighting through the sea of traitors swarming their camp, scratches and bite wounds lining his frame as he was fighting his way through towards a particular warrior holding an apprentice in a death grip. He had to be quick, he had to help! Almost as if he were swooping in before Hollowgrove could deal a full-on death blow to Wrenpaw, Shrikecatcher leapt onto the she-cat and sank his long claws into her frame. <strong>”You’re not harming anyone today, bud!”</strong> he hissed as he shoved the other warrior off of Wrenpaw’s form, his blue-gray tabby fur bristling as he confronted Hollowgrove. Now was the time to step in and save another’s life, he had to help!

<strong>”Go! Get to safety, you’ve fought hard enough!”</strong> he turned back towards the caramel molly laying down on the ground below. <strong>”I’ll handle Hollowgrove, go! Get to Marigolddust!”</strong> he flashed her an easy-going smile, ever the positive warrior in the face of adversity. He’d provide her a distraction so she could get to safety. It was time for Hollowgrove to pick on a warrior her own size.

As the two Thunderclan cats fought her side by side, Deerbounce narrowed her gaze. She was growing tired of this. Their side was losing, becoming ever more apparent by the fact that their prisoners had escaped and joined the fray. <em>These cats are useless...</em> she thought bitterly. She had had enough.

She whipped around, decking Viperpaw across her head with her paw, blood spraying as her claws sliced just above the apprentices eye. She sent her flying away, before turning back to the bloody black furred warrior. 

<strong>&quot;Ive had my fun...lets finish this, shall we?&quot;</strong> she purred in a sickly sweet voice, before launching herself full force at Hollyfrost once more. Her paws landed square on the warriors chest, propelling her straight into the rocky wall that marked the edge of Thunderclans camp. There was a sickening thud that rang out as Hollyfrosts skull crashed against the rock.
Deerbounce grinned maliciously, eyes filled with hatred and bloodlust.</span>

This was all too easy. As she whipped around to face the apprentice, half expecting to meet claws in front of her face, Hollowgrove was met with something else. Wrenpaw still laid upon the ground, a scarlet pool already beginning to form around her. Was this really the end of her so soon? Honestly? The warrior allowed for a cruel sneer to appear on her face, watching as the molly managed to rise. But her mere posture and gaze betrayed her - there wasn&#39;t much life left in her, regardless of her words. And she knew it. They both did.
    <strong>&quot;Seems like you will. Some would deem your actions brave, admirable even.&quot;</strong> she spat, eyes poised upon the same spot where she&#39;d laid the final blow against Tigerspring. <strong>&quot;But they are merely foolish actions. Ones that&#39;ll end you.&quot;</strong> As the warrior stalked forward, her tail lashed out behind her, her fangs slowly appearing and jaws beginning to part. Yet she paused a pace or two from the apprentice, as if taunting her. An odd look appeared in her gaze.
    <strong>&quot;My worst? My dear...you&#39;ve requested death.&quot;</strong> As quick as lightning, Hollowgrove bolted forward and with an unsheathed claw, sliced Wrenpaw&#39;s neck. Believing that would be the end of her, the warriors whipped around, perhaps for a final blow...only to be knocked away. A grunt sounded from her as she hit the ground, the stinging feeling of claws sinking into her causing her to grimace, a hiss escaping her. <strong>&quot;And yet another fool...you will pay for your actions! I was doing her a favor!&quot;</strong> she cried, lashing out at the tom with an unsheathed paw, just as he turned his attention back to her. No one was going to ruin this for her! No one.

<em>My dear… you’ve requested death.</em> Perhaps she had. For all Wrenpaw knew, today would be her last. She was terrified. She tried to defend herself from Hollowgrove’s final blow, but she wasn’t fast enough. Claws ripped through the skin on her throat, and yet another stream of crimson bathed the ivory fur on Wrenpaw’s chest. The wound was deep, but lucky for the apprentice it was just shallow enough to prevent her from bleeding every scarlet drop from her body. That was, until Hollowgrove prepared for another blow. Wrenpaw winced, sending a silent prayer to StarClan as she prepared herself for the end. Alas, the blow never came. Orange eyes opened to see Shrikecatcher batting Hollowgrove away, and a shaky sigh of relief left the apprentice’s chest. <em>Get to Marigolddust!</em> Wrenpaw’s eyes widened. She hadn’t even seen the tuxedo in days, and a sudden wave of worry washed over her. She stumbled, sticky and warm with her own blood in the direction of his den. Would he even be there? 

Her breaths were ragged as she limped pathetically through the crowd of cats, tears welling up in her eyes. <strong>”Marigolddust! Marigolddust, help me!</strong>” She cried, using all of her effort to make the words loud enough to hear over the battle cries. <em>Please let him be okay. Please let him find me,</em> she thought desperately. She’d almost reached the medicine den when her legs failed her, and she slumped to the earth in a pool of her own blood. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

The ThunderClan deputy snarled as Silentwing managed to escape from her grip, only to be targeted next. Her fur was bristling, and she went back on the offensive when Icestar had decided to thwart Silentwing’s attempt of an attack against her legs. <strong>”Well, you’re losing your touch, Silentwing. Can’t even keep up with me of all cats!”</strong> she scrunched up her nose as she taunted her enemy, preparing to pounce on her and attempt to tackle her to the ground, if she didn’t slip out of her range before she could. They needed to finish her, so they never had to see her ugly mug ever again. They lost too many cats to her, too many friends, family members, they had to see to it that they received proper justice. To know their killer would never again bring harm to another living being.

<em>For Cloverhill, and Reedshine…</em>

Laurelblaze yowled as she began her onslaught, charging at the former WindClanner with nothing but pure hatred in her gaze as she attempted her tackle, her paws outstretched as she launched herself at her. They were not going to hesitate, they had to fight for their lives here!

She’d been following her mother’s orders, aiming low at Deerbounce’s sides, until she was suddenly slashed over her left eye, causing her to screech from pain. In it, all she could see was red, but her vision in with was blurry— but it was from the blood that was blinding her in that eye. It was the lid that was slashed, not the eye itself. She tried to wipe away her blood that was streaming into her line of sight, shaking her head from the pain of the slash as she attempted to come back to her mother’s aid… Only to hear a loud <em>thud</em> as her mother was slammed against the stone wall of the quarry— murderous intent in the other she-cat’s gaze.

<strong>”No…”</strong> she whispered aloud, her eyes widening as she felt tears welling up around her gaze as she stared up at Deerbounce, before it was replaced with pure and utter rage. She let out a loud cry of fury, pain evidently straining her voice as she threw herself at her mother’s assailant. <strong>”You’ll pay for that! Every last wound on her body! I’ll destroy you! I’ll rip your head off!”</strong> she was yowling, assuming the worst of her mother’s fate, she was acting reckless… But what else could she do? She had to fight to avenge her family, to protect them from the enemies set on destroying them. She wouldn’t allow them to escape.

<strong>”I may be a fool, but I know for certain I’m much smarter than you are than to betray ThunderClan!” The blue-gray tabby tom had to keep Hollowgrove from trying to capture Wrenpaw and harming her further, he’d give her a good thrashing she wouldn’t forget. </strong>”You know, you’re pretty cowardly for targeting an apprentice who isn’t even nearly as experienced in fighting as you are. Talk about being a total wimp!”<strong> he was taunting Hollowgrove to keep her attention drawn on him. So what if he took a few blows, he was strong enough to take it. He was big, and he could take it, he had to be a shield here so Wrenpaw and the others could escape. </strong>”I think you should just give up already, your buddies have already been captured, you think you can take an entire clan by yourself? I don’t think so!”** he smirked lightly as he aimed a few blows at her back and shoulders, trying to knock her to the ground. He wasn’t one for murder, so he’d be trying to hold back, but he did want to try and restrain her if he could… Unless she didn’t give him a choice but to strike her down.

The warrior and apprentices of the clan had received a task they didn&#39;t expect, or deserve, that day.  Battle had spring out through the camp after the capture of the apprentices assigned to spy on the traitors and their ring masters.  Now, fighting had broken out everywhere, cats of darkness and betrayal against those of flesh and nobility.  Marigolddust was not among the many fighting.  No, he was far too weak to fight, and although he was in as much danger as all of his clanmates, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to unsheathe his claws and play the offensive side.  Clan rules didn&#39;t apply here, yet he couldn&#39;t protect himself and jump into the fight.  Instead, he was gathering up all of the elders, kits, and queens that he could, bringing them into his den in hopes of providing them safety.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Come on!  Into my den- it should be safer here,&quot;</em></strong></em> he called, hushing a queen and her kits into the den he had come to call home.  If the den was attacked, he would need to try and finally bring out his teeth and his claws, but he offered them an unsuccessful attempt at a reassuring smile as they joined the others in his den.  It was filling up, but it had to make do.</span>

                  Suddenly, his attention was dragged away and brought to the desperate call of a familiar voice.  His attention snapped to Wrenpaw, and when his eyes landed on her, his heart stopped.  It felt as if he was stuck in a pool of tar as he ran to his apprentice&#39;s side.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Oh Starclan, Wrenpaw!  What happened?  Stay awake, stay awake-&quot;</em></strong></em> he ordered, his voice seriously strict and panicky.  He was terrified as he realized rushed her into his den, trying to keep her out of the sight of the kits but also hurrying.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I-t&#39;ll be okay, just- just dont close you&#39;re eyes, okay?  It&#39;ll be fine, I-I promise..&quot;</em></strong></em> he choked, trying to hold back forming tears as he brought her to his pile of moss balls to try and find some wet moss for his dying apprentice.

Yet another blow connecting. Hollowgrove could hardly stand it. Out of the corner of her gaze, she watched as Wrenpaw made her way toward the medicine cat den, her bloodied form seeming to stagger with any step. She was waiting, waiting...but her form was quickly lost in the crowd of battling felines, leaving the molly without knowledge on whether or not her wounds had truly been the death of her. No matter, for she had something else to worry about...namely, this warrior who believed he would be able to take her down.
    <strong>&quot;Oh really? I&#39;ll have you know she asked for it, otherwise I would&#39;ve left her alone to die by the claws of another.&quot;</strong> she replied in turn, her frown deepening at the tom&#39;s taunts. So he was one of those fighters, hm? Being one to talk a whole bunch of smack yet displaying no sort of skill. A huff sounded from her, scarlet drops falling upon the ground as she stared down her target. <strong>&quot;Oh? And face death?&quot;</strong> a cackle rose from her. <strong>&quot;I don&#39;t believe so! I&#39;ll kill you before I do anything else!&quot;</strong> she cried, aiming another blow at the tom, before stumbling a pace or so away. <em>Silentwing...Deerbounce...</em> She couldn&#39;t fail them. And had his words been true? Had the others already fallen so quickly? <em>Shows their weakness. I&#39;ll stand til the end.</em> Breath becoming ragged once more, she forced it to even out. <strong>&quot;Who knows. With the power of those who unleashed this upon your clan, I just might. One cat at a time.&quot;</strong> Again, she lashed out, whipping about to kick the tom, perhaps able to knock him off balance. There was no way she&#39;d be going down so easily. Not now, not ever.

The attack was unsuccessful.  Again.  Silentwing scowled as Icestar got in the way of her offense against Laurelblaze, sending her claws across the dark forest cat&#39;s flank.  Releasing a loud hiss, Silentwing quickly turned towards the leader.  Unlike what she had originally planned, it didn&#39;t seem like this would be a battle she could win by going one-on-one with the deputy and the leader separately.  They were taking the route that was far more effective, if not pitiful.  If a cat were to take another&#39;s life, she should get the credit, not some cat who might have been of assistance.  It was weak, leaving a battle to be won half-way by claws that were not your own.  Silentwing&#39;s glare disappeared behind a threatingly playful one, an expression daring Icestar to attack.  She had returned her cool, momentarily.  She shouldn&#39;t have lost it in the first place, although secretly, it still stood strong.  Confident charm was a good cover-up, and although the charm might have been a bit empty, her confidence was not.  These cats could try.  They could try over and over again.  But they wouldn&#39;t win, because she had a trick they could never imagine.  She just had to wait for the right time, the right place, and the right cat.  These two were both strong candidates, but she only had one feline in mind.  At least, for the show she would put on for everyone else present.  They will live to share the story of her name, and she would get the glory she had come to claim.</span>

              A spark of cruel excitement flashed across her face at Icestar&#39;s comment.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Loose screws are a small price to pay, darling,&quot;</em></strong></em> she hummed, before Laurelblaze&#39;s voice met her ears once more.  Turning to face the deputy, a wicked smile displayed on her features, a smile which wavered ever so slightly at Laurelblaze&#39;s comment, a bit of her annoyance peeking through once more, although it was covered up again as quickly as one would cover up a truth with a lie.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Fighting with words?  You can do so much better,&quot;</em></strong></em> she commented cool-headedly, giving the tortoiseshell a sickeningly teasing wink.  Her eyes stayed on the mismatched gaze of the cat she had once called a friend- a friend who had betrayed her in the end.  Silentwing let the satsifactory idea of bringing this clan to an end once and for all fuel her next move; an attack to Laurelblaze&#39;s token Silentwing had left her, decorating her chest.  But the move had too much arrogance behind it, and she had been too confident in herself the moment she sprang.  She noticed the mistake as soon as her paws left the ground, but it was too late to fix it.  She had given them an opening point.

It was time for her to end this once and for all, and as she leaped towards Silentwing with her paws outstretched, she couldn&#39;t help but to notice that she was <em>smiling</em>. Not staring up at her in fear, but she was <em>smiling</em>.

She knew something that she didn&#39;t.

She got too cocky.

She let her emotions get the better of her.

Laurelblaze couldn&#39;t stop her attack mid-flight, for she was aiming directly towards Silentwing, her underside vulnerable to attack from the she-cat below, the fatal flaw of a grandiose tackle from above. A weakness that could easily be exploited, was Silentwing going to strike at her here? Was this it? What was she planning?

Laurelblaze couldn&#39;t predict what she was going to do, and most certainly not what the Dark Forest tortoiseshell had planned next...

Despite the poor leap off of the ground on Silentwing&#39;s part, she didn&#39;t need a good pounce in order to complete what she had in mind.  She needed to get Laurelblaze out of the picture, even if doing so meant that Icestar&#39;s end had to wait a moment.  Silentwing and Laurelblaze had unfinished business, and perhaps that would end here, before it ended for the leader that could only watch as Silentwing finally reached Laurelblaze.  

             Rather than land on top of Laurelblaze or sending a deadly blow down onto Laurelblaze&#39;s throat, she kept her sights on the scars on the tortoiseshell&#39;s chest, landing on the ground rather than on her opponent.  Giving such a killing blow would be too quick, not nearly as effective as she wanted Laurelblaze&#39;s last moments to be.  No, instead of digging claws into flesh, Silentwing thrust a paw into Laurelblaze&#39;s chest.  The attack would be anything but expected, and it was a trick that Silentwing had been keepinh in secret to display in this moment.  Or, rather, a future moment.  This would just be a little show, a display for all of the cats around them; an event that would make the cats of Thunderclan fear her as they should.  Silentwing&#39;s smile widened as her eyes stayed on Laurelblaze&#39;s, an evil and knowing look in her eye.  Now was her time.  Silentwing&#39;s paw was no longer visible, being hidden by the flesh and fur of Laurelblaze&#39;s chest.  Silentwing didn&#39;t stop until she could feel the power of the fragile organ beating in the deputy&#39;s chest, and once she could feel the power of fists beating against her paw, she closed her claws around it.  With one quick, powerful movement, Silentwing pulled against the power her claws had hooked around, bringing it part way out of Laurelblaze&#39;s form and into the open.</span>

              Silentwing didn&#39;t let go of this new force that she had trapped in her grasp, and instead, she examined it with satisfied pride.  Laurelblaze&#39;s soul was trapped between her clawed toes, unable to escape the grape of the dark forest cat.  No look of surprise or fear was shown on the Windclanner&#39;s face as she took in her work, and a large grin was displayed instead as her dark, cold eyes met Icestar&#39;s.  The deputy&#39;s soul was still connected to her body, only part way out of her chest, but it was enough of an event to give any cat a scare.  Silentwing&#39;s crazed joy in the sight of it was just the cherry on the top.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, what do you think?  I learned a trick or two during my time in that forest you seem to despise so much.  I don&#39;t know, I kinda like it, hm?&quot;</em></strong></em> She spoke the words casually, an unsettling chill filling blanketing her tone.

Everything happened too fast for her mind to process. The inviting glare of Silentwing was enough for Icestar to leap forward. That was when it all came down. The swipe of the Dark Forest warrior’s at Laurelblaze’s exposed chest. The deputy’s counter-attack and their collision. Something wasn’t right. With a darkened expression on her masked face, Icestar skidded to a halt, sending stray pebbles scattering in their direction.

She blinked in shock as Silentwing’s paw <em>disappeared</em> into Laurelblaze’s body and pulled out a translucent form that resembled that of her deputy. 

<strong>” What are you doing!?”</strong> Icestar snarled, baring her canines menacingly. She met the ice-cold eyes of the joyous psychopath. Her own gaze was a torrential wave of blue-green flames. She felt murderous but she didn’t dare take a step closer. If that faint glow was what she suspected it to be, she was at the mercy of Silentwing’s will. 

<strong>” Murder her and I will have you begging to be killed!”</strong> The silvery-white leader spat out.

It was in an instant that she was no longer soaring through the air, instead, her physical form was just standing there, a stunned expression stuck on its face... But she was not in control. She couldn&#39;t move, both forms were unable to free themselves, Silentwing held her in her grip.

<em>Am I dead?</em>

No, if she had died, she would have woken up in StarClan, she was <em>outside</em> of her body. Her soul was partially suspended, drawn out by Silentwing, completely at her mercy. She stared down at the former WindClanner, her jaw parted as she stared through her partially translucent paws, and back to her actual body. <strong>&quot;Y-You!&quot;</strong> her voice had a reverb, a slight echo to it as she glanced around, unable to free herself. <strong>&quot;Release me! I don&#39;t need a body to kill you!&quot;</strong> she snarled aloud, swiping her paws at Silentwing, but they merely phased through her.

This was not her true form, because she was not actually dead, her soul did not contain the power of a StarClan cat that could defend itself, nor did it hold the power her physical body had. She couldn&#39;t fight back.

the cream and orange calico she-cat looked around, and she couldn&#39;t tell who was friend or foe, with the knowledge of her clanmates&#39; betrail she didn&#39;t know who to trust. she began attacking whoever came at her, even if it was possibly by accident, yowling with rage <em>Nectarglade don&#39;t do this! what if you end up hurting some innocent cat?!</em>. she threw this thought aside though, <em>i don&#39;t know who to trust! what if others have betrayed and are ready to attack me at any moment?!</em>.

the she-cat finally began diving into battle, blinded by rage <em>one day the camp is destroyed, then cats start becoming sick, now this??? what&#39;s next StarClan?!** felt claws tore at her pelt, and blood began to spatter on her coat, and she felt a searing pain running across her side. she looked through her one good eye, trying to decide who was good or bad, but alas she wasn&#39;t able to differentiate the crowd around her. she continued her attacking, pain striking her both physically and emotionally *these were cats i trusted with my life if i don&#39;t know who to trust why am i still here?</em>. that&#39;s then she was leapt upon, the breath was driven out of her, as she lay scrambling, but the cat&#39;s claws continued towards its target, leaving her more and more weary as it went on. she began blindly trying to attack but her paws never touched the cat. she was in a daze, weak from pain, she felt blood welling up from her wounds, and especially a large wound on her side and chest, she finally gave up, and she felt her body go limp, as she struggled to keep her eyes open. the cat lept from her and joined in the fray once more, but she remained there, unable to move, her body felt like it had fought a thousand battles, maybe tenfold that. the world became blurry soon, and she heard the sounds that had moments ago been so loud being drowned out, and though she fought to stay awake she feared that she wouldn&#39;t be awake much longer.

Silentwing&#39;s ear twitched in a gesture that indicated that she had no real interest in this whole event, when in reality, she was quite invested.  The pain and fear that she struck in the hearts of the cats around her was a nice appetizer for her final plan, and Icestar&#39;s own reaction was even better.  Laurelblaze certainly seemed as surprised and disturbed as all of the other felines who&#39;s eyes had been drawn to the scene, if not even more so.  The deputy even <em>stammered</em>- she never did that.  Silentwing knee that better than most, and the pleasure that Thunderclan&#39;s fear gave her made her want the moment to last forever.  Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t possible.  The cats would get bored of it eventually, maybe even moving against her, and she would have likely really lost interest by that time.  No, she had a mission that she was here to complete, and she wouldn&#39;t be leaving until what she started was over.  She worked too hard for this all to go to waste, and spending precious moments such as this to take in her own joy would only waste her to!e and give her enemies the opportunity to think.  They couldn&#39;t have that, now could they?  So, that meant that action had to be taken.. and it would be taken here and now, in the wrecked place the Thunderclanners called their home.  

               Silentwing paid mind to Laurelblaze&#39;s angry demands, but she didn&#39;t shown any indication of such.  She knew how much it hurt, feeling as if you weren&#39;t living but <em>watching</em> your own life go by.  Now that Laurelblaze was unable to do anything but stand dormant and take in what happened around her, Silentwing could save the bittersweet flavour of her pain, along with those around her.  Oh, what an amazing revenge the was turning out to be.</span>

             It was only when Laurelblaze attempted an attack on her that Silentwing sent a side glance to the deputy&#39;s soul, a smirk adorning her face and a spark of satisfied pleasure springing through her eyes in a way that could display nothing more than toxic excitement.  She turned her gaze back to Icestar as she spoke, her large smile failing to fade away.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Murder?&quot;</em></strong></em> She said, mock surprise expressing through her candy-dipped tone, <em><strong><em>&quot;Honey, you can&#39;t even *imagine</em> what I could do to her~ and trust me, you don&#39;t want to.&quot;*</strong></em> She said, her words leaving her mouth like starving cobras escaping a cage, eager for a bite of something moving.  Something living.  Sitting down, Silentwing showed she wasn&#39;t eager to do much other than talk, and she didn&#39;t expect anything else; from the other cats, of course.  She had a course of action that she was going to take, but theirs would be ruined.  She&#39;d make sure of it. 

                  <em><strong><em>&quot;I&#39;d hate for you to see such things happen to your beloved deputy.. you might just have to get another.  But we&#39;d hate for that to happen, wouldn&#39;t we?&quot;</em></strong></em> Silentwing asked, putting on a nonchalant demeanor as she examined her paw, the very paw who had Laurelblaze&#39;s soul trapped between it&#39;s claws.  <em><strong><em>&quot;We can avoid such... Unfortunate events, of course, you just have to.. *agree</em> to something, and your precious deputy can get her body back.&quot;*</strong></em> She offered, casting Icestar a side glance before turning her head, keeping Icestar&#39;s pale turquoise gaze on her own green-tinted ones.   The smile on her face widened as Silentwing licked her lips, readying herself for the proposition.</span>

The steady drums of war unforgotten and unhindered by loss. She rushes to Viperpaw’s side, examining her daughter for injuries. Aside from a few scratches and obviously injured pride, she’s unharmed; the senior warrior exhales the tension in her chest and passes a tongue between her kit’s ears.
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">“You need to be careful.

Icestar gritted her teeth. Silentwing was taunting her with that paw and her honey-sweet words. Immediately not killing Laurelblaze meant that the wretched villain wanted something from her and it didn’t take a genius to figure out what it was. To immobilize a Clan, you needed to get rid of its driving force and that happened to be the exact position she was in. It was a dirty move and Icestar only felt her anger rocketing up to the sky. 

There it was. The proposition was clear. Despite Laurelblaze’s soul partially hanging out from her body, the lynx-point didn’t fall into a crouch and beg to be sacrificed. She raised her chin and glared, analyzing the situation with great intensity. The main problem was that it involved trusting Silentwing to follow through with leaving Laurelblaze alone. She doubted that the snake would let her arch nemesis continue breathing while she wasn’t. However, did she have much of a choice? If she didn’t submit, Silentwing was going to rip away the dappled she’s soul in a heartbeat. 

Ideas played in her crafty mind until one in particular stood out. Icestar hadn’t made it this far with only her battle skills! 

A cold smirk played along her lips as she finally responded but the flames in her eyes were as dangerously sparking as ever. She wasn’t going to let Silentwing erode her self-confidence. If she was going down, she wanted it to be with spirit and grace. 

<strong>” Let’s do it but first, let her go.”</strong>

Never had she felt so powerless, absolutely at the mercy of another cat, not since she was but a small kit laying at her mother’s side- blind and deaf like all kits were born as. She couldn’t fight back, not unless her soul was returned to her body, and Silentwing was using her as yet another pawn.

<em>I slipped up.</em>

She could never have predicted that this was how Silentwing would go out, using her very soul as a bargaining chip in her games. Though, she figured she should have, those bodies they found on the northern border seemed so eerily empty, like their souls had been ripped from their forms. It <em>shouldn’t</em> be possible, but Silentwing always seemed to find ways to defy their expectations, to find a way to have the last laugh… And now Icestar was willing to lay down her life, <em>for her.</em>

The spectral form’s eyes widened, and she strained in Silentwing’s grasp in Icestar’s direction, desperately extending her paw out to her as if to emphasize what she was going to say next. <strong>”NO! I won’t allow you to do that for me!”</strong> she gasped, pain evident in her voice as she realized just what that would mean.

Her friend was willing to give up her life, in exchange for her own. Leaving ThunderClan in her paws.

<strong>”Icestar, I’ve told you I’d die for ThunderClan, I won’t let you sacrifice yourself for me. I can’t! Don’t do it!”</strong> but ultimately, she couldn’t stop her from doing it, she was still stuck in Silentwing’s grasp, unable to free herself. Yet the pain she was feeling deep down in her very being was immense, unbearable. <strong>”Don’t! DON’T!”</strong> she was pleading now, her voice straining as she was begging her leader not to sacrifice her life for her own.

<em>She didn’t want another cat to die for her sake, because of her actions.</em>

<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">Panic grips the stoic fae and she takes another staggering step forward - the battle slows to a halt around them. Laurelblaze is suspended above her fallen body; the scent of death is slowly creeping into the frozen fur and Hollyfrost feels bile rise up in her throat. She can’t stay like this for much longer, she realizes; there’s sure to be negative consequences to being torn from one’s body for too long.
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">Earlier, it had been far too clamorous to hear the dark ultimatum presented to ThunderClan’s matriarchs. Now, with Silentwing’s green eyes honed only on Icestar and the wicked grin that peels across her face, it becomes clear to the senior warrior: Icestar or Laurelblaze. Cold ice consumes Hollyfrost, rooting her to the spot. Laurelblaze is refuting the shadow warrior’s options but they fall on deaf ears.
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">It was either her mate or her best friend. Hollyfrost felt sick and the spinning grew worse. She swayed on her paws, falling forward and barely catching herself in the process. She wanted to reach out, grab Laurelblaze’s soul from Silentwing’s claws and put her back where she belonged. She couldn’t even <em>stand,</em> darkness too thick to see through and blood clouding the vision of one eye. 
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">“Icestar, please! There has to be another way - don’t. I can’t-” her voice is no more than a pained gasp, a feeble paw outstretched to the two cats who meant the most to her. She couldn’t lose them. She couldn’t lose either of them - a reality without Icestar or Laurelblaze in it was a world too painful to go on in.

A new voice met the ears of the devilish fem, but they were paid little attention to.  Silentwing merely cast the dark furred warrior ess a sideways glance, a look that was more of a glare than anything, as if she were watching a fly buzzing around her head.  But she wouldn&#39;t try and swat at any of the buzzing creatures in the camp until after she had finish what business she had came here for.  With a twitched of an ear, Silentwing&#39;s smile returned as she waited expectantly for Icestar to accept this offer; she was weak, and Silentwing knew that the point wouldn&#39;t let her Deputy die so easily, especially in such an unsettling manner.  It took longer than desired for the leader to respond, but Silentwing was a patient cat.  She had had to be patient for this whole plan, and she wasn&#39;t going to let it all slip away by trying to rush the process now.  A small frown <em>did</em> threaten to tug down the corners of her mouth, though, at Icestar&#39;s response, but it disappeared as fast at it had come.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Hmm..&quot;</em></strong></em> he hummed, debating the response.  Returning Laurelblaze&#39;s soul to her body would mean giving her the power to move again.  But, at the same time, Silentwing&#39;s goal was to end Thunderclan.  Without their leader, the clan wouldn&#39;t be able to run well enough to fight against her power, and Laurelblaze would be weaker than usual once being returned to normal.  It would be a momentary shock, but it could be enough time for Silentwing&#39;s plan to succeed.  Of course, she had expected an answer similar to this beforehand, but thinking over it one more time couldn&#39;t hurt... Especially if it meant raising suspense.</span>

               As she was about to speak, Silentwing cast Laurelblaze a sideways glance, her smile stronger than it has been for a long while.  Finally, she was going to have her success, and she would get back at the clan who had refused her and the cats who did it.  Returning her sights back to Icestar, Silentwing gave her the same powerful smile.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Alright, then.  We have a deal, as soon as you call off this makeshift army of yours,&quot;</em></strong></em> she purred, pausing a moment as she raised her paw.  She stood there until the cats around them stood down, staying still for a good moment before finally bringing her paw forward, sinking it into the chest fur of the deputy&#39;s body.  She felt as the power was drawn from her paws as soon as her claw touched the heart of the deputy, Laurelblaze&#39;s soul the water of a waterfall as it&#39;s strength was dragged back into her body.  As soon as the action was completed, Silentwing stepped towards Icestar, wasting no time.  <em><strong><em>&quot;It&#39;s time for the fun,&quot;</em></strong></em> she announced, smiling a wicked grin before leaping at the leader, aiming to take the first life to start the chain of stealing the rest away.

Laurelblaze’s protests flew past Icestar’s ears. She flicked them away with a tufted audit, dismissing them. She wasn’t going to go down so easily. Laurelblaze had to have more faith in her! Trusting Silentwing was unheard of. There were going to be no deals made here and Icestar was going to make sure that she was coming out victorious with Laurelblaze and the Clan in one piece. She was going to play this game on her own terms unbeknownst to the others. 

Hollyfrost’s cry was what disturbed her from her determined intent. Icestar froze, looking down at her best friend’s desperate words. The smirk upon her face warmed. <em>Trust me.</em> The silvery-white femme gave a wink, turning back to Silentwing with a spirited look. 

Her gaze darkened slightly at the next proposal set down but no protest arose. <strong>” ThunderClan! Halt!”</strong> The command came crystal clear.  

Icestar barely had enough time for another breath when Silentwing lunged right at her.

<strong>”No! STOP! Icestar, let me-!”</strong> her cry was cut off as Silentwing finally released her soul from her grip, leaving her to phase back into her dormant frame, returning to it’s rightful place. However, she did not wake up immediately, she was greeted by darkness, as if she were comatose, swimming in a sea of black and unable to find her way. She couldn’t hear, or feel a thing, numb to the rest of the world for mere moments as her body stood there, silent and still as a stone statue. Then, all of a sudden she could hear pounding, a rhythmic drumming of a heartbeat that was signifying her return to life— like the beat of war drums signifying the return of a hero from battle.

Except today, it was her song of warfare.

The deputy’s vision was foggy, phasing in and out as she was unable to make out her surroundings, struggling to move to see what was going on— unable to fight back, for now.

<strong>”N-No-“</strong> she coughed, her voice raspy as she tried to make herself move, but she stumbled, her balance had yet to return to her. She couldn’t fight back like this, and she had to will herself to move, to come back to life after being halfway-dead. <strong>”S-Stop-.”</strong> another coughing fit, her lungs felt like weights, stinging as she took a deep inhale, trying to catch her breath after being unable to move at all. As if she were petrified in place.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Bearmask—bloodied and battered from his continuous fighting of random NPCS—found Icestar, Laurelblaze, and Silentwing on the highledge when Silentwing had just taken hold of Laurelblaze’s soul. Had it not been for that, he would have singlehandedly ambushed the unsuspecting ghost. Unfortunately, he couldn’t risk preventing Laurelblaze’s soul from potentially returning to her body. He knew little of how this power of Silentwing’s worked, and he wasn’t about to go charging in recklessly to potentially cause the ThunderClan deputy’s death. Instead, he kept himself low to the ground, watching helplessly as events unfolded before him. Bearmask grit his teeth, anger pulsating throughout his entire body. This was the most annoying situation he could have ever possibly found himself in. All he needed was an opening . . .

His eyes widened when Silentwing proposed an exchange: Icestar’s lives for Laurelblaze’s one. Bearmask wanted nothing more than to tear out the spirit’s throat, wiping away that cocky grin of hers permanently. Hollyfrost’s plea momentarily caught his attention. Was Icestar really going to accept? Bearmask, and most likely Hollyfrost too, already knew what the answer was going to be. Blood roared in his ears as Icestar chose to accept, commanding everyone to cease their fighting.

His eyes swirled with unmistakable fury. There was no way he was going to let this happen. He had to do something.

No, he couldn’t. Bearmask saw the wink she gave Hollyfrost. Icestar had something planned. Whether it was a good plan or not (most likely not because Icestar was a big dumb head lmao XD) remained to be seen. He just had to trust the cat he’d grown so close to. For once, Bearmask had to do what he was told—although, of course, he’d never admit to it.</span>

The Thunderclan cats were ordered to stop their fighting, and those on Silentwing&#39;s side paused as well, leaving the grounds of the camp still, the only movement being the unfrozen figures of Silentwing, Icestar, and Laurelblaze, and perhaps a few loved one&#39;s, too.  But no action was going to be made, not while Silentwing was in action and an order from their own leader kept Thunderclan trapped in time.   Words were spoken; cried from the audience, pleads from Laurelblaze and the closest friends, and the loudest noise of all: Icestar&#39;s startled silence and Silentwing&#39;s silent battlecry as she leapt at the leader.  The dark, ever bloodied claws of the Dark forest cat&#39;s paws became outstretched, ready to strike as she flew through the air with as much grace as a hawk swooping at it&#39;s prey.  And, on the end, it would bring just as much satsifaction, but unlike a hawk finding a meal, one life wouldn&#39;t feed her hunger.  She needed more than just one death at her claws.  Unlike other cats, she had lost her morals moons ago, and now she was never shameful when she added more blood to her claws.  No, instead, it gave her even more excitement.  Excitement she had come to crave.</span>

                She fed this hunger, if even the smallest bit, as she felt her claws slash through fur.  Deep.  Crimson spewed onto her fur as she landed once more, she turned around to take in the scene.  Her claws had sliced through the fiery leader&#39;s neck, slitting Icestar&#39;s throat in a smooth, masterfully complete movement. She watched the point fall like a starving animal, a crazed look in her eyes as her heart raced.  One life down, but there were more to go.  Her sickeningly-sweet words were absent now, Silentwing&#39;s attention no longer being spent on speaking.  She was too focused on the task she had given herself; a task she would complete.  She stood there, waiting, as Icestar&#39;s life drained out of her.  She would stand there patiently, awaiting for the leader&#39;s next life to bring her to her feet.  And once it had, she sprung into action once more, moving and aiming In a new way and direction.  She would do this for as long as she needed, and watch as Icestar&#39;s rein neared it&#39;s end.  Her rein, and Thunderclan&#39;s glory.

Nectarglade continued to lay there, she tried to say something like <em>&#39;please help me&#39;</em> or something but no words escaped her mouth. The she-cat fought for breath, as though some imaginary foe still continued to be driving the air from her lungs. Her vision grew blurrier, and she found herself fighting against her eyelids for fear that if they shut they would never re-open. <em>StarClan help me</em> she pleaded.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Most of the fighting had ceased even before Icestar&#39;s call to halt. Loyalists, traitors, and Dark Forest cats alike looked to the sight before them. Dustycloud could feel his consciousness ebbing away with blood loss as he watched the shiny ghost of his adoptive mother placed back into her body. Confusion and panic clouded his mind and his judgement, ears filled with SIlentwings demand and Icestars resign and Hollyfrosts horrific scream. He&#39;d give up his ears to never hear such a sound from her mouth ever again.
It wasnt until the leader of the attack dove for the pale fur along Icestars chest, staining it with thick red liquid that a tear freed itself from his eyes. He whirled on the nearest Dark Forest, <strong>&quot;Make her stop!&quot;</strong> He cried, to which the dead feline only smirked and laughed at him. Dustycloud felt utterly powerless, scared of leaving the vulnerable group of queens, kits and elders but terrified of losing a single cat down there. He was caught between innocent lives and there was no ethical or moral choice to behold. He casted a watery gaze to his clanmates cornered in the den, seeing Nectarglade just a few tail lengths away from the bottom of the High ledge. He managed to shove his hindlegs beneath him and stumble down the slope, sitting down the moment he was able. Brown paws trembled as they became stained a dark red and black color, pushing against the wound that seemed to be the worst in an effort to stop the bleeding. <strong>&quot;I-Its okay. Its gonna- Its gonna be okay. Youll be fine.&quot;</strong> His voice trembled, careful not have salty tears drip into the she-cats open wounds. <strong>&quot;K-Keep your eyes open if you can. Just stay with me, okay- please st-stay with me.&quot;</strong> He whimpered, having seen far too much death that day already. He looked from Nectarglade, to the top of the High Ledge, to Silentwings consistent beating against Icestars body.
Dustycloud knew he would never get these nightmares to leave him. <span class="mention" title="Fawnleap//Toffmel#5591">@Fawn</span></span>

Nectarglade continued to struggle, feeling what little strength she still possessed leaving her. She felt a cat move up beside her and could vaguely make out a cat who she thought to be Dustycloud. She heard his trembling voice and found comfort knowing that she wasn&#39;t alone. She widened her eyes as to say <em>&#39; please don&#39;t leave me alone, I don&#39;t wanna die! if I do, I don&#39;t wanna be alone! &#39;</em> but she couldn&#39;t tell if the tom understood. She continued to put an effort into staying awake, begging with all of her might to StarClan and whoever else might be out there listening to her silent prayers to allow her to live, <em>I can&#39;t die, please don&#39;t let me</em>, she hoped there was more for her in this world, and she knew that if she were to go down in the flames, she wouldn&#39;t go down without a fight.

Instinct told her to defend herself. To throw up a paw and swipe away Silentwing’s attack. But she couldn’t. She had to remain rooted to the ground as Silentwing easily delivered the first killing blow. Agony burst out from her throat. A single slice was all it took for the lynx-point to crumble to the cold stone floor. Laying there in a weak crouch, Icestar slowly drowned in her own thick blood. Each pulse widened the crimson puddle around her. Her first life ended with a defiant glare towards Silentwing. 

It wasn’t over. As soon as her first breath seeped into her still lungs, starting her bodily systems once more, Silentwing made sure that there wasn’t much time to recover. Pain came from every angle. Frustration sizzled every nerve but Icestar had to force her body to remain still and receive the onslaught of deaths. The most she could muster was to show Silentwing she didn’t fear her. Sea-green optics remained as furious as ever, a forest of blazing hell to any who met the pair. 

Then it all ended. Weakened by losing so many lives at once, Icestar could only lay there, breaths heavy with exhaustion. <em>I have to get up!</em> She wasn’t going to let Silentwing take her soul in this vulnerable state. For the sake of her pride and Laurelblaze who still remained dazed on the sidelines. For the sake of her Clan who were watching down below.

<strong>” You’re not going to win,”</strong> the lynx-point growled out, staggering up to her paws. <strong>” Taking my soul will not result in the consequences you wish.”</strong> It was going to strengthen ThunderClan even more but Silentwing was too blind to realize. All she could see in front of her was a dream of victory. A dream that was as far away as the Sun Drown Place. Raising her head in its confident stance, she glared at the manic she-cat with challenge. 

<strong>” Do it. I dare you!”</strong> Icestar snarled.

He didn’t even let out a cry, only stood in place, shaking with an almost uncontrollable rage. His claws raked the floor beneath him, aching to strike at the dead WindClan warrior. Were their kits watching this? The thought had slipped his mind, and faded just as quickly as he saw Icestar bleed to death upon the highledge. Bearmask couldn’t think of anything other than what was happening above him.

What would Wolfcry do? Could he have stopped this? Was he watching too? Watching as Bearmask stood unable to save another leader?

There was no time for sulking. He needed to be ready. He tried to calm his nerves, slowing his breathing, trying to think more rationally. There would be a moment to act. There always was. There had to be. There had to be.

He would crush her.</span>

Blood and gore filled her sight, the fact that none of it was her own only making the moment sweeter.  She could taste the iron on her tounge, a taste that refused to go away.  But she didn&#39;t mind, no, if anything, she wanted it to stay for the whole day.  It would only remind her of her coming success and the goal she was running towards so successful.  By now, she was having more fun mauling Icestar rather than reaching her desires.  Claws slashed through fur, teeth through flesh, as she continued to spring at Icestar from so many different directions that not even she could count them.  Despite the continual killing blows that Silentwing landed, Icestar always came back, restored with the power of Starclan behind her eyes, a deadly glare showing through the green-blue optics.  But, no matter what some might say, looks couldn&#39;t kill, and it only made her smile wider.  Her face must have looked like that of the Cheshire cat&#39;s at this point.  Silenrwing was thrilled as she landed blows as deadly as the one that Doeleap had used to end Beetlestreak&#39;s life in the dark forest.  Except this time, Silentwing did the deed, and she got to so again and again, killing away Icestar&#39;s lives like moths in a flame.  Until, finally, she came to a stop.</span>

                Claws of darkness dug into the ground of Thunderclan&#39;s camp as Silentwing came to an adrupt stop, halting herself just before she could spring again.  Icestar&#39;s voice caught her attention, and Silentwing turned, a spark of cruel, crazy joy springing through her gaze as she took a step towards the leader, bringing the solo massacre to a pause.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, don&#39;t you have faith?&quot;</em></strong></em> He purred, her voice like venom as each word was carefully formed on her tongue.  <em><strong><em>&quot;But, you see, faith doesn&#39;t get you far.  The lack of it is exactly why I&#39;m here- making my name known.  You&#39;re death will be the start to this plan if mine, and you can be sure that, once your gone, I&#39;ll finish what you and this band of misfits you call a clan have started, sweetheart.&quot;</em></strong></em> she promised, her voice a killing lullaby.  She slowely walked closer to Icestar, until one more pawstep would have made the two collide.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Dare, you say?  Well, if you dare~&quot;</em></strong></em> she started, although she never finished the statement.  Raising a paw, she thrust her paw forward, doing so in a movement that would have, in most cases, caused her claws to run into flesh and fur.  But not for this cat, and not on this day.  No, instead, they entered the world of muscle and organs, stopping only when her claws could grip a specific power inside the leader&#39;s chest; her heart, beating with the strength of the strongest warrior.  But Silentwing didn&#39;t leave this strength to thrive in Icestar&#39;s chest, nor did she tease it.  Instead, she closed her claws around it with power, before tugging with the power of a mammoth.  When Icestar&#39;s soul had left her body in the same manner as Laurelblaze&#39;s, Silentwing didn&#39;t stop.  She hardly even paused.</span>

               With the strong pull of her paw, Silentwing tugged the entire being of Icestar&#39;s soul out of her body, leaving the mortal frame to collapse, surrounded by the horror of the cats who had gathered around.  And, the whole while, her smile stayed plastered on her face.  Opening her paw, she let the soul go, watching as it evaporated like mist into the wind, leaving Icestar&#39;s body and the blood-soaked ground in it&#39;s wake.

She was weak.

Her vision was slowly returning to her, blurry and phasing in and out as she unsteadily returned to the land of the living, having been half-dead left her weakened momentarily. Her frame swayed to and fro as she tried to make out the scene in front of her, slowly regaining her senses as she witnessed the former WindClanner exact her vengeance against ThunderClan’s leadership. <strong>”N-No.”</strong> she rasped out, her voice straining as she was regaining her breath, taking a shaky step forward as she slowly was approaching Silentwing. Rage was bubbling deep within her chest, her fury causing her heartbeats to quicken in pace and send surges of adrenaline and anger of the purest form coursing through her veins. She could see clearly now, she could hear, the scent of metallic blood was reaching her nose, all belonging to her friend. The one who laid her life down for her. She couldn’t stop Silentwing from slicing open Icestar’s neck every single time, until she was left with a single life, before she ripped out her very soul. All she could do was watch helplessly as she grew stronger and stronger as her life force began to race through her veins once again, no longer feeling the cold hand of death creeping up on her form. 

And Silentwing thought she would just stand there and allow it to happen without justice?

<strong>”You… You snakehearted coward!”</strong>

The ThunderClan deputy stood up taller now, her long fangs bared in a vicious snarl as her fur bristled wildly. Her gaze was blazing, almost as if she wanted to set an inferno upon Silentwing with one look alone. Her claws had fully extended, digging into the stone ledge below, ready for when she finally ended the mere existence of this she-cat. 

<strong>”You’ll die for that! I’ll rip you limb from limb!”</strong>

And with that, the final battle had truly begun, and only one of them would emerge victorious. She launched herself forward, preparing an all-out assault that she prayed would leave nothing left of the spectral feline she was targeting.

<em>Faith?</em> Perhaps faith had partially to do with it but to depend solely on faith was not an act Icestar would depend on. She was a feline who lingered within the realms of logic and for Silentwing to underestimate ThunderClan’s leader to such an extent only solidified her upcoming loss. 

A gasp dragged out from her lungs as Silentwing plunged a paw right into her chest. If she could’ve, Icestar would’ve staggered back from the force but it seemed as if her body was slow to respond to her will. Before she could no longer control her vessel, Icestar raised her head one last time. The devilish grin on her features was no mistake: Silentwing had fallen right into the lynx-point’s trap. 

<strong>&quot; You&#39;re done for.&quot;</strong>

Silentwing made it quick. The light winked out of her eyes the moment her whole soul slipped out. There was no time for her ghost to even blink before the tortoiseshell finished her off effectively. Her silvery-white body slumped unmoving to the ground. Icestar was no more.

Icestar&#39;s final expression was one that Silentwind didn&#39;t expect; a <em>grin</em>.  Silentwing&#39;s facial muscles threatened to put a frown on her face, but she kept the impulse back.  Instead, her smile became a shin expression of contemplation as her eyes searched Icestar&#39;s face for any reason as to why she was smiling in her last moments.  Silentwing could steal the souls of other cats, taking them from their bodies and ending their existence.  But why, when she could do that, couldn&#39;t she read the minds of the very souls she captured?  The doubt staying in her mind for a moment more, before she brushed it away as nothing.  She had allowed Icestar&#39;s act get to her, even if just the littlest bit.  Pitiful.  Silentwing stepped back as she watched the point fall to the ground, signing the end of Icestar&#39;s rein and the beginning of a new era.  One that Silentwing would get rid of just as quickly as she had gotten rid of this one.</span>

              Turning around swiftly, Silentwing faced the cat who was now screaming at her, promising her a painful death.  Silentwing&#39;s smile returned in full as she watched Laurelblaze&#39;s rage.  Anger was such a foolish, clumsy thing; something that could easily be messed with for your own better outcome.  Despite the fact that all of Silentwing&#39;s actions were fueled on anger and the ruins of her past life, she thought lowly for others for letting it show on their face.  Why would a cat yell a battle cry as they kill their opponent, instead of giving them one last look at your cruel smile?  And that was exactly what was on Silentwing&#39;s face now: a smile of sour milk.  Well, it seemed that Laurelblaze had regained her previous strength... or at least, most of it.  It wouldn&#39;t change her future, though, nor would it change the outcome of the situation.  Looking the large, enraged fem in the eye, Silentwing waited for her one-friend to make her move.  Let the deputy try, and she&#39;ll see what would happen.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Go ahead and try it, feel free.&quot;</em></strong></em> Silentwing offered, a wicked gleam in her eye as Laurelblaze lunged at her.  

               At the last moment when Laurelblaze was inches away, Silentwing slipped out from under her grasp, using the hard stone of the high ledge to aim herself, and eventually using it to jump off of.  With a tall leap, Silentwing sent her paw down and sent her claws across Laurelblaze&#39;s hind quarters, finding ground soon afterwards and preparing to strike again, looking for the perfect opening to finish this off once and for all.  One Laurelblaze was gone and had joined Icestar wherever she had gone, the clan would be vulnerable, and they would have no chance against her power.  Thunderclan would be no more.</span>

To think that this was the future she had with Silentwing, viciously tearing one another apart after many moons of friendship— all deciding the fate of her beloved ThunderClan. Icestar was bleeding out on the Highledge, her soul ripped from her body, all because she wanted to save <em>her</em>. After her fate became intertwined with Silentwing’s, one that was a dangerous bond that led to so much death and destruction. But how could one predict a friendship turning into turmoil? Though she realized maybe she was foolish enough to believe she could redeem someone by herself, maybe she wasn’t able to save everyone.

And this was heartbreaking for her.

Her friend, corrupted by her path of bloodshed and vengeance, led her to her early demise, and today it was no different. She tried to turn her clan against her, all because Laurelblaze abandoned her, when she knew all was lost, when Silentwing did not wish for redemption. All because she chose her clan instead, as a deputy should. Yet it hadn’t made her decision any easier, she still wondered if she had held out for a little while longer, maybe she could have saved her.

Maybe she could have saved everyone who was cut down by her. Maybe they would have lived.

Mercy was not an option today, for the crime of striking down a clan leader in cold blood most certainly warranted a capital punishment. An eye for an eye, a just death to bring justice to the cat she had killed. Laurelblaze had to strike her former friend down, there was no ifs about it, she couldn’t keep perpetuating this cycle of violence between them, her clan was to not suffer at her claws ever again. The deputy hissed as she felt ghostly claws rake themselves across her flank, sending blood spattering against the Highledge. Yet in her raging state, the deputy was not deterred from pursuing her target, channeling her emotions into her attacks as she savagely swung her paws at her opponent’s head and sides— trying to knock her to the ground.

This was a battle of epic proportions, and for the sake of avenging everyone she had lost, it was time they ended this charade.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">After watching his closest companion be continuously mauled to death a few more times, he came to realize what Icestar’s plan was. She had told him about it moons ago, but he refused to believe her. A second soul. Unless Silentwing could detect the presence of another soul within a cat, there was no way for her to actually know about it. Laurelblaze would undoubtedly try to avenge their leader, and it would be then that Bearmask would find his opening.

Still, waiting wasn’t really his specialty, especially not when the cat he cared most about was dying in front of him multiple times.

Bearmask forced his body to comply, however, knowing Icestar’s sacrifice would mean nothing if he were to mess it up now. So he waited. Waited until Icestar had finally lost her last life. He could feel his heart beating in his throat and ears, the tune of a mellowed rage ringing softly inside him, waiting to burst into flames. Flames that Bearmask had learned to control over the past moons. Flames that allowed him to continue pursuing his goal of becoming the greatest warrior of all time, despite every opposition.

<em>Just a little longer,</em> he told himself, watching as Laurelblaze eventually stood to face off against Silentwing once more. She’d clearly been weakened from having her entire soul ripped out.

<em>Almost…</em>

Silentwing struck out at Laurelblaze, raking her claws against the deputy’s hind quarters…

And leaving her back vulnerable to him.

Now!

Bearmask felt his entire body react instinctively as he jumped up the highledge in less than a heartbeat, pummeling into Silentwing’s side with his head using all of his might, trying to knock the wind out of her—if that was even possible for a ghost.

<strong>”Corpses should stay in the ground!”</strong> Bearmask growled, eyes lit up with rage. And yet, it still seemed like he was fully in control of himself. Because he always was. <em>I’ll help kill this scum and save my Clan!</em>

The power of fear behind them would have sent chills down his spine if he still had the strength to tense his exhausted muscles anymore. <strong>&quot;Youre okay, youre okay.&quot;</strong> He sniffed, continuing to apply pressure to the wounds. Blood coated just about every corner of his brown pelt, but every time his vision felt like it was growing too dark, or his head felt too heavy, he remembered exactly what was at stake and he managed to pull himself back to reality.
The pale tabby fur below him was darkening, relinquishing its gold touches for a far grimmer shade of red. <em>Medicine cat. I need a medicine cat.</em> He kept thinking but if he stopped applying the pressure to go searching there was every chance she might just not make it. Then he&#39;d have killed two cats that night.
He had stopped looking at the battle for the sake of his own mental state. Every single life was viciously battered out of their leader and all he did was turn his back to it, wishing nothing more than to claw his ears off. He had stopped shaking only because of his weakened state but the tears still fell freely down his cheeks and onto his chest fur, stinging the wounds below.
It wasnt until noises from the crowd made him suspect something truly awful happen that he turned just in time to see Icestar wink out of existence entirely. Just like that. Was he hallucinating all of this? Surely that was impossible, or at least it was <em>supposed</em> to be. Wails and whimpers from his clanmates were heard around him as Laurelblaze seemed to regain herself. He was more than ashamed of the way he almost yelled at her to stay on the ground, whimpering as Silentwing found a new target in his adoptive mother once more. He was somewhat relieved to see her gain some help from a clanmate and soon enough the brawl became a sight he just couldnt look away from. <span class="mention" title="Fawnleap//Toffmel#5591">@Fawn</span></span>

Silentwing was finally having her last face-off with Laurelblaze, and she knew that she would win.  She had already jumped into it head-first, no hesitation slowing her movements as she made the move of offense, decorating Lauerlblaze&#39;s haunches in crimson, watching the occasional drop of blood splatter on the stone like rain, her grin ever present.  She didn&#39;t even seem to be concentrating much at all.  Why would she, when her future and Thunderclan&#39;s was set in stone?  She had made it so that her name would forever be known, and the clan who had refused to help her would be gone, too, even if it included a cat who she had once considered a good friend.  

A cat who had killed her, bringing her here.  

           Silentwing wasn&#39;t shameful at the fact that she was attacking a cat who she had once been so close to, a cat who had wanted to help her so bad.  No, she wanted vengeance, and she wouldn&#39;t stop until she got it.  Not in the last life, not in this one.  And although she wanted Thunderclan out of the picture, she had decided she would give them a ending to remember.  Or, at least, a battle to remember as one that Silentwing had planned and won.  She would finally have her name known, instead of <em>her&#39;s.</em>  Instead of Laurelblaze&#39;s and Icestar&#39;s, Shiversight&#39;s and any of his family members, <em>she</em> would be remembered.  Her legacy would continue, and theirs would end... even if the Shiny family failed to be present to enjoy it.  She had been killed in her past life by the bulking tortoiseshell, and in this one, she would return the favor.</span>

           But despite Silentwing&#39;s attempts at staying patient and cool-headed, she found the same state of mind absent in this moment.  She wanted this to be done, to be over with, so, at long last, she could finally end this.  End Thunderclan.  It was inches away from her paws, so close that she could already feel the glory.  And this made her irrational and stupid.  She had leapt at the deputy without keeping the cats around her in mind; the ones who had orders to stay in place from a dead cat.  Just as Silentwing thought she could catch the perfect chance to take Laurelblaze&#39;s soul and have her join Icestar, she was pushed to the side by a cat she hadn&#39;t paid mind to notice beforehand.  A loud hiss exited her throat and her smile finally disappeared, turning into a deep scowl just before her side hit the ground.  As soon as it did, her breath had indeed been stolen from her.  She felt it leaving her lungs in one large heap, keeping her on the ground for a few moments more as she tried to get it back.  Once she had, she prepared to push this enraged tom off of her and finish him off, too.  But she was moments too late.

Nectarglade let out a weak groan as the tom beside her began pressing on the wounds, but she was grateful for what he was trying to do. All the while she was praying, <em>begging</em> for her own safety, and life, and still attempting to keep her eyes open, a battle that she feared she might be losing. She saw the battle still raging about her, even if the boil of it had gone down to a simmer. She saw her fallen clanmates around and wished she could help them, but her body wouldn&#39;t move, it took an effort just to get one breath out. <em>oh StarClan, please save us all, don&#39;t let this destroy us</em>

Her wounds ached, and she could feel skinny trails of blood dripping from them and onto the forest floor. While she had survived worse, these wounds were etched in by a cat who went in with the intent on killing her. She never wished for this turn of events to happen, she never wanted to be the one to strike down her friend more than once.

But this had to end, she had to put her to rest.

<em>StarClan forgive me for everything I have done, and everyone I allowed to be brought down before her claws.</em>

Bearmask had come in to help her, to prevent her soul from being stolen yet again... To prevent her from meeting the same fate as Icestar. She wiped away blood from a wound on her cheek, panting heavily as she approached Silentwing, picking her head up with one of her claws. Yet instead of a furious expression adorning her features, her eyes had begun to water, grief being struck within her as she had come to terms with what she must do in that moment. 

<strong>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Silent.&quot;</strong>

A quick slash across her throat, and it was over. She let the other she-cat drop to the ground, leaving her to disappear from this world for good, never to return to the Dark Forest, or the mortal plane. She was... <em>gone</em>.

And Laurelblaze did not know how she should have felt in this moment.

A shaky breath escaped her maw as she tried to stifle a choked up sob, for she felt as if she had failed Silentwing, she <em>never</em> wanted to resort to this. She never wanted to kill her, she never wanted to kill anyone... The other tortoiseshell had left her no other choice.

<em>Maybe... Maybe in another life, maybe I can save another.</em>

<em>But who am I kidding?</em>

The deputy approached the edge of the Highledge, looking down at her clanmates below, exhaustion darkening her gaze as she belted out a loud cry.

The battle was over.

They were victorious.

<em>But at what cost?</em>

<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">Hollyfrost feels her legs turn to jelly, wobbling at the knees the second Laurelblaze limps to the edge of High Ledge. The world turns on its side; she’s gone before her head hits the ground.
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">She briefly feels heat pooling around her ears and the muffled sounds of those around her calling hers and Icestar’s names. Green eyes, distant and unfocused, glance around as blurry shapes crowd around her. Familiar scents dull and fade; the roar of blood in her ears slows to a dull thud, drowning out those around her, and her eyes finally roll back into her skull as it slows to a stop.
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">She’s floating by her still body moments later. Laurelblaze is there; Viperpaw, Dustycloud, Foxpaw, Tigerpaw - her kits and mate are shaking her, watching as her chest rises and falls, rises and falls, rises . . . falls. Stillness. Silence. 
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">Their cries are hollow, echoes from across a deep cavern. Holly feels her heart clench in her chest - she leans forward to comfort them, to wrap her tail around them, to wipe their tears as they fall so freely down strong cheeks; she passes through them, a mere phantom with intangibility and longing boring a hole through her chest. 
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content"><em>”No, please. Let me say goodbye,”</em> she pleads to nobody, glancing around camp. A silvery steam rises from Icestar’s body as the leader’s body grows colder. A wail rises in the senior warrior’s throat. She leaves her mate’s side and crouches beside Icestar’s glassy-eyed form. She presses her nose into her friend’s fur, holding on to her lingering scent. 
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">The sounds begin to get clearer and her soul grows more and more opaque. She can tell her body grows colder, allowing her to materalize more fully; it’s like a breath of fresh air.

</div></div>&gt;

<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">“Who dies this way? How pathetic!” She spits, angry at herself. Growing old - it had slowed her down, left her vulnerable enough for that rotten Deerbounce to get the better of her. Claws sink into the dirt, leaving no trail behind of her ghostly grip. 
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">“Fine, I’ll come. But only so I can beat her sorry hide until she’s nothing more than dew under my paws.”

<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">It had been quite a journey, getting here, she realizes as she allows Laurelpaw to begin leading her away from the hollow. Away from her family, her friends, her Clanmates. Cats responsible for raising her, cats she swore she’d protect. Atop the cliff wall - now an easy climb without physical muscles to strain - Holly pauses, looking back.

They’d never have the life she had when she was their age - one more parent still remained, and a loving one at that. She could leave them in peace, knowing they would be cared for in her absence.
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">Dustycloud, the little kit she protected from nightmares during her nightwatches. How he’d grown, a tom covered with scars and bruises from defending his home. Pride swelled in her for her son, hoping he knew just how much she believed in him. Sweet and tender, but capable all on his own.
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">Foxpaw . . . her kind and gentle boy. He was softspoken but one day he’d carry his Clanmates with strength and serenity.

<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">Tigerpaw . . . <em>&#39;don’t let this bitter you,’</em> she prays, hoping her fiery kit wouldn’t hold this too close to her sensitive heart. She would be okay - perhaps pour herself into her training to prevent something like this from ever happening again - but with Laurelblaze at her side, Hollyfrost knew her daughter would only grow stronger from this. 
</div></div>&gt; 
<div class="quote"><div class="quote-border"></div><div class="quote-content">Viperpaw, ever the fighter. Holly sighs; the death of a parent, especially one who was defending her, would leave deep scars in the apprentice’s malleable mind. <em>’Take care of your siblings.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Bearmask watched unblinking as Laurelblaze finished Silentwing off until eventually there was nothing left of the ghostly figure. As Laurelblaze cried out a bittersweet victory, Bearmask looked over at Icestar’s unmoving body. <strong>”Hey,”</strong> he said, padding over to the she-cat’s. <strong>”Hey,”</strong> he repeated once more, nudging her body with his head. <strong>”It’s over. We won.”</strong> Bearmask’s voice quivered as he spoke. Blood ran down the side of his head and flank, dripping onto the highledge.

Bearmask waited for a response of any kind, but nothing showed. Could he have been wrong? For a moment, he felt anger begin to rise in his chest again, but also a deep sadness. He lowered his head as his eyes began to water. There was silence for a moment, but eventually he spoke again.

<strong>”I’m sorry.”</strong>

Bearmask lowered himself to the ground, burrying his nose into Icestar’s flank, trying his best not to cry. <strong>”I’m sorry.”</strong> For the first time in his life, laying there upon the highledge, he felt more vulnerable than he ever allowed himself to be. And he was okay with it.

The battle had come to an end, but many cats were bloodied and wounded severely, yet one cat in particular had stood out to Laurelblaze upon the Highledge. When she saw a familiar figure of dark fur collapse to the ground. Her eyes widened as she nearly darted off the edge of the Highledge right then and there, but that would have certainly spelled death for her immediately. Instead, she stumbled over her paws as she made a dash for the stones leading down from the Highledge, practically leaping off of the last step and into the clearing. The deputy pushed aside other figures of her clanmates as she rushed to her mate&#39;s side.

<em>Nononononono, not now, not NOW!</em>

The russet-toned tortoiseshell approached her mate&#39;s still form with uncertainty, her eyes widened in fear for the worst, gently placing one of her paws against her side for <em>any</em> sign of breathing. It&#39;s shallow at first, but moments later, a final breath is drawn, and she begins to shake. <strong>&quot;Holly, you can&#39;t. Wake up!&quot;</strong> <em>Don&#39;t leave me.</em> <strong>&quot;Hollyfrost, please!&quot;</strong> <em>Not like everyone else.</em> <strong>&quot;Don&#39;t die on me!&quot;</strong> <em>I can&#39;t lose you too.</em>

But her cries fell upon deaf ears, for Hollyfrost had joined their ancestors in Silverpelt already. It was too late.

Her desperate cries were muffled in dark ebony fur, nose buried in what was once a source of warmth, of comfort from the cold. Now, it was being drained of life, no longer Hollyfrost, but an empty shell of what once was.

<em>I can&#39;t even say goodbye, I can&#39;t even tell her I love her, I never said it enough to her.</em>

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">{Viperpaw}</div>
The little fighter according to her mother had been watching helplessly as one had nearly lost her life to some deranged spirit, while the other had collapsed to the ground. She was frozen, shaking in her paws as she let out a loud wail, unable to move. She didn&#39;t want to accept it, her mother couldn&#39;t be dead, she <em>couldn&#39;t</em>.

The black tortoiseshell forced herself to muster the willpower to move forward, to see Hollyfrost&#39;s body for herself, to force herself to accept the reality, no matter how cruel it was. Her mother had died <em>protecting her</em>.

And for once in her life, she finally cried, never once had she spilled tears, for she saw them as weakness. They were a non-stop flood, dripping down off of her cheeks as choked up sobs escaped her lips as she buried her nose into her brother, Foxpaw&#39;s fur, unable to contain her grief.

<em>I let this happen, I couldn&#39;t escape from Deerbounce.</em>

<em>This should have been me.</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Weakly, the brown tom had finally managed to scrounge up some moss from a nearby nest that had been yanked from a den and shredded to a million different pieces. He tried not to think about the story behind the scene and just focused on using the moss to bind the mollys wounds. He had seen the medicine cats do it before plenty of times and he could only pray it was half as good as their doings. He reasoned that just about anything would be better than his paws at this rate. Besides, he was beginning to think he couldnt will himself out of losing consciousness and he didnt want to leave Nectarglade with nothing.
As Dustycloud turned his gaze back, he watched breathlessly as the throat of the phantom was slashed and Laurelblazes movements stilled. As she climbed High Ledge he couldnt help but feel nothing but ominous shadows loom overhead. A battle cry, broken and hollow, but loud and demanding to be heard all the same. Why didnt he feel the relief? Why didnt he feel safe? Why did he have the terrifying sense that he had forgotten something? <em>Or someone...</em> <strong>&quot;Hollyfrost!&quot;</strong>
The black warrior collapsed onto the ground and the awful whimpers of a son desperately reaching his dying mother filled the space in between. He staggered and bled all the way there, collapsing at her flank. <strong>&quot;Hey-Hey can you hear me? H-Hollyfrost? W-We did it, Holly. You did it please- please d-dont go. Cmon-&quot;</strong> He dug his paws into her flank so much like he had on the many nights she had quelled his nightmares. Perhaps if he did bleed out here it wouldnt be so bad. At least he wouldnt be lonely, now surrounded by Laurelblaze and his younger siblings he wished were more than just strangers, and now he&#39;d finally have someone to look forward to on the other side.
Maybe it wouldnt so bad if the world turned black, if only it meant a heartbeats worth of rest... <span class="mention" title="Fawnleap//Toffmel#5591">@Fawn</span> <span class="mention" title="✧*̥˚ snips *̥˚✧#1759">@fuzz</span> <span class="mention" title="AIMSIR#9490">@cobra</span> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

Dark clouds hung over the sky, little light able to penetrate through. Dark and gloomy, it seemed as if the sky itself was attempting to hold back various emotions. Perhaps rage, sorrow. Among many others. One couldn&#39;t keep track of everything, not with so much bloodshed happening about them. Blue eyes had shone wide as terror raged about rampant, the cries of those fallen - both friend and foe still rang in his ears, leaving a horrible feeling in his own soul. Trusted allies had turned against them, with the aid of some demonic force alongside them, one couldn&#39;t even begin to believe what had happened without seeing it. But it meant nothing.
    Well, perhaps it did. But one hardly noticed it if their focus was somewhere else. When everything else falls away and fades into a muffled sound, residing in the background - hardly aware that such even exists. When a horrorsome event played out right in front of one&#39;s very gaze, it did something to them. Traumatized...such would be an understatement. The stench of blood, death and fear...so overwhelmingly powerful, it made the tabby&#39;s head throb. And yet, he refused to turn away. He could not even begin to turn away.
    First it had been Laurelblaze, his mother. Her very soul being ripped from her had struck him with absolute fear. Blue eyes had begged to close, to turn away but he couldn&#39;t bear to do it...if something happened to her... It wasn&#39;t like he could stop it anyway, but what made matters worse was that his mentor was among the fray. She defiantly stood against the enemy. And yet, she&#39;d allowed the opposing force to take her lives. Every single one. Blood had been spilt, but this time it was different. That blood was different. His mentor&#39;s blood. Spilled for the final time as her soul vanished...and only her body remained.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">He&#39;d felt like wailing. Maybe he already had been. Maybe he&#39;d begun to sob, but now another event was about to take place. <em>NO! NOT HER TOO!</em> He&#39;d shrieked silently, as Laurelblaze now battled it out with Icestar&#39;s murderer. Already she&#39;d almost died and now, she&#39;d be fighting for her life again. Horrorstruck, the tom could hardly bear to watch, feeling as if it&#39;d only be a moment before his own heart stopped. Through a blurry gaze, the tabby had watched and pleaded. <em>Don&#39;t let her die. Please...</em>
    And somehow, she hadn&#39;t. With the aid of Bearmask, his mother was able to defeat the one who&#39;d brought destruction upon Thunderclan. And at last, it was finished. At this moment, he could hardly breathe. He merely stared, a mix of emotions flowing about within him, ranging from relief to grief. Shakily, he rose and carrying his limp leg, began hobbling toward those who&#39;d saved Thunderclan. Only to be met with a horrible sight.

He almost missed it, but a dark form laid off to one side of the camp. He remembered briefly seeing the form earlier, but it wasn&#39;t until now that he realized who it was. He&#39;d stood there frozen, as various others approached the still form. Slowly, he limped his way over, tears threatening to spill over. He shook a bit, suddenly weak. He collapsed beside the dark feline&#39;s body, laying a paw gently upon her shoulder. <strong>&quot;Hollyfrost...please. Don&#39;t die...don&#39;t leave us. We won...don&#39;t go Hollyfrost. We can&#39;t lose you too.&quot;</strong> When there was no reply, the tears began to flow. <strong>&quot;Mom...she didn&#39;t- she&#39;s-.&quot;</strong>1 He couldn&#39;t manage any more. He could only mourn alongside the others.

<em>A Flashback in Time</em>

<em>What should I do?</em> This one question reverberated in her mind whilst staring into Silentwing’s cruel eyes. Giving up her soul seemed like the only option to prevent the villainous femme from annhilating Laurelblaze right in front of her but Icestar refused to play her merciless game. There was no guarantee that she would follow through on her promise and Icestar wanted to remain here in the real world to make sure Silentwing never returned so how could she reverse the stakes? What would trick Silentwing? A fake death, perhaps? How could she accomplish that if her soul was going to be literally ripped out? 

<em>Oh.</em> 

That was the key there. The average body housed one soul but reincarnated ones...That was where Silentwing was going to be fooled. While the tortoiseshell’s fearsome trick would kill Laurelblaze, Icestar was going to survive it. After all, she had two souls in this particular vessel. While she still didn’t know what would happen to her other soul once this was ripped out, it will still survive and the hostage situation would be removed. This was a good enough result for her. If there were side effects to this risky plan and she rendered herself too disabled to fight, another was going to battle in her stead for the sake of the Clan. She didn’t care how Silentwing went down. All that mattered was that she did.

The cold smirk enveloped her white maw.

<strong>” Let’s do it but first, let her go.”</strong></span>

Emptiness. Shadows. Disarray. 

For what felt like eternity, Icestar was drowning. She couldn’t find her place. Unaware of the victory that she led her Clan to. She felt as if she was everywhere but nowhere at the same time. Conscious yet unconscious. Something that had been here before was now gone and she didn’t know what it could be or if she was even aware of it. Sometimes she was. Sometimes she wasn’t. 

Finally, this endless torment ceased and faint, miniscule, almost nonexistent breaths were made from her prone body. Laurelblaze and Dustycloud had dashed towards Hollyfrost leaving one warrior alone with the body of ThunderClan’s leader. Ghosts of words whispered in her ears: <em>I’m sorry.</em> 

A dark ear twitched.

<em>I’m sorry.</em>

A warm face buried into her side. 

Carefully, the lynx-point shifted, testing the controls of her body.

It was working.

Familiar blue-green eyes slowly opened and looked at Bearmask with wonder. Pure love filled her chest at the sight of him. The emotion was as strong as ever. It filled her deepest core and enveloped her in the most comforting warmth imaginable. If only she could recognize him, she would’ve whispered in assurance: <em>I love you.</em> A promise. Instead, her lips formed a question, voice croaking with confusion: 

<strong>” Who are you?”</strong>

He felt it skip a beat when he saw teal eyes looking straight back at him. <strong>”Icestar?”</strong> He didn’t even bother trying to wipe the tears from his face. His heart was swelling with more joy than he ever thought possible. It felt different from the satisfaction he received from a victory in combat, more light and steady. However, it was soon diminished by a single question. <em>Who are you?</em>

Bearmask didn’t even know how to answer the question initially. For a moment, he wondered if she was joking, but the look in her eyes told him otherwise. Bearmask should have felt sad in that moment, but he found himself being more relieved than anything. He used a paw to pull her closer to his chest, closing his eyes and taking in the she-cat’s familiar scent. In that moment, he found himself remembering the words his mentor, Wolfcry, always appeared to say. He repeated them back to her.

<strong>”It’s okay now. I’m here.”</strong>

Despite the fact she never wanted to leave Hollyfrost&#39;s side, nearly wanting to be buried with her, she couldn&#39;t help but to be stirred when she saw that Icestar was <em>alive</em>.

<strong>&quot;Icestar?&quot;</strong> she whispered aloud, her voice almost a whisper at the end of the word from her continued sobbing. She was still with them, she had risen from the dead. Her friend was here... 

<strong>&quot;Icestar! You&#39;re al-&quot;</strong> she cut herself off  upon hearing what she had just said. <em>&quot;Who are you?&quot;... to Bearmask.</em> Her puffy eyes widened as she stared at the scene unfolding before her, looking to Bearmask in confusion. How did she <em>not</em> remember him? The father of her kits, <em>her mate?</em> <strong>&quot;Marigolddust... Someone get Marigolddust!&quot;</strong> she called for the tuxedo tom to appear in the clearing, there was something off about her behavior.

<em>Was it because her soul was taken? How is she even alive?</em>

Marigolddust was called away from Wrenpaw&#39;s side by the deputy&#39;s voice, panicked, confused, and greivious.  Concern had been the first reaction to hit him, moments before his fear had elevated even more.  Why was he being called?  What was happening?  Panic rushed through him, and with a quick and rushed movement, he silently requested Beanspark&#39;s aid in watching over his apprentice.  Once Wrenpaw&#39;s well being had being secured, Marigolddust turned and, after nudging past all of the elders, queens, and kits, ran out into the camp, only to be stopped by the sight.  Blood lay everywhere, along with bodies of cats who had left Thunderclan&#39;s ranks to join Starclan.  His heart sank.  He knew that the situation had been bad- for Starclan&#39;s sake, he had dragged some of the most injured cats into his den.  But walking out and seeing <em>this</em>, this sight instead of the place he remembered so fondly considering his home and safe place... well, saying that it broke his heart was an understatement.  He wasn&#39;t sure if he would be able to look at the camp the same way without remembering all of the blood- the bodies of the cats he was too slow to save.  

                But he was being called.  Only Laurelblaze&#39;s voice booming his name once more dragged his attention off of the ruin of the camp, instead bringing it up to the highledge, where multiple of his clanmates were waiting.  With his heart in his throat, Marigolddust made his climb up the ledge swiftly, leaping from one stone to the next with surprising ease, despite his shaking paws and quivering form.  When his paws finally landed on the top of the platform, his heart sank.  Lemon-toned hues were glued to Icestar, laying on the stone surrounded by loved ones.  Something seemed... off about her.  But she was alive, and he was more than relieved.  Laurelblaze, Icestar, and Wrenpaw had all made it out alive.. but he didn&#39;t dare try to guess who else might not be.</span>

                Relieved, Marigolddust padded up to them, deciding not to leave Laurelblaze waiting.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Starclan, I&#39;m so glad you guys are alive,&quot;</em></strong></em>  he said, his voice shaky.  He paused when he noticed the looks on the faces of the cats around him, frowning a bit as confusion blurred his thoughts.  Was someone hurt?  Was that why he was called?  Well, clearly, multiple &#39;someone&#39;s had been hurt.  Perhaps they wanted to alert them of their victory, although it didn&#39;t look much like one.  No, they wouldn&#39;t have sounded so worried... so what was it?  Fear began to return, making his chest feel tight as he looked up at Laurelblaze.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Is.. is everything alright?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked, before cringing.  The question seemed so... <em>wrong</em>... when everything was clearly not alright.  Shamefully, he decided to rephrase.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I-I mean, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;</em></strong></em>

It was finally over...but as he slowly gazed around the camp, his golden orbs were full of sadness at the price that had been paid to win the battle. He was more than thankful to StarClan for making it out alive, and the scars he now carried would remind him of how close he had come to losing his own life, but there was a part of him that wished he could trade places with someone else so they could get the chance to continue living. <em>What am I thinking? I&#39;m still here for a reason. I can continue serving my clan in whatever way possible.</em> Shaking out his orange fur that was now covered in blood that was partly his own and partly others, he began to get to work. 

Lionfur started going around camp to check on those who needed assistance from being badly injured, wanting to make sure they got the herbs and healing they needed to recover without putting much strain on their bodies to get from one place to another. After helping someone to the medicine den, he glanced around for the next clanmate to help, his gaze landing on Willowberry before making his way over to the feline. <strong>&quot;Are you alright?&quot;</strong> He asked softly, quickly looking her over for any serious wounds as he waited for a response.

Marigolddust had been put in quite the panic when he had first laid eyes on the outcome of the battle.  Of course he was relieved that they had won, but the losses that they experienced were worse than he would have ever wished.  Icestar had lost her memories, and Marigolddust had lost a friend... Even if he wasn&#39;t yet aware of the fact.  A rarely deep frown was plastered across his features, his gaze full of concern, pain, and grief as he looked out at all of the bodies.  None of them belonged to the dark forest cats, of course, as the bodies of said cats had vanished if they had managed to get finished off.  No, instead, only one or two traitors lie among the dead here, and it was terrifying.  Shaking, Marigolddust went from body to body, pressing a paw against each carcasses neck to try and search for some sign of life.  More often than not, there was none to be found.  Holding his breath, Marigolddust tried not to let any of his guilt-filled tears fall.  These were all cats he might have been able to save, had he been brave enough to run out and do so.  But he hadn&#39;t been, and here they were now, lifeless.  <em>I just hope they joined Starclan,</em> he prayed, after checking one more body with the same results.</span>

                Finally, his eyes landed on a cat who wasn&#39;t dead.  For a moment, she thought she had been- but she wasn&#39;t sprawled out on the ground like everyone else.  She was crouched besides the body of an elder, accompanied by kits.  She was clearly injured, and as soon as he registered that he could save her, he hurried towards the apprentice.  When he was close enough, he recognized the fem as one of Holly and Laurelblaze&#39;s kits.  Despite the fact that he rarely ever remembered the names to cats he didn&#39;t know we&#39;ll, her name came to his mind almost immediately.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Tigerpaw!  Starclan, are you alright?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, approached her side.  He had brought herbs with him for patching up open wounds, hoping that he would find a cat he might still be able to save.  Unfortunately, he wouldn&#39;t be able to save the elder who lay Infront of the apprentice and the kits.  They were already gone.  Quietly, he sent a quick lick to one of the kit&#39;s heads, finding that they were shivering and hoping to bring them warmth.  Whether they were truly shivering from the cold or the trauma of it all, he wasn&#39;t sure.

Tigerpaw didn&#39;t dare to let herself nor the kits run out of the bramble bush. Even if the roars and screeches of the battle had died down, the apprentices instincts screamed at her to stay in cover and.  &#39;<em>Don&#39;t. Move.</em>&#39; 

Not even to risk moving the deceased elder out of their hiding spot, that would&#39;ve blown Tigerpaws plan to try and keep the calico kittens safe from the hellfire that was happening in camp. Danger screamed each and every corner, and Tigerpaw was in no condition to lure the kits out of camp — She didn&#39;t trust the youngsters to make a run for it by themselves, nor herself to drag her injuries and kits with her for the safe lands of outside the warzone. They were safe inside the bramble thickets, the entrance was so close yet — So far, too far for Tigerpaws liking. 

The apprentice kept herself low as the spiky brambles pressed against her torn fur. Her bushy tail tightly curled around her slim frame to make space for the three kittens.

 A reeling metal ardor oozed from the wound running down her shoulder as blood did so too, drenching the white parts of her coat in a cherry-stewed mix with soft white. She could barely feel her left ear. A sigh cried out of the young molly as the kits huddled close to eachother — Eyes shut as their pelts spiked to produce warmth for their little bodies. Something Tigerpaw couldn&#39;t do due to the harsh stinging from her injuries when she moved. Her back ankle felt crooked, a terrible gash starting up to her shoulder and down to her paw, barely any right ear to end it off. 

&#39;<em>What now?</em>&#39;

Then, it seemed as if her silent cries were heard, but from the right cats.</span>

Marigolddust hadn&#39;t exacted to find a survivor after all of the lost cats he had looked over, but now that he had, he could feel nothing but relief... Well, almost nothing.  The idea of Tigerpaw hiding out in the brambles with the kits and a passed elder wasn&#39;t the happiest one.  Sure, it had kept them safe from danger during the battle, but it also provided them with front row seats to watch everything happen.  He couldn&#39;t help but wonder if Tigerpaw had been stuck here just to watch as Laurelblaze&#39;s soul was almost ripped out of her, or whether she had been able to be by Holly&#39;s side when she had passed.  He still couldn&#39;t wrap his mind over the idea od the dark-furred fem being gone, but he had never really met her well enough to grieve as much as he wished he could.  He felt guilty at the saft that he couldn&#39;t, just as he had when Beetlestreak had disappeared and died.</span>

              Tigerpaw&#39;s relief to see him revealed that she had been more than on edge.  Was she aware that the battle had ended a few moments ago?  Or did she still think that it was raging, taking the lives of the cats not as lucky as her and these kits?  He sent a glance to the passed elder, curious and pained as he examined the body with a quick glance.  He didn&#39;t exactly recognize the cat, but it was never easy to look at a cat who&#39;s life was no more, especially when said cat was surrounded by cats that should have been too young to see such a thing.  Dragging his eyes off of the lifeless body, he focused on the kits as Tigerpaw voiced her concern for them.  <em><strong><em>&quot;The kits?  Let me see-&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, trailing off as he carefully looked over each of the three kittens.  He used his own paws to gingerly raise theirs, examining them.  It seemed that the blood on their flanks weren&#39;t their own, and they were only cold and traumatized.  

              <em><strong><em>&quot;They&#39;re fine, don&#39;t worry, alright?  They&#39;re just a little cold.  Grooming them should warm them up some...&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, sending a few more licks I&#39;ve the kit closest to him in an attempt to warm them, grooming them the opposite way so that the action would work faster.  Once he was finished, he paused to look back up at Tigerpaw and her own injuries.  He felt his non-existent brows to furrow even more when he noticed her crooked paw.  <em><strong><em>&quot;You look worse than they do.  Where are you hurt?  That paws not normally like that.. is it?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, inching close to her to glance over the multiple different injuries.  The apprentice clearly needed help, but he wasn&#39;t sure if she would accept it.

The salty drops of tears trickling down the tom’s cheeks confused her even more. <em>Why was he crying?</em> Thinking about it too much only brought forward more pain to her already pulsing headache. Why did she love him when she barely met him? Why couldn’t she remember anything from before she opened her eyes? 

<strong>” Icestar? Who is Icestar?”</strong> The lynx-point whispered out quietly, examining his shocked expression. <strong>” I’m Iceheart.”</strong> That’s right. She remembered <em>that</em>.

A breathless squeak escaped from her lungs as the stranger pulled her to his chest. The scent was familiar, strengthening the love she already felt for him. His words were oddly comforting. <em>Everything will be alright.</em> She blocked out the fear scents lingering in the air. The panicked calls and quick paw steps. She concentrated on the beating of this tom’s heart, letting its relaxing pulse bring her peace.

For a while, he kept his nose buried behind Icestar’s ear, until eventually pulling away to answer Marigolddust’s question. <strong>”She lost her memories,”</strong> Bearmask explained, understanding the situation almost immediately. <strong>”A few moons back, she told me there were two souls residing within her. I didn’t believe her at the time, but…”</strong> His voice trailed off, eyes full of regret as he remembered that day. <strong>”Icestar sacrificed one of her souls when she lost her final life,”</strong> he continued. <strong>”Now she’s only left with one.”</strong> Which soul it was, Bearmask was not certain. <strong>”Losing one of her souls probably caused the memories of it to disappear too.”</strong>  


He couldn’t help but wonder: which soul was it that he became so close to? Did it really matter? He didn’t know, but he wasn’t going to dwell on it now. Maybe there was still hope that she would regain some of her memories. If that was the case, Bearmask would stop at nothing to get them back. He didn’t care how long it took. He wasn’t going to let her go. He was never going to give up. What kind of a warrior would he be if he did. What kind of a mate…

The ThunderClan deputy couldn’t believe what she was hearing, it didn’t seem plausible. Two souls residing within one cat? Was that how she survived? She was nearly rendered speechless by the revelation, and she stared down at the wounded lynx-point she-cat in bewilderment. <strong>”Icestar, it’s me, Laurelblaze, your deputy. Marigolddust here is your medicine cat.”</strong> she’d gestured to the tuxedo tom, trying to see if somehow she could jog her memory, to see if it would do <em>something.</em>

<em>She can’t forget about us all, all the times we’d sparred together, fought side by side? It can’t be true it just can’t!</em>

<strong>”You’re the leader of ThunderClan, you’re Icestar! I’m your second in command… You… You don’t recognize me?”</strong> her eyes widened, and a frown was visibly plastered upon her features, and she glanced over to Marigolddust in desperation, if he had some way to treat this anomaly.

The battle. The events that unfolded after it. It was something she didn’t expect. She was still quite shocked from it. The wounds she got from the battle weren’t bad, but she felt bad for the fallen ones. She sat with one of her hind legs placed weirdly. That was the location of her more serious wound. It didn’t need immediate attention. Other than that she was alright. She lifted a white paw to clean it. She had just cleaned her other wounds but forgot about her paws
<span class="pre pre--inline">Are you alright?</span>
A voice spoke. Willow’s ears perked up, looking at the tom who came up to her. <strong>”Oh I’m fine!”</strong> The cream and white she-cat answered. <strong>”What about you?”</strong>

<em><strong><em>- Past -</em></strong></em>

<em><strong><em>&quot;Lost her memories?&quot;</em></strong></em> Marigolddust repeated, shock radiating off of his form as quickly as the sun&#39;s rays when the words hit his ears.  He hardly registered the details of it or how it worked, although he tried his best take take as many mental notes as possible.  The whole idea seemed so... <em>Confusing</em>.  Personally, Marigolddust had only ever heard of cats reincarnating in the stories the elders used to tell him as a kit.  The fact that the Icestar he had known was really a cat who had been reincarnated into the point&#39;s body would have put him in even more surprise, but, fortunately, he was yet to hear of this news in particular.  Even now, he found himself forgetting what Bearmask&#39;s explanation had been, staring at the silver furred fem at his side.  He would need to ask Bearmask more about it later, or at least to repeat what he had said just moments ago.  

                He was too distracted and confused to be able to try and keep track of anything more than the warrior&#39;s first answer; <em>&#39;she lost her memories.&#39;</em>  It sounded like an impossible problem to receive, yet alone fix.  Was that why he was called?  To try and cure whatever had happened to Icestar?  Marigolddust felt butterflies in his stomach, although unlike the common, colorful insects found in green-leaf, they felt as if they were made of the same darkness as Silentwing&#39;s ended existence, itching to crawl up his neck and to his brain.  Maybe then he could pass out, let this all be postponed momentarily so he could get a handle on things.  But he pushed this terrible feeling down, trying to focus.  This was his job, and he had to do it well.  Otherwise, what use was he, being here?</span>

                Marigolddust watched helplessly as Laurelblaze tried to jog Icestar&#39;s memories, trying to bring back the version of her that seemed to have been taken away with Silentwing.  He felt his own form freeze when Laurelblaze turned her odd gaze over to him, and he held back the urge to admit he had as little idea on how to fix this as her.  Instead, he held his breath as he slowely approached her.  Casting Bearmask a quick glance to warn of his approach, Marigolddust crouched down to face Icestar face-to-face, yellows meeting sea-green blues.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Icestar?  Do you... Do you remember anything?  Does anybody here seem recognizable?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked.  He couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing.  It didn&#39;t seem possible- Icestar couldn&#39;t have forgotten all of them.  She had to know at least one of them, didn&#39;t she?  She had to... How couldn&#39;t she?  

                 Yet the stormy pelted medic couldn&#39;t help but wonder whether this really was true.  Would those moons of bonding have been for nothing?  The redemption from their poor first introduction?  The time she had sacrificed her own life to save his?  She had to remember something, <em>anything</em>.  He had to fix her, find out how to put her back to normal... He had to at least do that to thank her for everything, to pay her back all of the kind words and guidance she had given him ever since his early days as an apprentice.  If he could have, he might have even tried to offer his own life in exchange for her memories, as she had done so for him not much more than a moon ago.

The deep rumbling of this tom’s voice only enhanced the safety she felt in his embrace. It was unfortunate that it did not last long. She heard another approach her. At least, she thought it was herself, especially since she was being referred to as ‘Icestar’ - the same name the tom had called her. A bashful peek was sent to the outside world - to the large, dappled she-cat standing before her. A sense of friendship restlessly moved within her chest. <em>Why?</em> She didn’t understand what the feline was talking about. <em>ThunderClan? Leader? Second-in Command?</em> The lynx-point didn’t know how to respond. They were expecting something of her and she didn’t know what. Her ears folded back, upset. 

Then the third one spoke up. She hadn’t noticed him until he had snuck up right in front of her. At first, she shrank back into the brown fur surrounding her before meeting the gentle gaze with her own fearful ones. This time pride and affection bubbled within her.

<strong>” Remember what? I am supposed to remember something?”</strong> She glanced over to the powerful-looking femme and then up to the fern-green eyes of the tabby. <strong>” No. I don’t know them. Am I supposed to know them? Is this some sort of test?”</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">After tending to Icestar for a bit, Bearmask came out into camp to try and help out with the aftermath of the battle wherever he could. As much as he wanted to stay with Icestar, he knew he had responsibilities to uphold as a warrior. Wolfcry would have told him the same.

Wolfcry… Bearmask found himself thinking a lot about his deceased mentor recently. For a while, he was the one cat he ever looked up to in his life. More specifically, it was the way in which he always arose victorious after every battle that caught his gleaming eyes as an apprentice. Looking back on it now, he realized that there was a lot more that Wolfcry brought to the table when it came to being one of the greatest warriors. Bearmask would have to learn to surpass that if he wanted to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming an even greater warrior than Wolfcry.

He looked around camp, searching for something to do. The fresh-kill pile was pretty bare, but the borders probably haven’t been marked in a while either. Both tasks were usually performed by a patrol of warriors and apprentices, but he doubted there would be enough cats to even be in the proper condition to carry them out. Bearmask had taken quite a few hits, but he was left with less severe injuries than those of other cats, so he was let out of the medicine cat’s den pretty easily. There was no need to waste the space on his wounds when there were more serious ones to be treated.

The russet tom sighed quietly as an overwhelming sense of silence now rested over the den. Outside was quiet too. At least for a moment. A sudden eerie peacefulness had fallen over those of Thunderclan, but now various cries were coming from outside of the den. The warrior rested his head upon the cream-colored feline beside him, momentarily closing his eyes and forcing his breathing steady. His ear twitched at her words, followed by amber optics appearing once more, whiskers quivering just a tad. <strong>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want you to...&quot;</strong>
    For a while longer, Cardinalspark merely sat there. Now he arose, nudging her side a bit. <strong>&quot;Come on. We should get the kits out of here. It seems like the battle is over...&quot;</strong> Slowly, the tom arose, limping a bit as he made his way to the den&#39;s entrance. As he made it outside, the camp looked even worse than the den. Blood and bodies were scattered about, the stench of death overwhelming. His amber gaze flickered over to various felines, some mourning, some injured and those who were no more. <strong>&quot;This is worse than the mudslide...&quot;</strong> he muttered mostly to himself, tail held just above the ground.

Looking rather miserable from her prison, the she-cat’s gaze wandered around her clanmates. They were broken, tired and exhausted. They meandered around with such sadness and defeat. She gulped as some of them eyed her with disdain.
Coyotepaw had escorted her to where the other traitors were being held. She sat and watched as everything unfolded. Did she feel bad about everything? Yes she did. She regretted all of it. But at least her kits were ok. The cramping had stopped eventually. Seeing Needlestripe next to her, she couldn’t help but suppress a sigh. She needed to tell him about the pregnancy, but when would be the right time?

<strong>” What do you think they’re going to do with us now?”</strong> she asked sadly.

The conspirators sat in awkward silence, grooming their wounds. Silentwing was gone, Deerbounce had abandoned them, Frozenmink was killed. He watched his apprentice, Foxpaw, painfully mourn the death of his mother in the center of the bloody camp. A she-cat’s worried voice brought him from his thoughts.

Instinctively as he turned he licked her ear comfortingly. At least Wolfshine was okay. Icestar wasn’t dead, but she was in no condition to lead, and that was good enough for him. <strong>”I don’t know,”</strong> replied the tom quietly, snuggling her closer.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Wolfprowl watched from a safe distance and with solemn expression as the pity party gathered around Hollyfrost’s body. Deerbounce had done that to her, and she’d been protecting Viperpaw before she died. If he’d been able to keep the dark forest cat’s attention on him, maybe she’d still be alive. Instead of indulging in guilt though, there was another body he had to worry about. Similar dark fur, but with purple eyes.

His brother the medicine cat was making the healing rounds now, checking on the injured and confirming deaths. While the lighter tuxedo tom hovered over yet another patient, his warrior littermate stood behind. Wolfprowl shifted but did not approach, standing dutifully beside the body of their sister. <strong>”Marigolddust…”</strong> his voice was gentle with weariness but held no warmth. The news he bore but could not bring himself to say was not welcome.

When the medic turned he would be greeted with an unthinkable sight: Lilachaze, succumbed to her injuries, violet eyes but hollow slits in her skull, while Wolfprowl’s tail rested lightly on her cold figure. His were numerous, chunks torn from his mane, but not deep or severe. Another one of their family gone. <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">This was almost too depressing—as if things weren&#39;t already depressing enough. Laurelblaze&#39;s desperate cries were, unfortunately, all in vain. <strong>&quot;There&#39;s no point,&quot;</strong> he growled, eyes narrowing. He couldn&#39;t help but think that Silentwing had gotten off all too easily. There was no place cruel enough for a cat like her. The chaos she’d stirred was unlike anything he had ever seen, and Bearmask was sure that he’d seen plenty. He clenched his teeth, eyes burning softly with anger, making a silent oath never to let someone like her do this to his Clan ever again.

Bearmask watched as Marigolddust approached, asking questions to try and gauge the severity of Icestar’s memory loss, it seemed. Unsurprisingly, Icestar remembered nothing of the questions brought up. Bearmask didn’t respond to Icestar’s inquiry, knowing it would take quite a while to wrap everything around the confused she-cat’s head. Of course, he would make sure to tell it all to her later. She deserved to know every bit of what events had transpired leading up to this point.

<strong>”I’ll tell her everything about what happened later,”</strong> Bearmask said, looking over at Laurelblaze and Marigolddust. <strong>”Aside from her memory loss, she seems to be fine physically. Until she regains her memories,”</strong> he said as if it were something he would make certain happened, <strong>”I’ll stick around with her.”</strong> If he had to teach her how to be a warrior again, then so be it.

<strong>”You’ll have to lead the Clan now,”</strong> he looked over at Laurelblaze, letting the weight of his comment seep into his eyes, as if telling her to <em>suck it up and get ready.</em> <strong>”There’s no telling how long this will last, and Icestar can’t lead with all of her memories gone.”</strong> They were what made her a leader, after all.

Bearmask&#39;s words stung in her ears upon hearing them, and her head turned to face him, her gaze burning with indignation at the mere thought. <strong>&quot;She&#39;s alive, and she hasn&#39;t stepped down. I am her deputy and I will not undermine her rule as leader of ThunderClan, we do not know how long this will last. It can be temporary and her memories could come back, I won&#39;t disrespect her like that!&quot;</strong> she growled, pupils narrowing to slits as she stared back down at the lynx-point she-cat who was wrapped around Bearmask, pain flooding her gaze as she felt guilt at the mere thought of taking over. It felt wrong.

<em>She gave up her soul for me, I won&#39;t take her place from her, she&#39;ll be fine, I know she will! She has to!</em>

Her ears flattened against her skull, in the meantime she&#39;d be acting as leader in her place, until she recovered. She was stubborn and refused to believe she wasn&#39;t going to get better right away, Icestar was her clan&#39;s leader, and she swore her loyalty to her and to ThunderClan. <strong>&quot;Get her to a nest in the medicine cat den, and help anyone who needs assistance getting there. We can&#39;t afford to lose more warriors, not after what happened today.&quot;</strong> then, she turned to her clanmates around camp, at least the ones still standing and conscious.

<strong>&quot;And as for the traitors, make sure they are guarded at all times. Those fox-hearts are to be watched until I give them their sentencing, and do not treat them with kindness.&quot;</strong>

She would not tolerate disloyalty to her clan after what they were just put through, after what Icestar gave up to save them all.

<em>There&#39;s no point.</em>  Deep in his chest, Marigolddust knew that the words were more likely to be true than not.  He had never witnessed a cat who had lost their memories, especially not a cat who couldn&#39;t even recognize what she had once known as her common life.  But, despite this, he felt his ears swerve back.  He wanted to continue to help her, to try and fix her here and now so that Laurelblaze didn&#39;t need to go through the pain of believing her memories couldn&#39;t be restored.  He wanted to reassure the others in the camp.. he wanted to reassure himself.  He wanted to make Icestar feel comfortable, instead of feeling this guilt in his gut every time she felt she was being interrogated.  Taking in a breath, his breathing showed the first signs of shakiness as he exhaled.  

                    <em><strong><em>&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, Ice... Iceheart, I didn&#39;t mean to make this seem like a test.  We&#39;re just... we&#39;re just trying to help you, okay?&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, speaking quietly as he hesitantly took a step back.  Icestar was clearly confused, and he was only making it worse.  He wanted to try again, to ask more questions to try to jog her memory, but he knew he couldn&#39;t.  He shouldn&#39;t.  Bearmask would have this handled.  It seemed he wanted them to leave the first step to him, anyways.  Marigolddust knew that Icestar&#39;s mate would likely have the most chance of bringing back some recognition behind Icestar&#39;s eyes, even if he wished he could be more useful in that moment.</span>

                   Marigolddust went quiet as Bearmask gave Laurelblaze the news that the deputy clearly didn&#39;t want to hear, or accept.  He hushed himself as Laurelblaze spoke back, quite harshly, but also honorably.  Silently, he listened as she spoke, not planning to say anything in opposition, but also unsure whether her words would turn out true.  He could easily imagine Laurelblaze being an amazing leader in the future, perhaps a future that was too quickly coming, but he didn&#39;t know how he would deal with the change of Icestar not leading him and the rest of Thunderclan.  He was aware of a time when Laurelblaze had been in charge of the clan while Icestar was absent, but he hadn&#39;t been born then.  

                   He was too young to remember any of that, and the idea of seeing something so similar to the stories he had heard made him feel resentful.  He didn&#39;t speak a word, though, and tried to stay away from the idea of what their future would look like or where it would lead them.  Instead, he bowed his head to Laurelblaze and looked over to Bearmask, waiting for the warrior and Icestar to follow.  Maybe he could try and think up something better, more useful, when they were in his den.  As he waited, he held his gathering tears back with a meek string, hoping that they would go away until he found a moment of privacy.  A moment he wouldn&#39;t be getting for awhile, it seemed; at least, not in his own den.

       She had only watched it unfold from afar. When the traitors were gone and dealt with, Cypress hobbled there, adrenaline simmering but her heartbeat made the virago’s body rhythmically vibrate. Weakened, she had earned a clearly distinguishable scar across her features, an occuli pinched shut to prevent the blood getting into her vision. And she had only watched. Within a day, the world had turned upside down. Significant warriors have taken on an absented valediction from the rest of the clan while others were shaken from the battle and the shock of recognizing the faces of the traitors. And then there was IceStar. Or Ice<em>Heart</em> now, rather. An entirely new cat, but in the same body. It all seemed far too fictional. Her apprenticeship did not prepare her for the fictional possibilities. Did not prepare to spot Finchbrair. And not adjacent to her on the battlefield, but on the antithesis of it all. She was not in sight of her friend&#39;s side profile, but the complete front view. It was head on. Not battle <em>with</em> but battle <em>against</em>.  So now, forgive her - but she only stood there as IceStars failed to regain her memories.</span>

    BearMask was her mentor prior to her promotion to warrior. He taught her well. Certainly without his teachings, she would have been an easy twig to snap just a moment earlier. As strict as he was, she was grateful for him. 
    Watching as the misanthrope strode across camp, following his line of gaze to the fresh kill pile and beyond the camp. His mind was geared into distraction. Cypress could only imagine his state. Of course he needed to busy himself. 
    Stepping from her spot, the xanthippe - by force of habit, hurriedly made her way to her former mentor. Both aged with scars and time. 
    <em>Time, both a healer and a killer.</em>
    <strong>&quot;The fresh kill pile needs replenishing,&quot;</strong> MarigoldDust had more severe wounds to tend to, Cypress can handle hers. Her previously shut eye was now held open, completely functional.</span>

As he pressed closer, she couldn’t help but notice how angry and red his wounds looked. She had heard that he attacked Icestar, and Laurelblaze had enacted revenge. To be honest, she was very unhappy with the deputy. Why scratch him up like that? Of course, she could have seen that her clanmate had made a mistake? Needlestripe was in pain because of her! 
Trying to hide her anger, she lapped the tom’s face. He hadn’t received much healing at all. Those scratches on his face would leave permanent scars.
<strong>” I’m so sorry I couldn’t  fight beside you. You’re hurt, and it’s my fault. I was just trying.. to well… stay safe I guess. I wasn’t feeling to well either.”</strong> she nuzzled closer, <strong>” Do you forgive me?”</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">There were many things in this life that Smokingshore was unsure of - one of them, for instance, was perhaps the meaning of life itself. What exactly was the payoff of being on earth for so long? Was there a payoff? She couldn’t say that she was all too certain - it was a fascinating subject, the thought of life after death. Of course, she believed in StarClan, although maybe not to the extent of some others, but the belief was there. She did think that life existed after death, but she wasn’t sure to what extent - perhaps the soul goes on to meet another lost traveler. Or perhaps she had been wrong her entire life. Who’s to say one wasn’t more possible than the other? After all, it would humble her to be proven wrong - not that she was humble enough already. 

In the shadow of the rising sun, anything is possible, at least that’s how the tortoiseshell looked at things - the sun rises everyday to give you a chance to try again. In that shadow, a silhouette could be made out already sitting near the warrior den - that’s right, she was awake and as ready as ever! She couldn’t tell exactly what time it was, because cats can’t tell time to the extent that everyone else can, but she figured it was nearing full daybreak. She had went to sleep quite early the night before and. . . In this moment, to say the least, she felt like she could carry the world on her shoulders without a dent to show for it. And hell, maybe she could.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Needlestripe recoiled slightly and couldn’t suppress a hiss as her tongue stung his wounds. Then he cleared his throat and shook his head. <strong>”Never in a million moons would I be mad at you,”</strong> he nuzzled her softly. <strong>”If I could’ve made you stay on the opposite side of the lake I would.”</strong> It was true. Besides not being able to take Icestar out himself, having to devote his attention elsewhere from the beautiful white she-cat beside him was all he regretted about the battle, about everything they had done. He was relived she was safe. His gaze drifted helplessly back to the darkening camp and silence settled between them again. With leafbare approaching, could ThunderClan afford to exile more warriors after the ones they had lost? Their future was uncertain, but whatever happened, Needlestripe knew one thing.

<strong>”Be my mate, Wolfshine,”</strong> he blurted the words, shattering the silence, without sparing her a glance. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span></span>

Guilt continued to ravage her, even with Needlestripe’s comforting words. He would do anything to protect her, and she knew that he would protect their future kits as well. Would now be a good time to tell him?
No. No it’s couldn’t be. His wounds were fresh. His anger still present. He may not be happy at all if she told him. Was he ready to be a father?
Most importantly, was she ready to be a mother?

Before glancing a sorrowful look his way, her ears rung with an surprising statement.
<em>Be my mate Wolfshine</em>
Her eyes widened in surprise. He wants that? Of course, they loved each other, but being mates would seal the deal. She finally would have everything she wanted, a loyal mate.. and a family. Maybe Silentwing was right. Maybe she could have everything she ever wanted.
She nuzzled him, and licked his cheek. <strong>” I will Needlestripe,”</strong> she said lovingly, <strong>” That’s all I’ve ever wanted. To spend eternity with you.”</strong>
It didn’t matter what happened now. Whether they lived as prisoners forever, or lived someplace on their own. As long as they had each other, everything would be alright.

<em><strong><em>- Post Battle -</em></strong></em>

The young medicine cat was occupied healing a cat who had earned a large gash to the back of their head during the battle.  Marigolddust was relieved that the warrior hadn&#39;t died from the injuries, although they had been injured bad enough to be included in the cats who he was to heal first.  None of the first cats that he was healing could move enough to be able to reach his den as a result of how major their injuries were, and because of this, he would bring what the needed of his den to them.  His webs were matted with sticky cobwebs in certain places, such as between his toes (it would be a bother to take care of later), but he paid no mind to the mess.  These cats were all in grave danger, but, fortunately, this was the last of the bunch.  After he finished patching up this clanmate of his, he would be able to move onto an even larger group who had made it to his den.  Unfortunately, it seemed he was the only one who would be healing from now on, or at least from now until he was told otherwise.  

                  Beanspark had disappeared, and Marigolddust was worried sick.  The tortoiseshell was nowhere to be seen, and Marigolddust could only hope that Beanspark had made it out of the battle, instead of joining the casualties.  If his lack of experience led to the young Skyclan medic&#39;s, he may as well have started a whole new war, and Thunderclan had had enough of those by now.  Not go mention that he, personally, would be unable to work or concentrate through the guilty grief.  But, so far, the other medicine cat&#39;s body hadn&#39;t been found, but there were much more to be identified.</span>

                 When Marigolddust had placed the last of the cobwebs on the back of the injured cat&#39;s head, he was distracted by his own name being spoken, instead of those of the deathly injured Thunderclanners.  Straightening, Marigolddust glanced around for who had spoken his name until his eyes landed on Wolfprowl.  Resentment and relief both sprung through his mind when he took notice of Wolfprowl&#39;s lack of deadly injuries, although these were both overrun by bewilderment as he realized how morbid his brother&#39;s expression was.  Realizing Wolfprowl&#39;s grief stricken expression, Marigolddust looked down at the cat at his brother&#39;s paws.  There, in front of him and next to his brother, was his sister, Lilachaze.  A confused shock ran through him, causing his eyes to widen and his jaw to tighten.  The emotions in his chest were confused, mixed and switched continually as his heart tried to come up wit the proper lost of emotions he should have been feeling.  

                Marigolddust had never had much luck with his siblings, and hardly even knew them, besides perhaps Daisyglow and Wolfprowl.  Even since his trip outside of camp with Wolfprowl when they both were kits, he had been hesitant around his siblings.  His youngest sister&#39;s death and mother&#39;s neglect only burnt the bridges further.  By the time he had become an apprentice, he had prefered his makeshift family of him, Fernpaw, Rooksnap, and others much more than his true family.  Friendship had always been a stronger bond in his life than blood, especially recently, and as a result he felt complicated, looking down at his sister&#39;s lifeless body.  Lilachaze had done nothing to him, had given him no reason to be out of his life.  But it had been Marigolddust&#39;s own discomfort towards his family that put him in the place he was now.</span>

Guilt traveled through his veins instead of blood, making his heart beat as fast as if it were adrenaline.  Shakily, he took a step forward, checking one final time to make sure the black tabby had no pulse.  There was nothing.  <em><strong><em>&quot;W-w-what happened?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, tripping over his own words as he stood there on shock.  He never took his eyes off of Lilachaze&#39;s lifeless lavender ones as he spoke.

It was true, the family had never been close. He had made sure of that.

The wounds from the battle that ravaged their camp were still fresh, and the loss felt by the entire clan was palpable in the air. Laurelblaze too, felt immense and heavy grief, but she had a rather thorough talking-to by their medicine cat that made her feel only a small fraction better— but it was <em>something</em>. Knowing she had a friend standing by her side and ready to support her leadership, even if their ancestors said otherwise, was comforting. She didn’t know what the future of ThunderClan would be, but she knew she could guide them to a brighter one. She was tired of them suffering at the claws of villains hellbent on bringing them harm, and to be seen as easy targets by the others. She knew for certain she’d be ensuring their warriors were formidable and strong, ones not to be taken so lightly if they ever found themselves in battle.

<em>They will scorch the earth beneath their paws if they have to, we will not be living in fear ever again.</em>

First things first, however, they needed to heal, in more ways than one. The wounds of the body could not compare to the wounds upon the very soul of the clan, and after moons of fighting and waiting for their enemies to show themselves, she felt relief. Even in the face of so much loss, their enemies were vanquished, they had a better future to look forward to.

<em>One I wish I could have shared with Hollyfrost…</em>

She closed her eyes for a moment, her teeth clenching within her jaw. Of course she wouldn’t let go of her grief over her mate’s loss so easily, Hollyfrost meant the world to her. She would have done anything for her and the family they had together. Her loss was devastating, and still so fresh in her mind. <em>She wouldn’t want this to get in the way of my duties, she’d have told me to get out there and make the world a better place by now. She always was good at pep talks.</em> the memories of her mate encouraging her, of them encouraging one another, felt warm and fuzzy still— happier memories she’d keep with her until the end of time. Hollyfrost wouldn’t want her to feel so depressed, she’d want her to bask in the joy of the future she was going to create as leader of ThunderClan… In a way, maybe she was still watching over her and guiding her along.

<em>I’ll make her proud, I owe it to her.</em>

She may not remember her whole life but Icestar’s intelligence remained intact. They were talking about her. Devastation was clear on their faces and she couldn’t quite tell whether it was because of her or the scent of blood that choked at their lungs. Cries of grief and pain rang in the background. Something terrible had happened here and her chest flipped uncomfortably at the very knowledge that she couldn’t remember doing anything against it. A bond was tied to this group of cats somehow and she felt a fierce loyalty for them. <em>Is it because of my memory loss they were talking about?</em>

Marigolddust’s gentle words soothed her. <strong>” Okay,”</strong> she whispered out. <strong>” Is it because I can’t remember things I am supposed to?”</strong> Was all the agony in camp somehow tied to her memory loss? Did <em>she</em> cause it? Iceheart gulped uneasily and sank deeper into Bearmask’s fur. It was only a momentary panic.

There was an ungodly amount of bodies displayed around the camp in lifeless heaps.  Crimson blood soaked the grass bellow the medic&#39;s feet like red blood on a blank canvas, except the sight was far less beautiful.  It was horrifying, looking out in the large spanse of blood, death, and tears that covered the camp, making it seem almost as if all of the red would never wash away again, no matter how much rain battled it.  Marigolddust knew that they were going to give each and every one of these bodies a funeral in honor of their lives, besides those who had caused this mess in the first place.  They had to; it seemed like the least they could do.  

               Marigolddust couldn&#39;t help but feel sour, a moon that he wasn&#39;t very used to.  The taste of iron was stuck to his tounge, even though the only reason why it would be there was from grooming the injured for warmth or comfort.  Either that, or the thickness of the au stance in the air was enough to make him feel as if his throat was covered in it.  He felt as if he would never smell the fresh, welcoming air that he had walked out to just days ago again.  Everything just seemed so... <em>Destroyed</em>.  Even though he was a medicine cat and should have cared for all- which in most any case, he would have anyways- but at that moment, the moment where he looked out at all of the bodies including his sister, Tigerpaw and Hollyfrost, he could think of no good end for the traitors who had started this.  He didn&#39;t think they should have been exiled like they were going to be.  Wasn&#39;t this punishable by death?  What if they came back and brought this destruction again?  We&#39;re they the reason that Fernpaw had never made it home, back to him and the rest of the clan?</span>

              Placing a paw firmly on his tail, he brought himself back to focus.  These thoughts were all too violent, too unnatural for his brain.  So why were they there?  Why were they pestering him like this?  Slowely, he shook his head to himself, shameful, and made the decent from the highledge.  He padded through the bodies, weaving around them uncertainly, as he stared at each with wide-eyed, fearful grief.  All of these poor cats had never made it.  Could he have saved them?  Perhaps he could have prevented these deaths?  That was his job, wasn&#39;t it?  Carefully, as he passed each body, he checked to make sure they really had passed, hoping that he still had the chance of saving some of them.  <em>Any</em> of them.  Maybe then he wouldn&#39;t feel so ashamed of himself.

His soft gaze was slowly looking over her body as she spoke, wanting to make sure she really was not hurt or that she had not missed a wound or anything like that. Once he was satisfied, his eyes glanced at her face, almost not catching the question as he had been so focused on checking over her wound, before quickly shaking his head to gather himself. <strong>&quot;Oh, I&#39;m alright. Just a few scars and bite marks to add to the collection, but nothing that is very serious.&quot;</strong> He responded softly, knowing soon enough he was going to need to get his own wounds checked out and taken care of, but he wanted to make sure everyone else who was worse off got the care that they needed. <strong>&quot;Is there anything I can get you?&quot;</strong>

Her heart already weighed heavy inside her chest, and as the tom beside her gently nudged her for them to start leaving the den, she almost wished they had stayed inside. It was inescapable.....the death and destruction....and deep down she knew it was something that could not be helped, but she longed for the kits to not have to go through anymore of this brutality that they should not have to be witnessing at such a young age. A heavy sigh left her, doing her best to steer the kits away from the fallen and try to reunite them with their families....if any had survived. 

It was depressing to see, and she could only feel her heart sinking deeper as she grieved for those around her. Why did StarClan have to let this happen? Couldn&#39;t there have been someway for this to have been avoided? Tears pricked her eyes, and she closed them momentarily to try and keep herself from crying. Now was not the time...there were still others who were injured that needed their help. Her own body was unsteady as she limped along, wanting to help others even though blood was still dripping from her clawed side, while the rest of her injuries had mostly stopped bleeding due to being smaller cuts. But she did not want to stop moving...she didn&#39;t want to be able to think about all of this. It was stupid, she knew that, but maybe if she didn&#39;t stop moving then she wouldn&#39;t have to face the facts.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Bearmask’s ears twitched as he heard footsteps approach. He looked over, watching as his former apprentice, Cypressgaze, came padding towards him. Truth be told, it felt as if it had been moons since the last time they spoke. She was the first actual apprentice he ever took on, and she showed great promise in her time of training. Sure, she could still use some touching up in certain areas, but almost every warrior did. Bearmask hadn’t seen much of Cypressgaze during the battle, too focused on the endless horde of opponents he seemed to face and on finding Silentwing. He was glad to see that she was okay.

<strong>”Yeah. It does,”</strong> Bearmask nodded, glancing at the fresh-kill pile once more before turning his attention back to Cypressgaze’s injuries. Many warriors and apprentices had been injured during the battle, leaving the Clan relatively low on able-bodied individuals who could carry out the necessary tasks needed for their Clan to thrive. But if Cypressgaze was let out of the medicine cat’s den by Marigolddust already, her wounds must not have been nearly as bad as the others’. <strong>”Tag along if you don’t have anything better to do.”</strong>

Bearmask headed for the exit, indifferent as to whether his old apprentice would join him or not. It wasn’t as if he intended to look for company, but Cypressgaze was one of the few cats he could tolerate, so he figured he may as well invite her with him. Besides, more mouths brought more prey.

<em><strong><em>- Post Battle -</em></strong></em>

Of course it was a stupid question.  Marigolddust knew that, but what else was he supposed to say?  Hr couldn&#39;t come up with anything else, and he feared saying anything else would cause him to sound disrespectful or uninjured by what he was seeing in that moment.  It was either speak, or don&#39;t say a word, and Marigolddust felt that speaking was the best option, even if it hurt him to make any rhythmic patterns of sounds such as words.  He couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off of Lilachaze&#39;s, even after Wolfprowl had closed them.  He hardly even noticed when his only other living brother, and only other sibling in Thunderclan, joined the two.  At the sound of Astermoon&#39;s voice, Marigolddust&#39;s fur pricked and he stiffened, startled.  Casting a quick glance over to the marble-furred warrior, Marigolddust joined them both in silence.  

                    Perhaps they didn&#39;t know what to feel, either.  Maybe he didn&#39;t have to feel so guilty.  But, he did anyways.  He couldn&#39;t help it- the sister he had never paid much attention to was now laying there in front of his paws, as lifeless as Periwinklekit had been the day her illness became too strong for her.  The young medicine cat&#39;s  star-tipped ears swerved back, blanketing over the back of his skull as he recalled the bitter memory.  <em>Why?</em> He silently preyed, sparing a look up to the sky where the stars were now hidden.  <em>Why do you keep doing this?  Spare them!  They did nothing wrong!  Nothing...</em> His thoughts slowely became hushed as Astermoon began to speak, and he raised a paw to wipe away forming tears, examining his paw afterwords.  Had they been formed by confusion?  Shock?  Grief?  He couldn&#39;t even tell.</span>

                  Unlike his brothers, Marigolddust stayed away from the body.  He didn&#39;t want to touch it, not when he could have saved her by doing just that.  If he touched her bloodied fur now, it would only remind him that he could have prevented this.  It was his <em>job</em> to prevent this.  Yet he didn&#39;t.  He hadn&#39;t.  And he couldn&#39;t help but feel somehow, that this was his fault.  The grey tuxedo&#39;s muzzle wrinkled as he found himself choking back a sob.  Every on of Astermoon&#39;s words were correct, and he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about how he could have prevented this.  Raising a paw, he tried to cover up his mouth to hold back the emotions threatening to run loose.

The medicine cat found himself pausing at every body, checking each and every one for some sort of pulse or breathing.  All of them were as lifeless as they looked, and eventually, he ended up relying on his sight, hoping that the process would go faster if he did so.  Walking through the bodies carefully, Marigolddust tried not to imagine how each of them died.  Unfortunately, it was tricky, seeing all of the different, brutal wounds decorating each corpse.  How much had each cat suffered?  We&#39;re most of the deaths quick?  Who had landed all of these killing blows?  Had it been the traitors, the cats who had tried to bring the end to their own clan?  None of the injuries looked light or forgiving.  Clearly, no mercy was given to any of these victims, and blood painted each one red.  He could even make out the thick coating of blood on the darkest of fur, made present by so much previous bleeding.  And all of the blood was still wet, having been shed not long ago.  He had discovered this when he accidentally stepped foot into a puddle of the crimson substance, despite his attempts to dodge it.  

               Marigolddust paused at one body in particular.  This one seemed far more recent, and belonged to a she-cat who didn&#39;t look old at all.  There weren&#39;t nearly as many gashes or cuts along the warrioress&#39;s flank as some others that he had seen, but she looked just as lifeless.  It almost looked as if, had he been here an hour ago, he could have actually saved her.  Tears threatened to slip down his cheeks at the idea, and he quickly blinked them away.  He couldn&#39;t cry, not now.  He had to focus on finding survivors, not blurred his vision with the salty substance.</span>

                   For a moment, though, he could have sworn the grief was making him see things.  Intently, he kept his eyes on the fem&#39;s tail, looking for some sign of movement.  He could have sworn if had twitched a moment before, and just as he was about to conclude that he had been imagining it, it twitched again.  Golden hues widened as Marigolddust made the realization, and he quickly checked the cat&#39;s pulse.  She had a heart rate, and although it might not have been too steady, it was still present.  His heart skipped a beat as he quickly dropped his herbs, rushing to gather the right ones.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Ever since the battle, Bearmask not being closely accompanied by Iceheart was a rare sight. He spent a lot of his time showing her around, trying his best to get her to remember something of her past memories, but there was still unfortunately no such luck. Even now as he stood in camp, just outside the warriors den, he tried to think up of ways he could jog her memories more effectively. After being unable to think of anything, however, he simply decided to focus on performing some of his warrior activities. Maybe he would think of something while he was busying himself, but it was no good to stay idle for too long.

Had any other patrols been sent out yet? Just as he asked himself this, he spotted Laurelblaze in camp, most likely caught up in her own head too by the look of it. Bearmask made his way over to the she-cat. <strong>”Don’t stay in that head of yours for too long,”</strong> he said, coming to a stop a few mouse-lengths away from her. <strong>”It won’t do the Clan any good having an idle leader.“</strong>

ThunderClan needed to heal as soon as possible if it wanted to thrive these coming moons. After this attack, they were left almost completely defenseless. Warriors were still trying their best to lick their wounds with Marigolddust’s help, but in the meantime, those who were still able would be wise to do whatever they could to ensure the Clan quickly recovered. Bearmask had already been out hunting with Cypressgaze, but he had always an overachiever. He wouldn’t mind going on a second or even third round. Anything to keep his paws busy.

It was rare to see the deputy stewing over thoughts for so long, unless she was debating with herself over battle strategies for future use. Though her talk with Marigolddust had put some things in perspective, not every leader <em>wanted</em> to lead at first, but she had her clanmates&#39; support, whether she saw it or not. Still, part of her felt guilty about succeeding Icestar this way, part of her wished she had some form of confirmation that this was acceptable by her ancestors.

<em>But there&#39;s only one way for me to find out if it truly is, and that means traveling to the Moonpool.</em>

<em>I have to do it soon, I&#39;ll have to see Marigolddust when I am ready, but I have to oversee the clan for a little bit so I know they will be fine with me gone for a while.</em>

Taking a deep breath, the tortoiseshell&#39;s ears flickered when she picked up on the familiar voice of Bearmask approaching her. <strong>&quot;I&#39;d rather not be called that until I actually do go to the Moonpool, if I receive my lives I will let you know when it&#39;s fine to address me as leader... Right now, it&#39;s not the title I wish to be using when I am not sure if I can truly succeed Icestar, this is an odd case to say the least.&quot;</strong> her leader had given up all of her lives, and one of her souls, and lived, was it truly possible for her to succeed her without StarClan intervening? Nothing like this had ever happened in the history of the clans, at least, from what she knew. This was new territory, and it felt strange to be a part of it, of witnessing such a phenomenon. <strong>&quot;And you don&#39;t know what I may be thinking up in my mind when I am sitting here in camp, I do make it a habit to make plans for the day rather than fuddle with my paws for hours. I could be thinking of a grand defense plan for all you know.&quot;</strong> she was always quick to insist she was keeping herself busy. While she was known for being a cat who took action, she did have to spend some time planning instead of rushing head-first into something new.

Another day of rebuilding, and she was spearheading some repairs around the warriors’ den. Parts of the camp was worse for wear after the battle, though the dens had surely seen better days. Even if she was now the acting leader of ThunderClan, she still had to get involved in the matters of her clan and get her own paws dirty. She wasn’t going to order her clanmates around and do <em>nothing</em>. She hated being idle, Laurelblaze was always an active type.

The tortoiseshell she-cat hummed a bit as she weaved twigs and insulation into the roots of the fallen beech tree the warriors made their den out of… Her old den. Part of her felt nostalgic, though she’d been sleeping up in the Highledge’s den for the past few days. It was a strange change for her, but she had to admit the den was nice, it was certainly roomy. A little too roomy, it felt so empty without the presence of her clanmates around her— especially without Hollyfrost sharing a nest with her.

<em>Maybe I should ask the kits if they want to set up a nest in there for a while, maybe it’ll help them. I don’t know.</em>

She knew her kits were grieving the loss of their mother, and she felt much more of a loss when she was seeing how her kits were reacting to it. Laurelblaze wanted to ensure they were going to come out of this okay, that they would be able to recover well. Losing a parent so early in life was painful, and she knew it well. The one thing she wished wouldn’t occur to them had happened, just like it happened to her when she was a little older than they were— a fresh warrior.  <em>I have to be there for them, just like my father was there for me. They need to know they are never alone in this.</em>

But she knew everyone grieved in their own special ways, but she would nonetheless extend her offer to each and every one of them if they needed it. Her den was always open to her family. <em>But now’s not the time to worry about that, I need to make sure this den is repaired so my clanmates have a place to sleep. Even if I’m not sleeping in here, I can still repay this den for all the good nights sleep I had in it.</em>

Don’t underestimate her! She knew how important it was to ensure that the Clan thrived, no matter what. You should too.”</strong> No one understood her better than he did. Even when they had differences of opinions, Bearmask always understood Icestar’s reasoning, and, in turn, she always seemed to understand his.

Bearmask didn’t think there was any point in sending Icestar—no, Iceheart—to the medicine cat’s den, but he figured he should let Marigolddust do what he could before making any rash protests. <strong>”Come on,”</strong> he nudged Iceheart, signaling for her to follow Marigolddust to his den. <strong>”I’ll explain everything once your inside the den.”</strong> Afterwards, he figured he should help guard some of the traitors, lest they catch some of his Clanmates begin to slip.

Before departing, he gave one last look at the deputy, trying to determine just what would become of the Clan with her newfound leadership. Whether she liked it or not, she was going to call the shots now, and probably for a while. Bearmask knew he should trust Icestar’s decision, but part of him ever remained the cynic. He hadn’t interacted much with the she-cat before, so he couldn’t say if she was a decent cat or not. He just hoped, for ThunderClan’s sake, that she was competent enough to lead them into the fast-approaching future.

She made her own opinions all while staying loyal to her mate. True. An easily overlooked virtue. So what of it now? Laurels better half was deceased, and thence remained the unceremonious LaurelStar. It was saddening almost; the multicoloured warrioress had finally received her role at monarch, but the sidelines were short of one important individual. Unfulfilled pride. A piece uncollected, though this piece had gone to ashes, the puzzle will never be whole.
&#160; &#160; And rightfully so, the standing sachem had busied herself. It did not go unnoticed by the observative emeralds of this virile; watching whom he knew not to be too fond with in the past, but currently a tolerable presence, scurried from the warriors&#39; den to the leaders den. Each and every time he had walked in with a dead thing in maw. Though by the third time, his steps were not retraced back to the territories; they strayed elsewhere.</span>

She’d been carefully weaving another twig into the den’s walls, and when Alerceclaw had approached, she’d stopped while it was still halfway sticking out. <strong>”Oh, hey Alerceclaw.”</strong> she turned to face the large tom a bit, before gesturing to the rather ridiculous-looking stick she was working with. <strong>”Just let me finish up with this real quick? I’ll bother me if I leave it hanging out like that and not finishing the job.”</strong> she turned quickly turned back around, continuing to carefully push the twig back into the walls of the den, no longer sticking out where it could easily poke into someone. <strong>”There, you wanted to share a rabbit?”</strong> she faced the warrior yet again, staring at the rabbit he’s dropped to the ground. <strong>”I need to get a bite honestly, I still haven’t eaten today, but I wanted to get some work done before I did. Thanks.”</strong> she accepted the offer graciously, dipping her skull to her clanmate out of thanks. Better off going somewhere else in camp, however, blocking the entrance to the warrior’s den would be discourteous to the ones needing to go in or out. <strong>”Hmm, mind heading over to that little patch of sun there? It’ll be warmer than eating in the shade.”</strong> the cold weather was ever present now, she could see the grass in the forest frosting up in the morning— yet no snowfall. It would be upon them soon, and she had to make sure the camp was ship-shape for the season. They now had to reinforce the dens for leaf-bare, and had to double their efforts in catching prey for their stores. <em>With the cold weather, it’ll stay fresher for a little while longer, but we can’t be stuck eating stale prey every day.</em> the deputy stared at their fresh-kill pile, which was much smaller than it was when the landslide began— having occurred just before the start of leaf-fall. She had to make sure she kept the clan fed, <em>but I have to schedule more patrols, more of everything, so many duties at once.</em>

<em>UGH! I can’t keep putting off the Moonpool, I have to go there. I have to make sure everything is ready before I do, damn it…</em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Each day since the loss of his mother, yellow brandished the sky and illuminated the forest. At the end of his day, bold oranges melted into cool blues, and the moon rose. Around him the world continued to turn. It refused to stop so he could grieve, for he was not special.  Foxpaw struggled accepting this hard truth.

He, too, bore muddy paws. Hollyfrost’s mate and children carved out her final resting place together. He never wanted to experience it again - the moment reality struck him when the cold dirt met his claws. This was happening, Hollyfrost was <em>dead.</em> Nothing could restore the light in her lifeless eyes, or reanimate her stiff limbs. This was her finale. 

Foxpaw shared Astermoon’s grim expression. Grief brewed an unfamiliar, intense storm within him. Feelings he never knew he could feel struck him. 

No young cat should be imaging the rage induced scenes he was.

For the first time ever, the ThunderClan deputy would not be addressing herself as the second-in-command of her clan— but as the leader.

The first of many clan meetings she’d call upon the Highledge in her time as leader. This was strange, but a momentous occasion.

Yet she felt deeply disturbed by the context in which she was calling this meeting together. Today, it marked the day she would be casting out the traitors to her beloved clan— ones who had shed the blood of their clanmates, taken their lives. Part of her wished she’d just end their lives already for all the ones they had lost, but that wasn’t how things were <em>meant</em> to work. Public execution wasn’t the way, not for the clans, and as much as she <em>hated</em> them, and how they were so easily swayed to betray their clanmates, she knew she couldn’t do that. That was not the kind of leader she was going to be, she wasn’t going to wield her power to harm others without reason.

<em>They are leaving the clan without any allies, and no hope of return. That will be a fitting punishment enough.</em>

Still, that didn’t sate her boiling rage at the thought of them leaving without any further repercussions. 

Laurelblaze emerged from the den attached to the Highledge itself, taking a few steps out onto the rocky outcropping and staring down at the clearing below. She took a deep breath, before she finally called out to her clanmates, it was time to begin. <strong>”Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey gather beneath the Highledge for a clan meeting!”</strong> her deep voice rang out across the quarry as a signal for all her clanmates to congregate below, her gaze burning before she continued. <strong>”And bring every prisoner forward!”</strong> she cast her gaze towards the warriors she could see in camp currently, before she looked to the makeshift gathering place where they held their prisoners, for it was time for their judgement.

<em>I’m sick and tired of seeing them in my camp.</em>

She was humiliated, and utterly lost at the fact that they had failed. Silentwing and Frozenmink were dead, Deerbounce had abandoned them, what went wrong? They had done everything right, struck when the clan was weakest!

<em>The next time I see Deerbounce, I’ll kill her, she left us there! She deserted us when we needed her most!</em>

Being ushered into the clearing with warriors surrounding her, the tan tabby glared up at the Highledge with fire in her gaze, her fur bristling as she refused to appear beaten in front of these fools. Her head was held high, she wouldn’t accept defeat with shame, no matter how much hatred was being spewed her way. <em>Mark my words, they’ll see what they are missing, I will rise again. This is just another step, perhaps it is time I should cut this clan away, for now.</em>

Finchbriar sat there in silence, but her resolve was not ripped away from her. She was always the type to never give in to her enemies, even when she was beaten. <em>I’ll be back, and they’ll never take me alive.</em>

<em>I will destroy them all.</em></span>

The pale she cat knew that Laurelblaze would be exerting some sort of punishment on them. Regardless of the sins she committed, Wolfshine hoped that it wouldn’t be too severe. Carrying tiny lives inside her was no easy task. Whatever stressful event she was about to go through, she could do it with her head held high. Seeing the angry glare of the leader made her skin crawl. Laurelblaze has to know that she is still a good cat at heart, right?

Her clanmates would hate her, but there would come a time where they would understand why she did what she did. Bringing new lives into the world was always a great gift, no matter what clan they would grow up in.
Seeing Finchbriar’s scowl, Wolfshine wondered if she still hated Thunderclan so much. The senior warrior had decided to make amends with the whole situation, she had no issue serving her clan in the past. But in order to have a family, she had to listen to Silentwing. Any cat who wanted to be a mother would know that it was painful seeing other she-cats having kits. The queens were young, and happy. Even though she was a seasoned warrior, she needed that too.
Whatever happened, Wolfshine braced herself for some bad news. Whether it be she has her warrior status revoked, or she stayed prisoner forever.

The roar of her mother&#39;s call had lured the ombre tabby out of the medicine cats den. A furious screech to adress Thunderclan and the traitors, this would be the day that they&#39;d be exiled out of Thunderclan for good.

Green slits trailed down to the clearing and down onto the familiar pelts of the dark forest trainee&#39;s. The felines responsible working with Deerbounce and Silentwing to try and take the Clan down with all their ill intention, she couldn&#39;t understand why their motivation to tear down their only home was so driven to be completed — They failed...

Yet, Tigerpaws gaze was only focused on one of the specific traitors within the lined up clique — Finchbriar, who&#39;d been a hell figure throughout Tigerpaws apprenticeship. She felt so scared of the molly before and tried her hardest to live up to her expectations, feeling as if she couldn&#39;t turn to anyone because she thought it was the way that mentors treated their apprentices.

But now, Finchbriar had no control — And all of the fear had washed over like a huge tsunami.

She watched the pale tabby with a scowl furing her ears back and brows furrowing down, a blaze of anger spreading across her furrowed gaze like venom.   

<strong>&quot;I can&#39;t believe I ever thought good of you.&quot;</strong>  A pause as she leaned herself against the medicine dens wall, for support to rest her healing injuries.  <strong>&quot;You&#39;re a disgrace.&quot;</strong></span>

Defeat. A word and emotion she was familiar with, but not to this extent. She&#39;d done everything Silentwing and Deerbounce had asked of her, working alongside her comrades in destroying Thunderclan&#39;s chances of survival. Their downfall was supposed to be inevitable. And yet, the tables had turned and <em>she</em>, alongside her companions had been the ones to fall before them. Some had died...even Silentwing had been. It was an unfathomable thought to say the least, but she&#39;d seen it with her own two eyes. Something must&#39;ve gone wrong at some point...something had to have gone wrong. <em>This is nothing but a disgrace...failure was not among our destined path. Among <strong>my</strong> destined path.</em> And yet, she&#39;d been defeated.
    Nonetheless, she hadn&#39;t been taken down easily. Her claws bore the blood of various felines, including her late daughter&#39;s. Had it not been for that despicable tom, she&#39;d taken another life too, that horrid apprentice&#39;s. Maybe she had. She had no idea on the status of the young molly, but such didn&#39;t concern her at the moment. What concerned her was her future. What was supposed to happen now? She&#39;d sought after a greater purpose, a greater destiny. The lowly life of a warrior was unsatisfying, leaving her with a burning desire to seek something more. She&#39;d been promised this. And now, with the death of Silentwing she&#39;d never receive it. She&#39;d be without anything.
    But even with this in mind, even with the cry of Laurelblaze calling forth her clan and those deemed traitors - which she was among - Hollowgrove did not fail to seem unashamed. With her head raised, she strode toward her comrades with a confident stride, her gaze burning with the same nature. Violet eyes glared at those who gathered nearby, the hint of a sneer begging to make an appearance. <em>They can say and do whatever they please to me, I will not apologize for anything. What is done is done, no guilt rests among me.</em></span>

She still might be receiving her purpose after all.

He had been a good mentor, gentle and supportive, to the young tom, even while behind the scenes he&#39;d been plotting against their clan. The traitor didn&#39;t spare his apprentice a glance though. Whatever their gaze might share, it would only be painful.

He simply gathered his mate close to him with his tail and glared stonily up at the high ledge. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span> <span class="mention" title="AIMSIR#9490">@cobra</span></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Wounds bound the warrior to a nest that had his muscles stiff and his nose stuffy. There were so many smells from blood and herbs alike, so many sounds from cats crying to those gasping in relief when prognosis&#39; were revealed for their clanmates, the herbs suffocated his fur and his wounds made it painful to move. One good swing of his head and the deep lines on either side of his neck would reopen. One awkward twist of his spine and it would spell the same damage for those wounds along his flank. Moving was simply out of the equation for him. He had spent days in and out of consciousness, only ever awake long enough to take a few bites of food before the exhaustion pulled him under again.
Little details of the aftermath had been told to him, for Marigolddust was rather particular that his main goal was to recover, not fuel the nightmares that his overactive imagination was already a master at crafting.
As he blinked open his eyes, responsive to the familiar call of a particular she-cat, he found his unfocused eyes settling on a patched tabby instead from within the medicine cat den. It took a long few moments before he could comprehend Tigerpaws presence and even longer before he could call out to her.
Dustycloud closed his eyes, focusing on his own rise and fall of his chest before attempting to speak. <strong>&quot;W...Whats... going on?&quot;</strong> He asked, voice hoarse as he opened his eyes once more as though watching and talking was just too much at the moment. <span class="mention" title="Goosey !!!#8608">@goose</span></span>

Another strange feeling came over her, she wasn’t used to being up this high near a cliff’s edge. She’d climbed the steps before countless times to go into the den to give reports, but never had she stood so close to the edge of the Highledge. For a moment, she thought she was going to fall over the edge, it was jarring being up here rather than down below. 

As her clanmates gathered in the clearing below, Laurelblaze was watching the soon-to-be exiled traitors being grouped together, and she observed the various expressions and reactions of the various cats she could see from this height. Mixtures of malice and disappointment, the exchange of whispers into each other’s ears, even dismay. These cats had helped cause chaos within these walls, and brought harm to their clanmates, resulting in the deaths of three honorable warriors. No matter how they begged, or how they pleaded, she would not be swayed from her decision. They broke one of the most important virtues they upheld in ThunderClan— loyalty to the clan.

Yet just beforehand, she had to make the announcement that would give her the proper authority to banish them. To remind them that she would be there to protect her clanmates from them if they dared to show their faces again. On a lighter note, it was also to elucidate the clan on their future, of her leadership. <strong>”I gathered everyone here today to give you all an important update on the state of leadership within the clan. As I’m sure you all are aware that Icestar has lost her memories, no longer answering to the name bestowed upon her when she became leader, but her warrior name instead… She has still not  recovered her memories, and much as I do not wish to say it… Leaves me to succeed her.”</strong>

She took a deep breath, she had essentially stated Icestar was no longer fit to lead, and she <em>hated</em> it.

<strong>”I will go to the Moonpool in the near future to receive my nine lives from StarClan, and as for a deputy, I do not have anyone picked yet, but I will be looking out to select my successor.  Right now, that is not the issue at hand.”</strong>

Her gaze was directly cast in the vicinity of the traitors, staring each of them down with anger and betrayal in her gaze. These cats were once her clanmates, cats she once shared fresh-kill with. Cats she <em>trusted</em>, two of which mentored her own kits. It was time for her to give them their sentencing, her first true act as leader.

<strong>”Finchbriar, Hollowgrove, Needlestripe, and Wolfshine. Your actions during the battle were heinous and directly broke the very first rule established by the Warrior Code— Your loyalty must remain to your clan. Instead, you colluded with cats from the Dark Forest, and have been found guilty of treason to ThunderClan, and are responsible, directly or not, for the deaths of four honorable warriors of ThunderClan.”</strong>

Her gaze narrowed, and she bore her fangs down at them, her fur bristling as she shared in the collective anger her clanmates were experiencing by their very presence in camp.

<strong>”I hereby exile every single one of you from ThunderClan, you will no longer be recognized as any of our warriors, nor seen as clanmates. I order every and all warriors of ThunderClan, if you see any of these traitors encroaching upon our lands, you will attack them on sight, and I permit the use of deadly force if necessary. We will not show mercy to the ones who have betrayed our clan.”</strong>

As Needlestripe padded up to her side , she felt warmth spread through her. Regardless of what they had been through, they could face anything together. He was the father of her kits, her mate and her everything. She could spend an eternity of punishment of pain, and she would never regret her actions.
She leaned into him, and braced herself.

<em>Exile?</em>
Panic flared though her like a growing fire. What about her kits? She can’t give birth to them all alone! They would grow up as rogues! She looked around, her eyes wide in fear.
She quickly sprinted up to the front of the group, and took one last look at Needlestripe. She had hoped to tell him at a better time, but now she had no choice.
<strong>” Wait! No please don’t exile me! I’m sorry! I’m so sorry for what I’ve done! Please don’t send me away. I’m… I’m expecting kits!”</strong>

The tan tabby’s gaze widened as she heard her punishment, <em>exile</em>. She would no longer be sharing the same den with her former clanmates, no longer recognized as a warrior of ThunderClan.

<em>Unbound by the Code.</em>

A part of her felt relief, she would have her life, she would live to see another day. This clan did not scare her, she hardly felt fear around them, they were just obstacles in her way, and one day they would see that they made a grave error in their treatment of her as well as her family. She’d make them suffer for it.

She stood up, shaking out her pelt in silence. She turned to look at the crowd one last time, as well as her former perpetrators, and lightly smirked. <strong>”Guess your wish really bit you in the rear, huh.”</strong> she scoffed at Wolfshine and Needlestripe’s dramatic display, before she began to walk away.

No one would hold her back, ever again. Not a code, not some dead cats in the night sky, she was <em>free</em>.</span>

The sudden hoarse gasp alerted the tabbies instincts and shot her gaze over her shoulder and perked an ear up. Alarm as the furs on her shoulders prickled at the unexpected voice behind, yet Tigerpaw was quick to take a breath once she saw her older brother recovering from a long sleep of rest. A small smile appeared on her muzzle, perhaps she had been caught up in the exile that any subtle sound or gesture could scare her. Yet, the smile drooped off of her face, vanishing as quickly as it had appeared on her features when she had to explain the situation.

<strong>&quot;Mom&#39;s rounding up the remaining traitors and exiling them.&quot;</strong>  A grunt cuffed through Tigerpaw as she picked herself back up to her balance to fully face the dusty-tabby with her stance, the crimson slitting wound on her shoulder striking a harsh jab down her leg. Yet she was quick to lean herself against the wall for brief support, before she regained balance on three paws and began to limp closer to where her brother lay.  <strong>&quot;Finchbriars... Finally gone.&quot;</strong>  A sigh.  <strong>&quot;For good.&quot;</strong> <span class="mention" title="Jay said &quot;MATERIAL GWORL&quot;#0677">@Jay said &quot;MATERIAL GWORL&quot;</span></span>

Exile. The words were spilled by the soon-to-be leader without hesitation, filled with hatred and disgust. Various gazes around her held similar emotions, perhaps alongside that of fear while others, relief. Her whiskers quivered slightly, yet she made no attempt to speak, instead merely shrugging her shoulders. She wouldn&#39;t be one to beg for mercy, they would deem her undeserving of such and quite frankly, she didn&#39;t want such a thing bestowed upon her, even if she had the chance to receive such. It would only be a matter of time before the clan would collapse upon itself anyway...so, with that in mind, perhaps she was receiving mercy. A headstart on escaping this dreaded place before its demise.
    As violet eyes rolled in boredom, her attention was caught but the sudden outburst of Wolfshine. She was having kits? Needlestripe seemed just as surprised as a few others, though all that remained on Hollowgrove&#39;s face was indifference. <strong>&quot;Tsk tsk. Perhaps you should&#39;ve weighed your options beforehand. Well, it won&#39;t be too bad if they die...if such a fate doesn&#39;t meet you first.&quot;</strong> her words were more directed at Wolfshine, but Needlestripe as well. Kits...how embarrassing for <em>that</em> to be what she desired. <em>They&#39;ll end up merely as burdens...I should know.</em>
    Now, she fell silent and looked on with a bored gaze as stunned silence fell before them. There was no need to waste anymore time merely idling about...it was time to get out of this wretched place. And so, with a flash of a grin toward the two newfound parents, Hollowgrove trotted away in the direction Finchbriar had. Onward to a greater purpose.</span>

The last time he&#39;d seen her was draped over Hollyfrosts body. He had half expected to bleed out that day, shame creeping along his spine at the thought of leaving yet another body for his mother to mention upon the High Ledge. His amber and blue gaze averted to the ground, fighting harder than she should need to in an attempt at concentrating on the words spoken to him. <em>Exile.</em> He supposed that would be a punishment fit for the crime. Don&#39;t commit to the loyalty of the clan, then you don&#39;t receive the protection of the clan. Simple as that. So why didn&#39;t he feel any sort of victory? Why didn&#39;t he feel safe? Why didn&#39;t this feel <em>over</em>? 
<strong>&quot;Good.&quot;</strong> Dustycloud mumbled, gaze raising back up to trace the long wound along her arm. <strong>&quot;Are you alright?&quot;</strong> He inquired quietly, despite the painfully obvious fact that he was not in any shape to worry about anyone else. <span class="mention" title="Goosey !!!#8608">@goose</span></span>

As her clan reeled from the announcement she was making, the looks of fear upon the traitors faces was telling. They hadn’t expected this, but it was the only punishment befitting of a traitor— besides death, of course. Laurelblaze’s expression returned to that of a steely, cold one, unmoved by their looks of desperation and terror. Wolfshine’s cries had caught her attention, and she signaled for her clanmates to quiet down with a swish of her tail and a quick bark of <strong>”Silence!”</strong>

She glared down at the pregnant queen, addressing her personally.

<strong>”Given your condition, I will permit you to stay within the clan’s walls until your kits are born, but your punishment still stands, that’s it. Upon their birth, you will give up your rights as their mother, for they are innocent of your crimes. I will not allow innocent kits of ThunderClan to have their minds poisoned by the words of a traitor.”</strong>

It was a cruel punishment, but it reinforced her position on the matter. Traitors were not to be tolerated within her clan, and if she had to stoop to that level to ensure no one else had the bright idea of turning against their clan, against the code, she would. Laurelblaze had a clan to protect, including those who were innocent of the crimes their parents committed.

<strong>”As far as I am concerned, you gave up your rights as their mother the moment you decided to betray your clan. How could I, in a good conscience, leave kits to be raised by a cat willing to betray her own clan?”</strong>

She’d ensure those kits were protected, they were to be treated like her clanmates, no matter who their parents were. They had no influence over their actions, and they deserved her mercy. Laurelblaze refused to let their reputations be defined by their kin, she was done with that, and wouldn’t tolerate such behavior within the clan. <em>I will not allow such treatment to occur as leader, no one is born evil or wicked.</em>

<strong>”Everyone else who is set to be exiled is to leave now, or I will order the warriors to rip you to shreds right here and now.”</strong>

This was setting an example, she was done giving second chances to cats who did not deserve her mercy.

The pale she cat widened her eyes in horror at the statement. Not only would these kits be stripped from her, Needlestripe would have to leave too?
Warriors began to trot towards her, pushing her away from Needlestripe. Would she ever even see him again? She had to fight for him! She had to be a mother to her children!
<strong>” Laurelblaze please! Please don’t take my babies from me!”</strong>
It was too late, she was being carted away. She was in no condition to fight. She could not win no matter how hard she tried.
<strong>” Needlestripe! I love you! I’ll find you again one day! Your children will know your  name! I love you more than anything!”</strong>
She didn’t hear his response. She would never hear it. Finally being pushed away from the clearing, she collapsed. This was a fate worse than death.

He glared up at Laurelblaze with golden fire. <strong>&quot;Ready to tear apart another family, are you ThunderClan?!&quot;</strong> His voice echoed through the clearing. He turned, ready to stalk away. <strong>&quot;Tch. It&#39;s what you&#39;re good at.&quot;</strong>

He stretched his neck towards Wolfshine to give her a nuzzle goodbye but it was too late. Warriors were already creating a wall between them. <strong>&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I love you,&quot;</strong> he said back to her softly. He wasn&#39;t going to leave without giving the clan something to think about.

He had betrayed ThunderClan because of all the destroyed kinship, and now it was happening to him. Icestar was gone, but it seemed Laurelblaze was no different.

Seething and hurt, the silver tabby walked out of camp. <span class="mention" title="StarkTheWolf#5009">@Stark✨</span> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

<strong>&quot;No.&quot;</strong>  Had it been the heat of the moment and Finchbriars betreyal that angered the flaming-tabby apprentice to a full extent, in response for her voice of tone to sound so harsh and straightforward - yet thrilling a sadenned somber at the same time when replying to her brothers question full of concern. She darted her head away from his gaze, claws stretching out and scraping against the smooth grounds of the medicine den — Her singular ear falling against her cranium as she shook her head, dissapointment and resentfulness drowned the mollies guts.  

<strong>&quot;Everything I did for Finchbriar was to make her love and appreciate me for once, but now she turns on us and works with the dark forest to tear us off one by one?!&quot;</strong>  The tip of her striped tail lashed, refusing to turn back and meet Dustyclouds multicolored gaze.  <strong>&quot;I guess Thunderclan was never enough for her.&quot;</strong>  She huffed.  <strong>&quot;I guess <em>I</em> was never enough for her.&quot;</strong></span>

Justice had been served, and she watched as Needlestripe was forced to flee from their camp as Wolfshine was taken back to her imprisonment, this was a grim reminder of how much treason can shake a clan. She never <em>wanted</em> to take this course of action, but they had forced her hand. Perhaps it would have been better if Wolfshine kept her mouth shut about her kits, but she felt better knowing they would be safe within the walls of the clan. She’ll ensure they receive love and attention from a family who does deserve them. 

For these cats had already torn her own family apart by bringing their Dark Forest leaders here, this was an eye for an eye.

She watched as her clanmates finally settled back down after the excitement, her form relaxing as she observed them all with a gentle smile. <strong>”I should have mentioned this earlier, but I wanted to tell you all how proud I am to be serving you as leader of ThunderClan. It is because of your hard work and dedication to our clan that we have survived the battle, and will continue to survive no matter what obstacles are thrown in our path.”</strong> these were the cats she could trust, loyal, precious members of her clan. They had fought, tooth and nail, to protect each other, to defend their better future. She couldn’t express the amount of gratitude that was coming from deep within her soul at that very moment for them. <strong>”You all have proven that you are capable, phenomenal warriors. If our comrades who we lost are watching over us currently, I’m sure they’re looking down upon each and every one of you with utter pride. You all deserve to hear this.”</strong>

She let out a small sigh as she felt her wounded heart ache for the presence of not only her beloved mate, but for each of the cats she would not be seeing again, not until she herself joined the ranks of StarClan. Tigerspring hurt especially for her, she was just a new warrior, her own apprentice, lost in her first battle as a warrior, when she had so much potential ahead of her. It was unfair, but she was still proud of everything she had achieved, her sacrifice ensured they lived another day, and she would carry on her legacy with all her apprentices from now on. <strong>”I want to memorialize the ones we lost in this meeting, giving them the respect they deserve for the ultimate sacrifices they had made in defense of their clan. They upheld the Warrior Code until their final breath, and deserve to be recognized for their actions. They are all heroes, and we will honor their memory with every action we take as a clan. Hollyfrost, Tigerspring, Gracklequiver, and Lilachaze, they will each be remembered with pride.”</strong>

<strong>”That will be all, ThunderClan.”</strong></span>

He&#39;d knocked at deaths door once and he wasnt too keen on winding up on those steps again on such short notice. His ears flicked backwards for a brief moment at her answer. <em>Ofcourse she&#39;s not. That was a stupid question to ask! Her mother was killed and her mentor is being exiled and deemed a traitor! She&#39;s been to war at the age of- what? 9 moons? 10?</em> Great Starclan he didnt even remember how old she was.
If he had had anymore tears to shed he would have just then, as the painful realization began to settle in. A stranger to his own siblings, the young cats who now <em>needed</em> an older brother yet he felt just as woefully unprepared and unqualified as the day they were brought to camp.
He didnt answer, even as she continued on to fill the silence. He blinked harshly as her tail lashed. There were another long few moments, watching her glare at any spot that didnt hold him in it. <strong>&quot;Im sorry.&quot;</strong> He mumbled, his hears having dropped already. <strong>&quot;Im sorry. And y-you shouldnt think like that.&quot;</strong> He meowed, brows pinched and up turned slightly. He looked rather concerned for speaking such words about herself, <strong>&quot;Its not your fault.&quot;</strong> <span class="mention" title="Goosey !!!#8608">@goose</span></span>

Her ear twitched as she waited for an answer but then the tom finally spoke. <strong>”Well that’s good,”</strong> she responded. His wounds definitely didn’t seem serious. She had to get herself checked out soon though, as wounds can get infected, but she decided to wait it out a bit and let other cats who have more serious wounds. 
Willow zoned out into her thoughts for a few seconds before Lionfur spoke. <strong>”Oh no no I don’t need anything,”</strong> she mewed. <strong>“-for now.”</strong> Willow jokingly added, but she appreciated his concern.

Marigolddust wasn&#39;t quite sure what was wrong with Rainsplash.  Of course there was <em>something</em>- otherwise she wouldn&#39;t be all bloodied and passed out.  Although, was she really passed out?  Was she already asleep, or did he still have a chance of keeping her awake?  What would he have to do?  As he tried to recall all he could about keeping a patient awake, he quickly went through the small bunch of herbs he had gathered.  By now he was fairly aware of each, being able to tell their name after a moment of thought, although the uses of the newer herbs could still be lost on him at times, especially times such as now.  From what he could recall, he didn&#39;t remember any of them being useful for keeping a patient awake and aware of their surroundings.  The only herbs he knew were ones that were meant to help with sleeping, and that was the last thing he needed.  It took him longer than he would have liked to figure out the best course of action, but once he had picked up a wet moss all to begin on the bleeding wounds, it came to him.  The water held in the small, spindly leaves was fairly cold, affected by the changing temperatures of the world outside of his den.  

                 Suddenly, an idea came to him.  He was never able to sleep when it was chilly (which would likely pose a problem, considering the fact that Leaf-bare was only getting closer), and because of this, perhaps the same would be true for the fem in front of him.  Picking up another mpssball, he transfered some of the water from the second to the first, wanting it to last long enough for him to work on the warrioress&#39;s wounds.</span>

                Carefully setting the ball of cold, wet moss onto the side of Rainsplash&#39;s head and letting the chilly water keep her mind vivid, he began working on her physical wounds with the rest of his stock.  The first wound he worked on was a gash on the back of the she-cat&#39;s head, patting it gently with the moss to stop the bleeding.  Marigolddust suspected that the wound was what caused her to black out, and it didn&#39;t look like something he could just brush off.  What would happen if <em>he</em> received that energy?  Would he pass out like Rainsplash, or would he be able to make it or not?  He tried to guess Rainsplash&#39;s situation as he imagined how his own body would react, but whether his guesses were accurate or not, he had no idea.  Quickly, he snatched up some marigold petals and began to chew them into a poulice, carefully beginning to spread the paste over his clanmate&#39;s wounds, hoping he wasn&#39;t already too late.

Her pelt was already blood covered, and the cold water wasent helping even a bit. <em>At this point I&#39;m going to freeze to death before I can move again.</em>  She could almost taste Marigolddusts  anxiousness. <em>I wonder why hes so worried..</em> She thought through the possibilites. <em>I dont think anything too bad happened.</em> she declared. 
 
Her bones where aching less now, probably a sign of her soon to come awakening. She could barley feel her tail-tip at this point because it was so cold. <em>Why is it so cold? Warm the water up!</em> <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

<em><strong><em>- Post Battle -</em></strong></em>

As the sound of Wolfprowl&#39;s suggestion met Marigolddust&#39;s ear, the medicine cat quickly raised a single moon-dipped paw up to his eyes, wiping away what years had begun to gather.  He stepped roughly on his tail, trying to bring himself back to attention so he could focus on getting everything ready for the burials.  Unfortunately, the action only made his eyes water harder.  Unwilling to let his voice break the weak wall keeping his tears from falling, he nodded instead, turning to gather up the necessary herbs.  Of course he knew what they were and where they were- it was his job, now, anyhow, even if he was still just getting started on learning.  He had recently become familiar with lavender and vigil, even if both had been only vogue topics in Beanspark&#39;s lesson.  The Skyclanner was back home now, but Marigolddust was still growing more and more familiar with the two herbs.  With so many passed cats and bodies to bury, it shouldn&#39;t have come as such a surprise to him.  It was a bit painful, learning things like this in such a difficult, hard situation.

                  Marigolddust cast Astermoon a quick glance with a grateful look behind his eyes, the look itself offering his brother a thanks, despite the fact that he wasn&#39;t exactly assisting Marigolddust as much as he was paying their lost sister a final favor.  Slowely, the young tuxedo followed his brother into his den, and once they had entered the familiar place, Marigolddust began his search for his lavender and vigil.  He didn&#39;t have much of either, needing to use both for more burials than he had ever expected to experience, let alone so early on in his time with the rank, but he managed to find enough eventually.  Gathering up the necessary herbs, he left his den and returned to Wolfprowl&#39;s side with the plants, forcing his eyes not to stray on Lilachaze too long.

Marigolddust couldn&#39;t help but stiffen when Rainsplash&#39;s flank vibrated with a shiver, revealing that the water was a bit too cold.  For a moment, he almost took the mossball away, not wanting her to be in too much discomfort while he worked on her injuries.  Unfortunately, he knew that she was <em>supposed</em> to be uncomfortable.  Otherwise, she might drift off to sleep, and of she did, she might never wake up again.  Or, at least, wake up to nothing but star-vielded cats.  So, although he wanted to take the moss off for awhile, he left it there, hoping to see more movement from the unconscious cat.  The tail twitch was a good sign, and the shivering even better.  Maybe if he let the cold soak into her fur a little bit longer, she might just wake.  If not, then hopefully she would come to reality when the mossball warmed with Rainsplash&#39;s natural body temperature.  It definitely wouldn&#39;t get any colder than it was already, buy if he really had to, he might replace it and therefore replace the chill, whether he wanted to or not.</span>

               Turning his focus away from the mossball and Rainsplash&#39;s reaction, Marigolddust finished spreading the marigold petals paste over her wounds.  Once he had completed the job, he carefully wiped the poulice off of his paws and onto the grass below.  He didn&#39;t want to waste it, but he couldn&#39;t exactly save it like he wanted to.  It would likely just go bad, plus, being unused to things like this, he couldn&#39;t help but feel it was a bit disgusting.  Just the taste of the petals tasted unnecessarily gross.  With a shake of his head, he showered off the thought.  Carefully picking up a bundle of spiderwebs, he began to spread the thin strands over Rainsplash&#39;s injuries, covering over the marigold poulice along with the injuries themselves, making it so the cobwebs covered the wounds in a net to keep it clean and keep the paste stuck, unable to be brushed off by the nature around the camp.  Hesitantly, he stepped back, double checking to make sure he had all of the gashes and cuts patched up.  Once he was sure he had, he reluctantly nudged Rainsplash&#39;s shoulder, checking one final time to see if she was ready to wake.  When she was, he would have to recommend being careful when resting and not leaving camp without a companion, just Incase some damage was done to her head.

 Again, she shivered. <em>Its so cold...</em> She could almost feel her nose turning blue, the coldness niping at her nose like a tasty mouse. She could finnaly almost move her limbs, the feeling of tiredness amd stones on her slowly lifting away like a bird to the sky.

 <em>I wonder how long it will take...</em> she struggled against sleep, and the cold helped her cling to awakeness. She barley twitched her nose, and she could move her ears, amd she twitched them and her paws were finnaly coming as round too. <em>Thank you StarClan. Thank you marigolddust.</em> she whispered the prays in her mind.

Movement.  More an more movement followed one after another; first the nose, then her ears, and finally her paws.  Excitement jumped up in the young tom&#39;s chest as he watched, overjoyed that he might have actually been able to save the cat, despite the fact that she had seemed as if she might have already been lost.  Perhaps if he could succeed in this, he would have more of a chance with everyone else.  Maybe then he would be more experienced, more deserving of the title as the clan&#39;s medicine cat.  Then, perhaps, he might be a little bit of a better healer, a more reliable medic to all of his clanmates.  Quickly, Marigolddust edged a bit closer to his clanmate, offering her shoulder another soft nudge before pausing a moment, trying to decide the best course of action.  He could try and groom her fur the opposite way, giving her warmth that might made it easier to move.  No, it would just make it more difficult for her to stay awake.  Maybe he should try to communicate with her, to see if she could open her eyes or speak at all.  Or should he wait?  Should he try and be more patient and see if she would come back on her own?  But what if she couldn&#39;t?  Subconsciously, he made the decision.</span>

                   <em><strong><em>&quot;H..hello?  Can you hear me?  Can you open your eyes?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, hesitant and uncertain as he spoke the questions.  He would take a perk of her ears as an answer to the first question, or the action of opening or keeping her eyes closed as an answer to the second.  He didn&#39;t exactly expect her to be able to speak, not if she had received brain damage from whatever had caused the gash in the back of her head, but he had hopes that she might be able to register his words.  He couldn&#39;t tell of she was too groggy and had been in a deep sleep, or whether she had just been paralyzed.  No, not paralyzed... She couldn&#39;t have been moving as much as she was if she had lost her control of her nerves.  He didn&#39;t want to make a move out of impatience and effect the she-cat negatively, and so he sat back and waited, trying to see if he could get a response of any sort.  Anything would work, and any increased movement would be a relief, even if it was something aggressive.

It felt like an electric shock, and she felt.. <em>Alive.</em> She slowly opened her eyes, the sun burning her eyes. &quot;M-marigolddust?&quot; She said slowly. She couldent seem to speak any faster, even though her brain was racing. Also, her voice was terribly quiet. <em>Did it damage my vocal cords?</em> She began to panic, and her face grew pale. But the sight of her clanmate helped soothe her. But she had a terrible headache, and it hurt almost as bad as when she had hit her head on that terrible rock.

&quot;Is... it ober?&quot; She fumbled around the words, her ears ringing and her head throbbing made it hard to think and speak. She still felt like stones were piled onto her pelt, and she decided to stay still instead of moving.</span>

The prey was slow coming back after the traitors had chased them off, not to mention leaf bare on the cusp.

Rednight gives a slight nod to what Wolfprowl says about needing to burry the prey in the kill pile soon due to leaf bare coming up. He didn&#39;t like leaf bare all that much since he did find it nice to get distracted by hunting but there was nothing he could do about the seasons changing.

Rednight didn&#39;t seemed too bothered by the cool breeze but decided to walk over and join Wolfprowl. <strong>&quot;The reason Windclanners don&#39;t freeze is because most cats that are in the clan have rather thick and long fur to keep them warm. It&#39;s just like how most cats in Riverclan have sleek and oily fur to keep the water from soaking into their fur.&quot;</strong> He says as he had well knowledge of the strengths of the other clans, the same for Thunderclan has warriors who are mostly skilled in being fast and some able to climb trees to catch their prey.

Rednight nods as he himself didn&#39;t know the cats that well but what they did went against everything they swore to uphold and protect when becoming warriors in Thunderclan. <strong>&quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be able to survive if they&#39;re all separated along with most likely none of the other clans will take them in.&quot;</strong> He says as he lays down on the ground and curls tail around himself.

<strong>&quot;That&#39;s one thing that most of the cats here fear is that they&#39;ll regroup and attack again.&quot;</strong> Rednight says as his fur prickles a bit at the thought of that happening because they had already killed three of the greatest cats Thunderclan ever had.

The black and white shecat didnt often socialize- the opposite of her father Panicflare who was quite gregarious. Night hunts were her common way to unwind and get away. Carrying two voles back into camp the shecat found herself met with the camps current guard. 

She paused for a moment heart pounding in her throat as she noted his body language. The shecat quickly dropped the voles<strong>”… everything okay, Wolfprowl?”</strong> she enquired with a quivering voice, wondering if they were facing a new danger of if she had displeased him.

Worry dotted the short shecats green gaze. Speckledivy&#39;s lip trembled a little as she forced forward a soft chuckle. <strong>&quot; I- I should hope not.&quot;</strong> The thought was pretty gruesome. She preferred her throat placed exactly where it was, right on her fluffy neck. <strong>&quot; Can I ask why you seem so... tense?&quot;</strong> The trouble had past had it not?- the she cat  wasn&#39;t one for trying to linger on traumatic past. The event was horrible enough. 

Her brow furrowed in a worried look- she hoped she wouldn&#39;t offend him. <strong>&quot; I mean no offence- you&#39;re doing a good job. I&#39;m just curious.&quot;</strong> Her head tipped to the side like a curious owl.

His ears flattened a second later. <strong>&quot;Save the sweet talk,&quot;</strong> he mumbled. <strong>&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be out alone at night.&quot;</strong> Did she not remember the mysterious bodies they&#39;d found around the territory?

She remembered- she had just chosen not to think about it. The she cat flinched at little at his dialog. He wasnt wrong. <strong>&quot; Who am I supposed to exit camp with?&quot;</strong> She enquired in a quiet a tone. <strong>&quot; Its quiet at night, I can think and focus- and I was safe. I didnt go far...&quot;</strong> 

She wasnt an apprentice- she was a warrior- though not the size of one.

The she-cat was confused- she couldn’t read the tom. Was he offering to come with her on her next hunt. Her heart hammered in her chest with anxiety. <strong>” Well… I was gonna go out tomorrow night as well. Would you like to come with me.”</strong> she slipped past him her eyes averted from him.

It was time.

She no longer could wait anymore, it was time for her to begin her journey to the Moonpool. Laurelblaze could feel herself growing more tense the longer she stood out in camp, trying to muster the courage to even step close to the pool. She’d never been to it before, only knowing the general area of where it was. She didn’t have a reason to go there, not until now. <em>Breathe, it’s gonna be okay.</em>

She never felt so nervous in her life. This was monumental, one of the most sacred ceremonies of the clans, where so few ever experienced it. Laurelblaze would be receiving her nine lives, this would be the last time her clanmates would ever be calling her by her warrior name. <em>And I’m gonna have to get used to introducing myself again… Damn.</em> she took another deep breath as she stared up at the slowly darkening skies. Soon Silverpelt would be exposed to all who could witness its glory, and she’d be convening with the stars amongst its band. <em>Who will I meet? Who will want to see me?</em>

<em>I can’t overthink this, I have to be brave. I have to lead my clan now, its up to me.</em>

She stood in camp, awaiting her friend to accompany her, the new leader was thankful she wasn’t going to be alone for this. Marigolddust was going to stand beside her through it all, and she had nothing to worry about. <em>I’m gonna do this, now or never.</em>

The shecat twirled herself around in circles like a fox readying its nest before she finally laydown with her legs neatly tucked underneath her fluff. Speckledivys eyes moved over toward Wolfprowl once more still curious of the tom. She resigned her curiosity and shifted her eye lids closed. The soft warm rays of the sun painted the inside of her eyelids a radish hue, like light shining behind the flesh of another cats ear. This was amusing and concerning- the sheepish shecat was far to away to nap.

<em><strong><em>• Present •</em></strong></em>

For some reason, Marigolddust never thought the day would come where Laurelblaze became Laurelblaze, let alone <em>him</em> accompanying her there.  Although she seemed the most worthy cat Marigolddust could think of for the position, the idea made him feel nauseated, and it wasn&#39;t from the clan&#39;s sickness.  The young medicine cat wasn&#39;t very welcoming to change, and it always made him feel more fearful than he was usually.  Now was such a situation, even after all of the change he had had to go through in the past moon.  But, for once, he wasn&#39;t so scared that this change would end in disaster.  No cat was dying because Laurelblaze was becoming the leader- Icestar- Ice<em>heart</em>, was very much still alive, even if she didn&#39;t have her memories anymore.  Now, Marigolddust was finishing up in his den, checking up on the last of his patients before he left the vine-veiled enterance, ready to start his search for the soon-to-be leader.  He didn&#39;t have to search long as his eyes landed on the hulking tortoiseshell form.  

                  As he approached his friend, he offered her a soft smile.  He could tell she was a little nervous, more nervous than he was at the idea of being in the presence of Starclan again.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Hey, Laurelblaze.  Are you ready?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, his voice hushed out of reflex.  He didn&#39;t want to wake too many cats, anyhow- not that he would have speaking normally.  But, perhaps he wanted to speak quietly so that it was easier for Laurelblaze to relax.  If he were to be completely honest, he couldn&#39;t help but hear his words as a reflection of those that Icestar had said to him before she had taken him to the Moonpool for the first time.  Now he was going there again, except <em>he</em> was the escort.</span>

                 It was an odd idea, and one he wasn&#39;t completely sure he was comfortable with.  It was far from his normal, to say the least, but his &#39;normal&#39; had become quite skewed recently.  Hopefully he would be better at this than he expected he would be, at least good enough to keep himself from ruining everything for Laurelblaze.  All he had to do was watch, right?  Make sure everything was going well?  That seemed easy enough, didn&#39;t it?  Perhaps he would be alright if he wasn&#39;t the focus this time.  Comforting was much easier than needing comfort, anyhow.

Laurelblaze had been putting on a brave face, but she couldn&#39;t help but to crack when Marigolddust asked her if she was ready. Letting out a groan, she reluctantly nodded, murmuring: <strong>&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be but I don&#39;t exactly have a choice in the matter. Let&#39;s get going and get it over with.&quot;</strong> she shook her head as she peered back up at him, having nearly thrown her head to the ground when she let out that dramatic exhale. She was being a big baby about it, or at least she suspected that would be what Hollyfrost would be saying to her right about now, probably looking down at her and laughing at how silly she was acting. This was supposed to be a joyous occasion for their clan. The ascension of a new leader to the Highledge was upon them.

Taking a deep breath, the tortoiseshell stood up tall, looking to the camp entrance with a fiery gaze. <strong>&quot;Alright, alright, no more fooling around. We have to go now.&quot;</strong> she swatted herself with her tail for a moment, forcing herself to take the necessary steps towards the tunnel leading out of camp. Luckily for her sake, in the repairs to camp they had made adjustments to the size of the tunnel. She no longer had to crawl through it, now she could walk in and out as she pleased without getting her fur tangled anymore. <em>A necessary change... Thank StarClan for that landslide so I now have it.</em>

<em>Wait, what am I saying?</em>

She shook her head as she stepped out into the clearing leading to the rest of the forest. They&#39;d be walking together for some time through ThunderClan&#39;s territory to reach the Moonpool, but her paws felt like weights every time she took a single step. 

<em>Oh StarClan, just send some lightning my way and I&#39;ll pick up the pace. I might need the coaxing.</em>

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Marigolddust&#39;s lemony gaze hazed over with empathy at Laurelblaze&#39;s resentment to the idea of going to the Moonpool to take her place as the leader.  He understood exactly how she felt, and couldn&#39;t help but relate the current situation with his own.  Needing to replace one of your closest friends and take on a position with more responsibility than you&#39;ve ever had before was stressful, not to mention full of grief.  They were both new at this, and didn&#39;t want to be where they were if it meant the cats before them could stay able enough to have the position.  <em><strong><em>&quot;It&#39;s... It&#39;s not easy, I know.  But I promise, it&#39;s not gonna be too bad, especially when you have a whole clan that&#39;s backing you up.&quot;</em></strong></em> He said softly, brushing against her shoulder gently as he moved so that he was standing a pawstep ahead of the tortoiseshell, trying to provide her with companionship while hinting that he was prepared to leave whenever she wished to.  He wasn&#39;t the opposite of used to seeing Laurelblaze in a mood such as this one, although it had begun to feel a bit more familiar the longer that he was the medicine cat.  As an apprentice, he used to think she was an unbeatable hero, perfect and wise.  Now, he was less oblivious, and he realized and understood that she was only a cat, just like him and everyone else.  She had emotions, and she had struggles.  Perhaps that made her an even stronger champion in his eyes.  

                  Soon enough, Laurelblaze had gotten a hold of herself, and Marigolddust found himself trailing along besides the fem as they made their way out of the camp enterance.  As the two slipped out of the enterance and out into the territory with newfound ease, Marigolddust realized that he had become the leader of the two.  Pausing, he glanced behind himself to find Laurelblaze taking on a bit of a slower pace.</span>

After a moment of hesitation, Marigolddust stopped his own progress so that he could fall into step with Laurelblaze.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Would you like to take the lead?&quot;</em></strong></em> He offered, although he said the words with quite a bit of reluctance behind them.  He didn&#39;t want to push his friend farther than she wanted to go, but at the same time, the sooner they got this over with, the sooner she could relax about it.  If she allowed herself to slow the process, it would only make the end of it all stray farther and farther away.  Perhaps if she was the one to lead him through the forest, her pace might quicken with a bit more ease behind each pawstep.  He wasn&#39;t very fond of leading trips like this, anyways, especially not when wandering into territory he hardly knew.

<em><strong><em>- Past III -</em></strong></em>

Finally, the whites of the warrioress&#39;s eyes were made visible as her eyelids opened, letting the she-cat look out at the world around her once more.  She even managed to speak words, <em>comprehendible</em> words at that, and recognize him.  Relaxation immediately caused his muscles to slack, a sigh of relief slipping past his lips as he calmed.  He had done it- he had awoken her, and she didn&#39;t seem too have too much brain damage, at least from what he could tell so far.  Sure, her words were quiet and slow, but that might prove to be an easy fix with time and practice.  A smile spread across his features as he met Rainsplash&#39;s gaze, holding it for a few more moments, just to make sure she wouldn&#39;t drift back off into whatever sleeping stage she might have been in before.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Yes, I&#39;m here,&quot;</em></strong></em> he concluded, offering her a kind expression as she began to step further into reality.  He paused for a hesitant moment, though, at the fem&#39;s question.  After a few seconds of thought, his smile returned to his face, curling the tips of his lips into a smile pf reassurance.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s done and over with.  You&#39;re safe now.&quot;</em></strong></em> he calmed, his voice soft and purposely more relaxed than it would have been if they were still in risk.  

               The smile on the medicine cat&#39;s face immediately faded as Rainsplash vomited, her gaze turning unfocused and painful.  Frowning now, Marigolddust tried to figure out what was going on.  Was this bad?  How bad might it be?  Was it severe enough for him to fall into panic again?  <em><strong><em>&quot;Can you move?  So you feel sick?  What hurts?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, voicing the questions one after another as he tried to figure out what was happening and how he could fix it.</span>

                      Was she retching because of her head injury?  Was it because of the clan&#39;s sickness?  Was it something else?  Carefully, Marigolddust brought vigil out of his pile of herbs, offering it the the she-cat.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Try eating this- it should help get whatever bad things are making you sick.  Do you feel like you can eat?  This&#39;ll help you to, if you don&#39;t.  You need to eat.&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, worry showing steadily through his gaze like sunlight through glass.

<em><strong><em>- Past II -</em></strong></em>

At his and Astermoon&#39;s return, they had begun to work on Lilachaze&#39;s body, working to clean and ready her for the vigil once the time came to move onto that part of the process.  Or, at least, he and Wolfprowl cleaned up her bloodied wounds.  Wolfprowl didn&#39;t seem to have too much trouble with the sight of the gore, but Astermoon seemed as if he had a bit of a different case.  Marigolddust could tell merely by the look on his face that he wasn&#39;t very comfortable with all of the blood, and Marigolddust had the urge to suggest for him to leave so that he didn&#39;t need to feel sick over it, although he kept silent.  Lilachaze had been important to all of them, even if they hardly knew each and had only spoken at very select times.  Marigolddust had been forced to be alright with the sight of so much blood when he had over a dozen patients thrown at him, needing medical assistance for wounds he couldn&#39;t have ever imagined previously.  Lilachaze&#39;s wounds looked like nothing works than anybody else&#39;s wounds in the medicine cat&#39;s eyes, his yellow gaze marked by the blood-filled moon the clan had experienced.</span>

                   <em><strong><em>&quot;I-Icestar?&quot;</em></strong></em> Marigolddust repeated, sparing a stray look over to his mottle-furred brother at the question.  He couldn&#39;t keep his voice from cracking as he spoke, still affected by their sister&#39;s death, but he gave it his best attempt.  It took a moment for the tuxedo to think over how he should respond to the inquiry.  His answer would be fairly negative and greivious if he were to be truthful, but the other tom needed hope right now.  Should he answer in lies to spare his brother from further hopelessness, or tell the truth and bring his mood down further?  Well, he would surely find out eventually, anyways... So perhaps speaking honestly wouldn&#39;t be so avoidable.  <em><strong><em>&quot;She&#39;s... Well, she hasn&#39;t regained many of her memories at all yet..&quot;</em></strong></em> he admitted, speaking softly as to avoid having passing ears overhear.  Marigolddust wanted nothing more than for Icestar to regain her memories and recognize somebody, <em>anybody</em>, but so far, he couldn&#39;t help her.  She couldn&#39;t recognize anything she had once known, and it felt as if she was a completely different cat overall.  Perhaps she was.

Along with grief that he fervently shoved down, he struggled with the need to feel strong. It was all they could hope to have right now, if any.

He had accepted Icestar’s retirement before Marigolddust even answered the question. After what had happened, and her loss of memory, there was no way she could lead. He kept these thoughts to himself though, the only hint of them being a small frown on his face as he groomed Lilachaze. <span class="mention" title="✧*̥˚ snips *̥˚✧#1759">@fuzz</span> <span class="mention" title="springypaws777#8108">@Springy &#129444;</span></span>

She rolled over and attempted to stand, her legs shaking. The scratches she got on her flanks sent sharp pains of resiliency. She shook her head, but then stopped as it gave her a headache.

<em><strong><em>- Past III -</em></strong></em>

Rainsplash made it clear that she had no interest in consuming the herbs he had to offer, even though they were the best remedy that he could think of for the situation.  Was there another strategy that would work better, something that was more natural and acceptable?  Did Marigolddust know that course of action, of was he left to be hopelessly bewildered?  A lump formed in his throat as he tried to think over what he was supposed to do, a fearful doubt that he couldn&#39;t quite swallow.  He watched helplessly as Rainsplash tried to stand.  It was movement, of course, and that was a good thing, but the fact that she was unable to stand without becoming nauseous or dizzy wasn&#39;t as good.  <em>Perhaps she&#39;ll get better with time,</em> he thought, the idea more hopeful than anything.  It could have made sense in the situation, though.  She had been gaining more and more control of her body the longer that they waited, and she was regaining her strength slowely.  Maybe if they waited long enough, she could return to her normal health without much interference.  It would be best if she tested and waited in his den, so that he could keep watch over her condition and make sure that she ate, despite her refusal to do so now.  

                 Whether or not Marigolddust was strong enough to carry another adult, he wasn&#39;t sure.  But he knew that all of this would be Bette if it was done in his den, and she wouldn&#39;t want to come to full healthwhile being exposed to the weather and the horrifying sights of their camp, which looked. Ore like a battlefield now.  And, in a way, it had become one only a day ago.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Are you alright if we move you to my den?  I&#39;ll leave you alone then, and we can wait and bring you back to full health,&quot;</em></strong></em> he offered, hoping that the idea sounded more pleasing to the warrioress.

       The virago&#39;s fluid tone told this tom otherwise; she was a master of faces and emotions. A dip of his skull and he did just that; wait as she finished her work, tail waving as he stepped back. Viridian eyes watched the work. Not being fond of delicate handiwork himself, his brutish activities never offered him time for it either. A hum once she finally turned his way, gander flickering back up to the harlequin pigmented pair of the new leader. 
<strong>&quot;Sure,&quot;</strong> Picking the thing back up, the bachelor strode over tot eh desired spot, letting it fall and sitting by it. He too - has noticed the fresh kill pile, it took an idiot not to comprehend the shortening that it will be facing as well as all the others in the other clans. So sharing a meal was the best option for now. 
    Conversation was a challenging search. Alerce was sure Laurel was already asked about her leader status by now several times. Surely, there were other conversation options.

While it was true she took longer than most to truly feel the effects of the cold, she wasn’t immune to it. She too preferred taking shelter in the sun when leaf-bare’s cool zephyrs coursed through their territory and left a chill running along every single cat’s spines. Laurelblaze may have appeared impervious, but she too had to admit sometimes she could get a little chilly. <strong>”Hah! I wasn’t asking for myself.”</strong> a quick joke, the she-cat puffed out her chest to make her point as she sauntered into the patch of sun with a smug expression on her face for her humorous comment. <strong>”I’m not immune to the cold, you know, I may be all big and furry but I too can suffer from the cold… I just handle it better.”</strong>

She hadn’t been laughing much in the past few days, but she was getting there, slowly. Trying to cause oneself to see the positives after going through so much in such a short period of time was a struggle for her. Laurelblaze still was reeling from it all. It hurt still for her, she imagined it might always hurt, but she had to keep on living— find some joy in the life she had already. 

What else was there for her to do?

The tortoiseshell femora stretched out her limbs as she sprawled out in the sun, letting out a pleased sigh as she felt stiffened limbs crack and release tension from all the delicate work she had been doing. *Honestly, I’d be better off just shoving the materials into the dens, but that’d just be half-finishing the job and it’d be sloppy. No, it required a deft touch, and she was more than skilled enough to handle den repairs. She might be a fighter at heart, but Laurelblaze also was able to build and maintain dens like her life depended on it. Her time spent with her father maintaining the nursery had taught her well.

<em><strong><em>- Past II -</em></strong></em>

At first, it had seemed u certain as to whether the fem really wanted to go to his den or not.  Her head injury was clearly cussing her problems, and it made it a bit difficult to tell what she was thinking by skewed facial expressions and gestures.  <em>Cold.</em>  He would have a nest of moss ready for her in his den, although he would likely need to get more, as to provide her with the warmth she needed.  He had been needing to gather more moss recently so he could make extra nests for unexpected situations such as the one, but by the end of the day, there had still been no spares.  He had to preserve each bundle of the soft plants as if it were scarce morsels of food.  Moss was a necessity with healing more than a large amount of other herbs and resources were.  He needed it to provide patients with drinks, to make nests, to clean wounds, and, especially with the coming season of leaf-bare, to provide his patients and himself with warmth.  The chilly season was only looking closer and closer to the damaged clan, but every time Marigolddust though too much on the topic he would panic.  

                 Of course he still gathered as many herbs as he could, but they were becoming harder and harder to find with the change in weather, not to mention being washed out and drowned by the landslide that seemed to have happened so long ago.  The amount of cats he had to tend and care for was unbelievable, and they sucked up his resources almost ga than he could collect them.  As a result, he never gained any more than he already had, no matter how much he labored to try and grow the amount of plants stationed on his shelves of herbs.  This left him at a steady, continued rate of hardly any herbs.</span>

                 Shaking himself out of his thought, the lemon-toned eyes of the young tom wandered back to Rainsplash, and he could finally see some hint as to what, or rather <em>where</em>,  she truly wanted to be, and it seemed that that place was his den.  <em>So she can relax and heal with some time,</em> he thought, relief washing over his muscles as he sent her a knowledgeable nod, bending down enough so that, with the effort from both of the cats, he managed to get the warrioress onto his back steadily enough for her not to risk falling off.  The weight of the older cat made his lengthy, thin legs tremble with effort.  He wasn&#39;t at all used to using his muscles, even when he had been a warrior and had hunted daily for the clan.  He had never been a cat for strength or toughness, rather, he was much better with agility, speed, and stealth.  This didn&#39;t exactly help him with the situation, and it took him a decent length of time to manage to drag Rainslash to the enterance of his den.  Taking the moment to make a deep inhale and exhale, he continued to slowely carry the she-cat into his den, through the patients, and to the neat he had had prepared for such a case.  Setting her down in the soft moss carefully, Marigolddust released short, shallow pants before regaining his breath.  Thank Starclan he hadn&#39;t dropped her on any of the patients, or at all- even if he had been fairly close to doing so.</span>

                  As Rainsplash was settled into her temporary nest and Marigolddust had gotten control of himself, he immediately went off to grab some moss, soaking some in the small pool of fairly clean water- or, rather, as clean as he could get- in the corner of his den.  Once he had finished, he returned with the moss, offering his clanmate the wet moss to quench her thirst and some extra moss to orotect her a little bit more from the cold breezes that had come to sweep themselves into the den.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Do you need anything else?&quot;</em></strong></em> He asked, offering a kind smile and curious expression, not wanting to leave her when he could still be attending to her needs.  She was his top priority right now, but once she was satisfied, he would likely go back to organizing his herbs for future and present patients.  Though, of course, he wouldn&#39;t leave without making sure everything was set.

<em><strong><em>- Past I -</em></strong></em>

Marigolddust failed to take notice of the small frown that had tainted Wolfprowl&#39;s expression, and was instead focused mainly on Astermoon, along with Lilachaze, now that the question had been asked.  As his brother&#39;s tail made contact with Marigolddust&#39;s own shoulders, the medicine cat couldn&#39;t help but tense a little more.  Physical contact with his siblings was something that Marigolddust wasn&#39;t accustomed to, and it was clear that that had yet to change.  Perhaps it would, someday, if the three remaining family member <em>did</em> happen to get closer again.  But it wasn&#39;t certain how long that would take for them to accomplish, and Marigolddust couldn&#39;t help but remain nervous around his kin.  

                  Curling his tail a little closer to himself, his eyes never strayed at his sister&#39;s lifeless, unmoving features.  With Astermoon&#39;s apologize, Marigolddust quickly shook his head.  &quot;It&#39;s not your fault at all, it&#39;s just... A problem.  We&#39;ll figure it out,&quot;**** he said, his voice soft and unsure, despite the confidence that was meant to be displayed alongside the words.  Of course he didn&#39;t know if he would manage to fix Iceheart, and he wasn&#39;t sure what he would do if he couldn&#39;t.  Would Laurelblaze take the place as Thunderclan&#39;s leader?  Was she emotionally ready for that?  Physically?  Would it be too much for her to handle?  Would they ever get the old Icestar back?  Marigolddust didn&#39;t know the answers to any of his questions, and thinking about it only made his anxieties grow stronger.</span>

                  He stopped this steep incline as he put his focus back to her herbs in his own paws, as well as his brothers&#39;.  They were preparing their sister&#39;s body- he should be focusing on that, rather than worrying over a cat who might still have a chance of returning to normal.  <em>Would either of you like to say some words first?</em>  The question was one that he hadn&#39;t expected to need to answer at the beginning of the day.  Now, he still couldn&#39;t quite get past the shock of everything that had happened.  What would he say?  What <em>should</em> he say?  He wasn&#39;t sure, and he couldn&#39;t be confident in his emotions at the time.  His mind and heart were both confused, fuzzing in and out as they trying to wrap themselves around the events of that say and that moon.  He had a lot to think about, and he just wasn&#39;t sure he would be able to get through this part of his thoughts so early on.  Even so, this was the only chance he would get.  He had to say <em>something</em>, didn&#39;t he?  

                      <em><strong><em>&quot;I... I hope to see you in a dream sometime soon, Lilac,&quot;</em></strong></em> he said, his voice hardly even a whisper as he spoke.  <em>I want to make this up to you.. I&#39;ll be waiting...</em> He thought, trying to find some sort of answer or response behind the cold features that had once been so familiar to him before Periwinklekit&#39;s death and Wolfprowl&#39;s harshness as a kit.  He didn&#39;t know what he would do if she really did show to him during the night or at the Moonpool.  What would he say?  Perhaps not even days if thought could give him a proper answer, and so he assumed he would have had to do something he wasn&#39;t very fond of; improvise.  But maybe it would be worth it, just so he could see her again and finally say sorry.  At least that part of the plan had been cemented.

<em><strong><em>- Past II -</em></strong></em>

Relief must have been contagious, because as a sudden sense of relaxation washed over Rainsplash, Marigolddust shared in the feeling.  So the water did a good job at helping her, or at least her dry throat.  That was definitely a good sign, and so was the smile that she shot up to him.  He didn&#39;t want to imagine what could have happened if he had taken a little longer to find the fem, or hadn&#39;t realized she was alive at all.  How many bodies could he have passed that hadn&#39;t really been dead?  Perhaps he would check every pulse from now on, even if I out of a hundred cats would truly still be living.  He didn&#39;t want to risk loosing clanmates due to his own laziness or wellbeing, for that matter.  

                   It was a good thing that that had become his job.  Now, it was the rules to be self-sacrificing, even if he didn&#39;t quite understand just how much of a burden or a pain this could become for him in the near future.  The work he had gotten failed to teach him the lesson he might one day learn, as he would have tried to help each cat who had become his patient in any case.  It was quite odd sometimes, when he realized just how fitting he could be for this new to of his, even if the stress held more weight to it than hunting or patrols.  He had never been one to enjoy inflicting pain on others or going around the territory, always with the risk of finding mischievous outsiders.  Now, he could <em>be</em> a mischievous outsiders and still have little to no trouble, not that he would either way.</span>

                  With his smile being soft and relieved, the stormy furred tom nodded a small, acknowledging nod.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Well, then, you&#39;re recovering quickly, even if you haven&#39;t exactly regained enough strength to stand... If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll leave you here to relax and recover, and you might even be able to sleep now that you&#39;ve reached a fairly comfortable waking state.  Anyhow, no more medicine talk... Just let me know if you need anything else, okay?  I&#39;ll be over there, sorting some herbs if you ever need me.&quot;</em></strong></em> He said, tossing his chin softly in the direction of his herb shelves in a attention-aiming gesture.  And, with that, he dipped his head respectfully to the warrioress, before beginning to get his herbs ready for the next patient that might need his attention, sending Rainsplash one more glance back before putting his focus on the world of herbs.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">When light shines directly behind an object or perhaps even a shape, that thing turns into a silhouette. In the simplest of terms, a silhouette is the dark shape and outline of a figure against a lighter background. Often dark and color, as stated before, silhouettes target the outline of the object the light is reflecting off of rather than going straight through it. Although not meant to be scary most of the time, they can come off as quite dour. In any case, the sun was rising and it was a new day. A new chance to start things over, perhaps? At least, that’s the way Smokingshore looked at things. Optimistic, yes, but cautiously optimistic at that. She had been duped before. 

Her pelt was a mix of black and ginger and her eyes were a blood-chilling green although one pupil had a speck of red in it. It wasn’t noticeable to most, but she knew. She knew everything there was to know about herself after all, because if she didn’t, who would? Surely not her parents - StarClan knows where they were by now and she didn’t care enough to know. Her tail was long, extraordinarily so, with a scar at it’s base. She also had a scar running up the rightmost side of her neck - that was a near death experience if she had ever known one. But, against the shadow of the rising sun she sat, looking off into the distance like she was thinking about something philosophical when she was in fact not thinking about anything at all.

Much like she approached the world as an outline- a silhouette, he breeched it with a sense of dichotomy to her refraction. He was a looming feature- like a single brown leaf on an oak tree- echoing the death of the warmth before them and ushering in the cold. His eyes were that contrast- the one represented by the leaf. They stormed over those who approached- reverberating their chill off the rich brown color of his tabby coat. The tiger striped tom was quite unusual- yet for few he was a mimic of one before him. Those few were likely fading- elders to be clear.  

The tabby tom caught sight of the ginger and black she cat- his large head tipping to the side as mumbled his memory over and over for a name. Part of him felt like he had seen green eyes like that before- perhaps loved them. His past life mate, a dusty feather of some sort? He hadn&#39;t the mental strength of memory to connect the familiarity. All he knew was that the color green was quite alluring.   

<strong>&quot; Are you content to loiter- or will you come sit beside a stranger and converse? Rest assured, I make  no aspersions, while I may sound blunt- there is no offence drummed from my end.&quot;</strong> The tabby tom straightened his head and shifted his paws, stormy gaze awaiting her response.  <strong>&quot; In the event you should wish not to remain a stranger- I will extend to you my name. I am Brindlesnake.&quot;</strong> <span class="mention" title="blaire#8010">@peri™</span></span>

Foxpaw&#39;s gaze snapped up to meet his. The warrior&#39;s question processed in his brain, and after a moment of uneasy silence, the apprentice turned away. <strong>&quot;I&#39;ll get it&quot;</strong> He couldn&#39;t recognise his own voice. Like a lake during Leaf-Bare, it was frozen over, and deep below darkness lurked. 

Hollyfrost&#39;s scent overwhelmed him. Foxpaw inhaled it deeply. It comforted him. 

<strong>&quot;What are we doing with the moss?&quot;</strong> His returning question seemed na&#239;ve. A part of him knew what Astermoon planned to do already.

A steady rhythm had returned to the camp it had seemed, despite all the chaos that had ensued in the short time it had been since the battle. Laurelstar herself had been more active within camp than she had in the time just following the brutal conflict, able to talk to her clanmates, able to muster the confidence a leader needed. She was brimming with vibrance, like new life was coursing through her. Vitality through her nine lives was evident, she felt as if she could conquer the world with just a single slash of her claws.

Yet it was never enough, she wished Hollyfrost was here to see her.

As much as she missed her mate, she knew she couldn’t stop looking out for their family. Holly wouldn’t have wanted that, it was up to her now to look out for their children. One of which had been a concern since the landslide had occurred. <strong>”Featherpaw? Are you around?”</strong> she called to her son for a moment, trying to spot his dark tabby fur amongst the camp as she looked around. He had been severely injured in the landslide, his leg being crushed under a large boulder and having to have been freed. The battle surely must have been hard on him as well, he must have been so scared.

<em>StarClan knows it was for the others, I can’t imagine how they’re taking it right now.</em>

She had to ensure her kits would be safe. That they would be able to move past this and smile again. They deserved all the love and happiness in the world in her eyes. She had to ensure they could recover.

Featherpaw had always been a rather absent-minded tom, constantly among his own thoughts or another world entirely before being brought to reality by something or someone. But since the war, he&#39;d become more absent entirely...and he hardly seemed to realize it. His mind had become particularly foggy, thoughts muddling together into a hazy mist that refused to release him of its clutches. Blue eyes were horribly dull as if he wasn&#39;t actually among his own body, merely limping about mindlessly. Whenever this behavior was brought up, he either uncharastically ignored it, tried to avoid answering or ultimately melted into a puddle of misery. To be honest, he despised his new life - he was saddened and couldn&#39;t seem to make himself genuinely smile or another for that matter, stuck in this dark pit of despair.
    It almost seemed as if someone had struck him multiple times over, despite his worst injury being his leg. It would probably never heal and become normal again, which was quite small when he thought about something else that would never be normal again. His life. Their life. Thunderclan&#39;s life. Icestar had been murdered - though she apparently arose once more, she was unable to lead her clan for any longer. He wondered if that meant he&#39;d gain a new mentor...Icestar - or rather, Iceheart now - seemed rather odd as of late. He desperately hoped against it, but he couldn&#39;t locate any optimism within him to tell him otherwise. A sigh escaped him at the thought. Another loss.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">But perhaps the worst loss of all had been Hollyfrost. The whole family had been shocked to their cores, broken and shattered on that gruesome day. Though he felt horrible over it still, his worries reached to his mother, Laurelstar. Having only gained her name a short while ago, he wondered if she was recovering from the previous events or not. Iceheart and her had been close...Hollyfrost and her especially close...and now, both had more or less been taken from her. He wondered how she was managing with her new role. Maybe she needed a hug.

The tom wouldn&#39;t have to search for the tortoiseshell, hearing her beckoning a few moments after he&#39;d finished those very thoughts. The black tabby rose, limping in the direction of the large feline, blue eyes poised upon the familiar figure. His tail swayed slowly as he reached her, whiskers quivering as he gazed up at his mother. <strong>&quot;Hi, mom.&quot;</strong> he greeted, a small smile upon his face. <strong>&quot;Did you need me for something?&quot;</strong> he inquired. Perhaps she needed him to assist her in some sort of task. He hadn&#39;t been able to help out a lot since the mudslide, but he was ready to fix that now if such was what his mother wished for.

He was up, finally, but clearly wasn’t able to walk like she hoped he could. It would be a struggle for him, she knew it, but she was positive he could manage as a warrior in this state. They’d find workarounds in his training, she was sure of it. <em>Just after I find him another mentor, unless Iceheart is still up to it, maybe it may help jog her memory.</em> she watched her son approach her and she flashed him a small smile, pleased to see him. Seeing him up and active felt better than seeing him injured and nest-bound. Featherpaw was strong, and she was proud of him, just as she was her other children.

<strong>”I just wanted to check in on you. I wanted to ask how you were.”</strong> she was straightforward and to the point, not beating around the bush. She wanted to get an insight into his headspace right now, to see how she could possibly help him and the others. This was a rough time for all of them, the pain of Hollyfrost’s loss was evident in their family, she wanted to see how she could help them— if she could. <strong>”I know the battle must have been scary, believe me they’re never easy to deal with. Especially when we lose so many cats at once… I’m sorry.”</strong> she let out a shaky sigh as she remembered the day it had occurred so vividly. The metallic scent of blood hanging in the air, the sounds of cats yowling and screeching as they ripped each other apart and suffered injury after injury. It was horrific, her camp being turned into a battlefield. 

<em>I won’t let us be infiltrated so easily ever again. Our clan will be safe from now on.</em>

When compared to everything that had happened in Thunderclan recently, the last thing that was on his mind was himself. He frequently thought about his mother, siblings and mentor...perhaps she&#39;d be his former mentor now, as every time someone brought the lynx point up, there seemed to be a sense of unease and despair among the air. The tabby worried about her honestly, fearing the moment he put together enough courage to speak to her himself...would she even recognize him? The very idea is what kept him from doing so, however silly others might view it as. He&#39;d lost so much in various ways and quite frankly, he wasn&#39;t ready to lose his mentor among the mass of other things that were gone forever.
    As the tortoiseshell spoke, Featherpaw could feel his eyes beginning to burn with tears that begged to form and spill from his eyes, but he forced them back. This was probably not the time for that - his mother had even more duties to tend to now and he was old enough not to need to be held by her as he sobbed. No...he had to be strong, just like her. If she could lead a clan in these rough times, then he could manage to keep a firm grip on his own emotions. The tom inhaled a shaky breath, letting it out slowly as he turned his gaze toward Laurelstar&#39;s <em>Please don&#39;t fail me, voice.</em>
    <strong>&quot;Why are you sorry? Those cats hurt you just as much as they hurt the rest of us...maybe even more. It&#39;s not your fault they did all those mean and horrible things...&quot;</strong> he managed to say with a mostly steady voice, somewhat surprised at the apology he was given. Why would anyone who fought alongside them be sorry? It wasn&#39;t their fault... <strong>&quot;I&#39;m sure if you could&#39;ve done something to save everyone...you would have...&quot;</strong> It was honestly scary to see the entire thing play out, horrifying even. He could&#39;ve lost Laurelstar too..

Laurelstar’s first steps onto the Highledge as the now formally-recognized Leader of ThunderClan felt heavy, weighed down with exhaustion and weariness from the moons that had come to pass. Weighed down by the pressure of expectations from her clanmates, weighed down by the grief for the cats who she loved and then lost, all in a split second. Each moment she thought of the cats no longer with them, her clanmates, her family, it threatened to tear her apart. Yet after receiving her lives, she was expected to lead them, to be strong and to do right by the cats still among the living. She had a duty to uphold to them all.

Hence why she was gathering them here today, to address them formally.

The russet-toned sovereign ascended the steps to the ledge jutting out from her new den, her posture tall and regal, like a newly-coronated queen taking her first steps to her throne where she’d address her subjects. They had to acknowledge her as their new leader, the cat who they’d follow into battle at their head, the one who’d lay down her life for their sakes. She held so much power at the tips of her paws, and here she was, about to dictate how she was going to wield it.

<strong>”Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey gather beneath the Highledge!”</strong>

The sound of his mother&#39;s voice was a familiar one. A powerful one that carried over the camp with ease, one that didn&#39;t waver in the slightest. But now, as he gazed in her direction, stationed upon the Highledge, it seemed...different. Once a different cat stood upon that same ledge. And one before them and one before them. It was a place where leader&#39;s stood and she was one of them now, as strange as it was to think about sometimes. With a flick of an ear, he arose at her beckoning, blue eyes wide and curious. As instructed, the apprentice took his place among the others, ears pricked with interest. What would today&#39;s meeting be about? Something normal like ceremonies? Or something more drastic that concerned the clan? He would prefer something more subtle in all honesty. Perhaps their lives were finally becoming more stable.</span>

The work that lay in constant wait for him in his den had begun to shrink down as he healed more and more of the clans I jured members, much to his relief. Fortunately, cats didn&#39;t get so beaten up every day as they had during the day of the battle, and he was prepared to search for as many herbs as possible once he didn&#39;t have any more patients to worry about.  He would have. Plenty of time to spend searching, anyhow, and he would have healed the cats who couldn&#39;t help him before, even if they had been willing.  Now, he found it easy to leave the cats in his den for a few moments, and one such moment was when he heard Laurelblaze&#39;s call ring through the camp, calling forth his clanmates to the foot of the highledge.  

                    Curiousity plucked at his ears, causing them to perk and making him straighten, looking out of his den and at the growing crowd.  <em>Her first meeting as the leader,</em> he realized, before standing and, after checking up on all of the cats in his den, walking out of his den to join those who had gathered together.  He knew it was difficult for Laurelblaze to face everything she had lost by standing in place of Icestar, and, in general, she hadn&#39;t been feeling the best, plauged with guilt and greif.  This must have been something important, then, mustn&#39;t it?  

                  Passing by only a few cats, Marigolddust made sure to remain on the outermost layer of the group, away from the majority of the commotion, but moving closer in so to hear the coming news better.  He couldn&#39;t think of any cats who would be gaining a new rank, but, again, he wasn&#39;t the most aware of the positions of all of his clanmates.  He found himself unaware of the idea of any other news, uncertain what else might change.  Perhaps it was everything that happened that caused him to be oblivious enough to make such assumptions, but he wouldn&#39;t hear what he expected he would today.</span>

<strong>”If it isn’t obvious enough, I have received my  nine lives from our warrior ancestors, and now am the leader of ThunderClan. I intend to use my power to protect you all, and to keep every single one of you safe.”</strong> She spoke with a firm, unwavering tone, her heterochromatic gaze burning brightly with a new resolve. Laurelblaze was no more, she was now a fully-recognized leader of one of the forest clans. She had the power of their ancestors blessed upon her, and she was ready to take on every single obstacle in her path. A new age had dawned upon the clan, and she was determined to lead her clan into glory.

<strong>”Together we have weathered destruction from disasters, found traitors amongst our ranks, and have defeated an old evil that had been dogging us for moons, and here we stand. We have survived together due to your valiant efforts, and I am proud to be blessed with the opportunity to lead you all.”</strong> Her flames had nearly died out during the landslide crisis, and in the aftermath, but here she was now, ready to spark the flame that would ignite a brand new inferno, ready to scorch the world that lied ahead of her. <strong>”Together, we shall rise again and honor the ones we have lost, I will ensure no one ever takes advantage of us ever again. We will not live in fear any longer, for we are stronger than our enemies will ever know.”</strong>

<strong>”ThunderClan shall stand tall, as we have for countless generations before us. No one shall take advantage of us ever again. I will ensure our prosperity remains, and that we will have a bright future to look forward to.”</strong>

She blinked for a moment, gesturing for the crowd to remain quiet, for this was not the only reason why she had gathered them today. Her gaze swept across the crowd, and in her heart, she knew it was time. 

<strong>”However, I cannot do that alone.”</strong></span>

       Grapplers kissed the snow ridden ground, meeting with the terrain as per the gathers the hierarchs of this clan would broadcast. The peculiarly pigmented tom eventually made his way to the crowd as the just-as-so-interestingly patterned sovereign began her speech.Surely it was winter, and as usual, perhaps the fae was meaning to encourage more hunting. Where IceStar previously stood, now stood the new clan leader. Laurel - as he so learned, had settled into her position as hierarch quite fluidly. Silently. None to console her just as her mate did. Reliance for emotional dependency was on the clan members now, though of course such a level of trust so soon onto just anyone can not be disposed onto. Laurel - until further notice, was alone. Her independence radiated. And even if just a moment, Alerce envied it.</span>

She knew this was coming, of course, because every leader had needed a deputy, needed someone to pass the torch to when their time had run out. It was always exciting to find out who it would be, though, who would take over when Laurelstar’s reign was over. She knew whoever it was would be a good pick because she had full confidence in the leader and her options. Chewing the inside of her lip, she remained silent as she awaited the big reveal. Her gaze moved from the leader around to the group of cats and back up to the leader. Everyone seemed on edge and rightfully so, this would likely determine ThunderClan’s future.</span>

Featherpaw&#39;s eyes widened as he gazed up at his mother. Her every word met his ears and he glanced around those gathered briefly as she spoke. There was a new feeling among him - that of a secure nature. <em>She&#39;s going to make things okay. We&#39;ll be safe again.</em> His whiskers quivered at the thought as she continued, suddenly bringing forth an unexpected sentence. <em>Is it...that time?</em> Perhaps it was. He waited expectantly.</span>

Marigolddust&#39;s heart swelled with Laurelstar&#39;s speech, proud of her for having the guts to admit that she had been low, even if the realization made him feel far too much like a grandfather.  With a twitch of an ear, he ignored the connection, and instead smiled up at the new leader.  Perhaps the meeting was just one to introduce her into her new position, letting all of Thunderclan know that they would call her by her new name.  It could have been enough for a clan meeting, he knew, although he found himself becoming hesitant as the speech continued, making the crowd around the large tortoiseshell suspenseful.  What did she plan to announce?  What was going to happen?  Why, exactly, had she really brought together this meeting?  Would there really be any ceremonies today, or was it something else?  

                Golden eyes widened at Laurelstar&#39;s last statement, a new idea finally dawning on him.  Was this what it sounded like it was?  Curiousity didn&#39;t fail to continue strong in his gaze as he tried to meet Laurelstar&#39;s, but he felt newfound anxiety as his thoughts wandered further and further into the idea he was sure would be coming.  Was this what he thought it was?  No, maybe it wasn&#39;t... Perhaps she was just nearing the end of her speach.  But, despite what he was trying to figure out, he knew that only one announcement would be led up to so strongly, an announcement he wasn&#39;t sure he was ready to hear.  He didn&#39;t like change, and, in fact, despised it.  This announcement could concrete that change, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel scared.  Anxiously, the young medicine cat listened on, awaiting the news to come.</span>

Although usually quite uninterested in these scenarios, the older apprentice studied the newly made leader with some form of newfound curiosity. Did this happen to mean Laurelstar would already be choosing her deputy? Of course there would be several cats anticipating this announcement, as could be seen by the many wide eyes staring up at the multicolored she-cat with awe. 

<em>I wonder..</em> Cloverpaw had been quite reserved - which wasn&#39;t uncommon, but she&#39;d been almost traumatized to even speak, and yet when she looked at felines like Foxpaw and Featherpaw, Laurelstar&#39;s kits.. she felt some pang of jealousy. One thing Clover had always failed to have was a loving mother. Of course she was excited about the new deputy, but deep down was some sort of growing hatred in the molly&#39;s chest. But she wondered who it could be... just to take her mind off it.</span>

It was a fact of life, that a leader could not oversee a clan alone. The Code decreed a leader must have a successor set in place, and for her, the time had come, and she had her decision in mind. One cat in particular stood out amongst the crowd, and she knew the clan would be in good paws when it was her time to pass it on to the said individual. A cat who had shown dedication to their clan, one who strived to serve, a cat she could trust with the fate of her clan when her time as leader came to an end. A cat who was truly worthy of the title of deputy.

She stood tall, brimming with confidence in her decision and how she was addressing her clan. She had faith in them all, but this one individual had stood out to her over time, and she was truly pleased to be finally revealing her decision at last. Laurelstar felt it in her bones that this decision would be the best for the clan, and that she would be picking an excellent candidate for her deputy. A cat she knew she’d work well with, someone who she knew would conduct their work with diligence and with great zeal. <strong>”I have decided on who I will select as my deputy. I have gathered everyone here to bear witness to this occasion.”</strong> her twin hues of ocean-blue and honey-amber bore down into the crowd, though the cat she was preparing to promote was the primary recipient of said attention. She could feel the tension on the air, the clan was buzzing, wondering who would be their next deputy. Who she would be leading the clan alongside, her second-in-command. A comrade she’d share power with, a sentinel who would report to her and help her carry out her work as leader. She knew just who would suit the job, one she knew could handle the pressures of leadership. One that could blossom into it as she had, for she saw incredible potential in them.

<strong>”I say these words before StarClan, so that the spirits of our warrior ancestors may hear and approve of my choice…”</strong>

<strong>”The new deputy of ThunderClan is…”</strong></span>

       The former deputy really knew how to manipulate suspense. A maestro of time and suspended minutes. The pause drew everyones focus to the focal point that was her. Breaths were held and delayed. Everyone sat there unblinking as the minute drew longer by the second. Alerce himself fell hefty on these attributes.

The anticipation was dreadful. Featherpaw leaned forward instinctively, gaze never once leaving the tortoiseshell upon the Highledge. <em>Come on...come on...</em> His whiskers quivered, tail flicking about as he waited for the name to be called. Who was it? His gaze flickered over the surrounding crowd as if he could pick out the face by mere thought, but everyone seemed just as clueless as himself. He inhaled, a breath that was held as he waited anxiously for the announcement. He could hardly take the suspense.</span>

<strong>”…Alerceclaw.”</strong>

The tortoiseshell admittedly had a feeling the tom would one day be the one standing atop the Highledge, as her successor, however. He was a dedicated and loyal warrior of ThunderClan, and it had made her decision notably much easier. These two traits she believed were incredibly important for any leader of a clan. They could be a talented, and gifted warrior, but true loyalty and tenacity in the face of adversity were the factors of which she believed forged an excellent leader. This would be the start of a new part of his life, and she knew he would be great. It was always a difficult change to cope with, but she had the upmost faith in him. If he had any worries, she would be more than willing to impart her knowledge from her time as deputy unto him. <em>StarClan knows we’re both new at our jobs, though I hope all the time I spent shadowing Icestar had prepared me enough. I’ll have to do the same for him.</em>

She flashed him a confident smile and gestured for him to step forward from the crowd, she could see all eyes were trained on him, a spotlight practically being cast down upon him. This was a momentous occasion only so many cats ever experienced in their lives, and whether he would accept the role or not was to be decided here and now.

<strong>”Do you accept the role of deputy of ThunderClan, Alerceclaw?”</strong>

She sincerely prayed he would say yes, for this would be an incredibly awkward affair if he did publicly decline. Might cause her reason to doubt her authority, but she might have been overthinking it. This was the right decision for the clan, she just knew it. Her gut feeling was almost never wrong, and she knew he would be the best successor she could possibly have. She was positive the rest of the clan would agree with her decision as well. It was all up to him whether he would accept the position, and she wouldn’t judge him for any decision he would make. It was his choice, after all.

<em>I really hope he does accept it though.</em>

       A small puff of air. Relieved exhalation and the mass of the population of Thunderclan had found it in their torso&#39;s to proceed with the function of the respiratory system. It took this tuxedo a moment to understand what the name was that the madame on the tall, oversized sedimentary had said. The series of vowels and consonants to make up a familiar name. <em>His</em> name. <em>AlerceClaw</em>. Emerald gander pinpointed on the sachem, rubbery black lips tightened to a thin line. Though Laurel and he got off to an exciting start, sparring at the olympics, there was still this moment now. Perhaps there was a moment then and any other interaction after that which revealed his traits to which she considered valuable. They say, sparring with someone strips you of your attributes. You speak the same tongue in motion. And perhaps it was compatible in a professional relationship that was the one suggested now. 
    Her showcase of denticles set the toms previously rigid physique relaxed. He buzzed with honor as he forced a calm exterior, a grateful dip of his cranium, a little smile to reciprocate Laurels free language in physiognomy. 
<strong>&quot;I do accept it with gratitude, LaurelStar,&quot;</strong> He was careful with wording.</span>

Finally, his suspicions had been concluded, and although he wasn&#39;t surprised, his emotions only sparked into something stronger, causing his tail to twitch side to side continually and making him unable to keep himself from figiting.  A new deputy.  Marigolddust had never known another deputy besides Laurelstar as his own before, and the idea of doing so made him more than nervous.  How was he to respond?  Would this new deputy like him?  Should he like them?  Who could it be?  Would they betray the clan, too, while it was still struggling?  <em>Starclan, please say they&#39;ll be a good choice... Don&#39;t let Silentwing trick us one last time.</em> He silently prayed, closing his eyes in anticipation as he awaited the name that would change the clan from here on out.  He trusted Laurelblaze&#39;s decision, and could feel nothing but guilt at the fact that he found himself becoming so uncertain.  But, unfortunately, he couldn&#39;t keep himself from becoming anxious over something such as this, especially when even a cat as strong and vigilant as Laurelstar could be tricked into making a choice too wrong to take back.  And, to be honest, he worried that he would t work well with whoever might be chosen.  He hoped for a cat with a good nature, and, to be honest, the virtues that Laurelstar explained sounded... Well, reliable.  And, to complete this new sense of relief, he heard something he didn&#39;t expect to hear; a familiar name.</span>

               <em><strong><em>&quot;Alerceclaw?&quot;</em></strong></em> He gasped, the medicine cat talking more to himself than anybody else.  He let his eyes land on the tall form of the familiar, almost nastalgic presence of the dark tuxedo, eyes wide and mouth hanging open slightly, agape.  Marigolddust hadn&#39;t expected to hear the name of the warrior, out of all of the others in the clan, being called, but, somehow, the decision was one he was comfortable in, which was rarer than some might expect.  He knew Alerceclaw was an honorable warrior, and perhaps this new rank would up his mood a little, give him more of the strength and fire he had in his prime, as he had explained to Marigolddust when they had first met.  Marigolddust had been a kitten then, and Alerceclaw had been teaching him early on how to do the hunters crouch.  The tom was definitely a good teacher, even with kits of all ages, from his experience.  Slowely, a small smile appeared on his expression.  Maybe this could be a good decision, one that would better the clan as a whole, even if it meant that their next talk might turn out to be a bit awkward.  Training a kit to fight and then being by their side while they took on the job of healing could, as he guessed, be a bit uncomfortable if done incorrectly.  But, even so, it would be worth a try once they had the time where Alerceclaw was free for a conversation, after all of the congratulations that would certainly be shared.</span>

It was set in stone then, her deputy was chosen, and Alerceclaw accepted the position with gratitude. This was a defining moment in their clan’s history, for this would affect their future forever. She looked forward to seeing how Alerceclaw would progress as her deputy, and how they would work together in mapping out the fate of ThunderClan. She looked forward to their future, she was positive he would be an excellent leader one day. For now, it was a matter of him adjusting to his new role. She’d have to discuss it with him soon after this, it was quite a lot to remember and to learn. She had quite a rocky start as deputy, and she wanted to help him out as much as she could so he could avoid such a problem.

<strong>”Well then, I’m glad… ThunderClan this meeting is adjourned!”</strong> she dismissed her clanmates with a swish of her tail, before her odd gaze rested back upon the dark-colored tom. <strong>”Alerceclaw, I would like for you to come to my den so I may discuss what to expect from your promotion.”</strong> she dipped her skull to the tom, before she took a few steps back from the edge of the ledge, turning around so she would enter the small cave that the Highledge jutted out from. It would be quite a bit of information to be taking in all at once, but she was sure he would manage. Being a deputy was a far cry from being a warrior, but it brought with it it’s own sense of accomplishment and excitement. Only so many cats ever became one, it was most certainly a pivotal part of a cat’s life to become one.

She slipped through the entrance of her den, sauntering towards her nest where she took her seat— awaiting the tom to follow after her so they may have their meeting.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Smokingshore had never been particularly close with those in her family. In fact, she had considered herself estranged from them on her own terms. A lot of things led up to this, but the catalyst was, she thought, that night with her father. A shiver rolled it’s fingers down her spine at the thought. It was raining that night, she remembered it clearly, so clearly to the point where it was playing on loop in her mind her again. She was still quite young when the whole situation occurred, but she was old enough to remember. And sometimes, she wished she didn’t. Memory was the burden of one’s existence. 

Thankfully, a voice dragged the odd-pelted female out of her eidolon and she turned her gaze upward to face him. She felt herself smile the slightest bit as he continued speaking, flicking an ear like she were flicking away a fly.  She knew conversation wouldn’t hurt, especially in her state, so she replied with a flick upward of her tail tip. <em><strong>”Conversation never hurt anyone,”</strong></em> mused she with a side eye of knowing towards the tom. Gaze trailing up, the feline continued: <em><strong>”Besides, we meet many strangers in this lifetime. Why not make it one less?”</strong></em> At the mention of names, she laughed the slightest bit. <em><strong>”Brindlesnake. A pleasure. Call me Smokingshore,”</strong></em> her name rolled off of the tongue easily. Or so she thought. In any case, her evergreen gaze found itself fixated on him again, awaiting his response.

<em>past</em>


The golden and brown pelted molly slipped once more out of the apprentices den, turning her face up towards the sun and drawing in a deep breath. It was quite cold, but seeing the sun light up a cerulean sky was a very welcomed change from the last moon of heavy rains. Soon snow would blanket the ground she walked,  but for now dainty brown and white mitts tread on dry earth. She waited just outside of the den for Gullypaw, a little smile on her face and her white tipped tail waving to and fro. 

<strong>”It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it?”</strong> She asked the tom as he exited the den beside her. Wrenpaw had always been a rather high energy feline, so being stuck inside had been miserable for her after the battle. She’d spent plenty of time cooped up in the medicine den, and then in the apprentices den after that. Today, she could finally enjoy being in the camp and basking in the sunshine. Still, she would be lying if she said she wouldn’t rather be out in the forest hunting or training. Perhaps she could go see Marigolddust later and ask if he would let her go hunting. Her amber eyes flicked towards Gullypaw. <strong>”So, how about that clover crown?”</strong> <span class="mention" title="Soopest#7555">@Soop</span></span>

<strong>present</strong>

It had been a little over a moon since the battle with the dark forest cats, and Wrenpaw’s wounds had finally healed enough for her to get back to her usual duties. Well, her physical wounds had healed at least. Though the worst seemed to be over, her mind was still plagued with uncertainties which had left her feeling a bit on edge. She would wear the scars that she received in battle for the rest of her life, and even an entire lifetime couldn’t erase the memories of what had happened or the images of the things that she had witnessed. Still, things were seeming better and brighter especially now that she was able to leave camp again. She had missed out on an entire moon of training, and it was hard not to think about how far that may have set her back. She had been expecting to receive her warrior name within the next couple of moons, but now the young molly wasn’t so sure. All she could do now was play catch up and hope that her clan would notice all of her hard work and determination to get to where she needed to be. 

Her first hunting trip had been a bit touch and go given her lack of physical activity over the last moon and due to the layer of snow that now covered the forest. It hadn’t made for ideal hunting conditions, but when the golden pelted fem returned to ThunderClan’s camp she had not returned empty pawed. Her attempt to catch a squirrel had unfortunately failed, but she supposed the two mice that now dangled from her jaws swinging to and fro by their tails made up for that. She hated to admit that she had gotten a little rusty, but at least she hadn’t entirely lost her ability to feed her clan. 

Dropping her catch on the fresh-kill pile she turned towards the outskirts of the camp, leaving small imprints in the snow as she walked. She headed for the group of flat rocks that the elders typically used to sunbathe. Except there was no sun today, only gray skies and the promise of more snow, leaving them unoccupied for the time being. She brushed some of the snow off of the smooth surface with a forepaw, clearing away an area for her to sit. And there she sat, watching her clanmates going about their day as if disaster had never struck their clan. A small smile upturned the edges of her lips. It was overall a very peaceful leaf-bare day. <span class="mention" title="AIMSIR#9490">@cobra</span></span>

Gullypaw quickly followed the molly outside, getting the sensation of the sun on his fur and the brightness of outside the den over with and adjusted to quickly. It had been a while since he saw the brightness and bustle of the ThunderClan camp recently and only just now found himself lucky to have this verdant jungle of a territory. As a little kitten he had taken this for granted, as did plenty of other cats most likely. Oculars the hue of ripe pears, his large irises darted over to look at the beige-and-brown molly, meeting her lovely sunshine amber gaze for a moment before letting his own eyes drip to the ground. <strong>&quot;Erm, yes, it is.&quot;</strong>

As the pale molly queried about his favorite pasttime, his ears seemed to prick up, his eyes ripping off of the ground to look at Wrenpaw like peeling the fur off a warm piece of prey. A shy smile graced the dark tabby&#39;s visage and he gave a final glance at the ground before trying to make eye contact. <strong>&quot;Ah, yes, the clover crowns. My favorite spot to make them is outside camp, but we might have to ask to go outside, since all of the recent stuff, and, y&#39;know..&quot;</strong> He trailed off, not sure what to say next. That, and a dark flicker surfaced in the globes of his eyes, something like rememberance, but much more hurtful.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The morning had come swiftly, the aubades of dawn singing ardently across the camp. The phosphorescence of the fiery sun had replaced the white lumine of yesteryear. Although this change had been welcome, she had sometimes longed for the aegis that the cloak of night had served her with. It was a time to get away, a time to recollect your bearings and prepare for what the next day had to offer. But sometimes they didn’t give you that time to prepare. Sometimes, sadly enough, dawn fell quick upon midnight’s heels, covering it’s tracks. She had felt herself, over the moons, become more and more fond of the night and it’s happenings. Although some used it as a getaway from the goings-on of their life, she found it to be quite the opposite. It was cold, but the type of cold that brought you in curiously like it was a friend that was willing to listen to your problems and try to help you through them. Like a little angel on your shoulder, curiously enough. 

Her silhouette was like a pinprick against the blazing glory of the sunlight but, if you squinted hard enough, you could make her out. There she sat, always at the dawn of a new day. This was routine for her, to sit there and wait potentially until someone came up to her. Yet this time was different. This time, she was waiting for someone very specific to walk up to her. After all, training didn’t begin until both of the parties were awake. That’s just how it worked. So she waited, preparing to stand up if need called for it.

Training with Astermoon kept his mind off of Hollyfrost. Some days, being so preoccupied, he&#39;d forget about her passing, and rush home to tell her about his day. It was only when he&#39;d pad into the warriors den and see her nest missing and no scent of her around, would it hit him.

Today wasn&#39;t one of those days. Astermoon instructed him to work on duties in camp today, instead of being out in the forest. Foxpaw wasn&#39;t happy, but he knew better than to chat back, especially with his mother as leader. Laurelstar could be seriously scary when she was mad. He didn&#39;t want to be on the other side of her sharp tongue anytime soon. 

As he emerged from the elders den, clumps of moss and ferns stuck in his fur, the apprentice spotted a lounging Wrenpaw. They&#39;d spoken as kittens. She&#39;d assured him that Icestar would make him an apprentice. Foxpaw approached the other apprentice with a smile on his face. 

<strong>&quot;Hi Wrenpaw&quot;</strong> At least he sounded somewhat chipper now, compared to his previous moods. <strong>&quot;How are you doing today?&quot;</strong>

The skies were a muted tone of blue today, even with the sun not obscured by the presence of feathery clouds, as was common this time of year. The first snowfall had occurred during the night, but it was light, and hardly even coated the ground with a small layer of frost. The season was only beginning, however, and she knew it would only grow more harsh as time went on. They had to make sure the dens were reinforced and ready for the season, especially after the battle and the landslide derailed much of their repair efforts. They had gotten started earlier on, but it was not finished yet.

<em>So much work to do, and too little time.</em>

The russet-toned tortoiseshell sovereign had been caught up in so much work around camp that she had nearly forgotten to stop and take a breather. She was type to allow herself to get engrossed within her work, not stopping until the job was done, but this was too much for a single cat to work on alone— and thankfully there were other cats around to help in the efforts of repairing their camp, and she’d get back to work once her break was over. Even if she was leader of ThunderClan, she still had her part to play in handling duties around camp. From here, she could oversee the efforts of repairing camp and keep track of what needed to be completed still.

Essentially, she was idling for now.

Sunkit was awake early in the morning as Swiftstorm was still sleeping in the nursery. She flicked her ears in the direction towards the nursery entrance as she heard other cats outside. She got up from where she was sleeping and stretched as she walks to the entrance of the nursery. She pokes her head out in to the camp and looks around as she looks over at the other cats that were awake. She took a step out of the nursery but didn&#39;t move far from the entrance in case that Swiftstorm did wake up. She then noticed Laurelstar who seemed to be taking a break and was also watching the other cats who were repairing the dens for leafbare.

Her quiet observation at the current state of camp had led to the conclusion that they were a little over halfway finished. Some dens were almost fully reinforced, namely the nursery and the elders’ den, as they housed those who were most susceptible to the effects of the frigid zephyrs of leaf-bare. In fact, one of said individuals was toddling out of the nursery right about now, and it didn’t take long for the leader’s gaze to meet hers. Laurelstar flashed the kit a small smile, her bushy tail swaying as she sat up a bit, trying to appear regal and poised. Essentially trying to make herself appear cool to the kit, like she wasn’t taking a few seconds to  herself. This would be a good distraction before she needed to return to her duties.

<strong>”Hello Sunkit, are you wandering into camp by yourself?”</strong> the leader greeted the young she-kit with a softer tone, one she typically reserved for the younger members of her clan. It was a great juxtaposition to her outward appearance, rugged, battle-scarred, <em>gigantic</em>, she practically made the kits look like ants wherever she made her presence! Though it didn’t stop most of them from approaching her, she made it known she loved to spend time with the kits of ThunderClan. She always had.

Sunkit looks up at the gigantic leader as she was caught going out of the nursery. <strong>&quot;Just for a quick peak since there&#39;s a lot of noise going on.&quot;</strong> The young she kit mews softly as she didn&#39;t know hardly anyone in camp not even the other kits in the nursery since most of them keep to themselves.

The frigidly cold morning had crept upon the new day like icy claws. Icicles hung down like glass stalactites from the long, slender branches of the oaks and beeches and the dawn was silent and grayed except for the sweet birdsong that graced the camp. The sun had finally come out to play from its gray cloak of the wintry clouds and brandished its luminescence onto the camp, glistering wonderfully onto the snow powdered atop the pale, spiky grass underpaw like millions of fireflies ready to take flight from the ground. Still, most felids chose to lie dormant in their warm dens, some cats piled atop one another or pressing together for warmth in the chilly environment. The kits nestled at the queens&#39; bellies and the elders all snored gently near each other. And for the apprentices...well, all but one lone tom was missing.

A dark tabby tom, small and slender, slipped out of the den, still in the middle of stretching out his legs and smoothing down his fur, which still had scraps of moss clinging to it. He padded out gingerly into the snow - it was the first leafbare he could remember, so the sight of the camp sprinkled with frozen dew and snow was quite awebringing. It felt cold and stung a little on his soft pawpads, which were beginning to grow callouses from being out. This was his first training session since he had chosen to sit in his den and grieve for his lost grandmother, and do nothing else. He swallowed. Hopefully Smokingshore wasn&#39;t waiting too long on him.

It clumped at the fur between his pawpads and made his ankles slick and sodden, but to get to his training session he sort of had to make his way through this. He was relieved to see his mentor sitting serenely, only a fox-length or two away from where he stood now. Walking awkwardly in the snow, Gullypaw approached the dark she-cat, his apple-green irises sparkling with anticipation. <strong>&quot;Did I keep you too long?&quot;</strong> he asked her softly, cautioning himself to be quiet. <strong>&quot;I-I...erm, I&#39;m ready when you are..&quot;</strong></span>

The morning had been boreal, the breezes that had pranced through had made the air borderline algid, but there, flickering slightly in the darkness ahead, was the tiniest bit of warmth that cascaded through her body. Slowly, carefully, that feeling spread like a blanket would over a shivering child, chilled to the bone by the winter’s forthcomings. But she was no child, and the chill in her bones was from nothing more than her own antiquity. Although she was well into her older years now, she couldn’t help but long for the feeling of being a child again. The curiosity that came with it. But, as the saying goes, there were always two sides to the same coin. Her childhood had been her kryptonite. It was something she had kept locked away in the back of her mind, kept clandestine for moons to come. Family had never been her forte, after all. Not since the incident. And she remembered that night well. Raining. It had been raining. She had heard the polemic from her nest that night, it had roused her. And so, she had tried to intervene, tried to get them to stop bickering amongst themselves. And then he struck. She could still feel the pain she first felt when he struck her. That was something that never went away.</span>

You couldn’t tell, thankfully, from the expression she had on, but it took her a second to regain her bearings. Verdigris flames locked target on the apprentice as his voice registered and a small smile crept upon her lips. <em><strong>”Not in the slightest. In fact, you’re right on time,”</strong></em> came her antiphon as she rose to all four paws, turning back to face him again. <em><strong>”Come along, I’m going to show you the territory,”</strong></em> again, her tone was even and gentle, a respectful flame lit in the back of her throat as she turned back, ready to begin their journey.

<strong>&quot;Oh, good.&quot;</strong> The apprentice let out a small breath of relief, a short exhale of air that billowed near his muzzle, only to flutter away the slightest before disappearing with a swirl. <strong>&quot;Yes, Smokingshore.&quot;</strong> Obediently, the apprentice offered her a respectful dip of his head, then followed her at an even pace as she got up and began to pad forward. The notion of bowing your head to your superior was one that Gracklequiver had taught him as a kitten. She had looked so excited for him to become an apprentice. It made him quite depressed to think about, but he tried waving the thought away before he let that familar feeling well up in the bottom lid of his eye. Luckily, nature gave him a reason to feel better, as a snowflake drifted down from above, landing perfectly on his nose before melting at the stark contrast of temperatures. In turn, it made the small tabby sneeze.

Embarrassed, he shook his head, letting out a small sniffle to clear out his nostrils. As Smokingshore led the way, he couldn&#39;t help but keep examining his surroundings. He never knew how cruel yet so beautiful leaf-bare could be, like a rose. It had its gorgeous, sweet-smelling petals, but the thorns were a different kind of story. Catching the slightest notion of his mentor glancing over at him, Gullypaw craned his neck to look at her for a moment, before turning his head away to look at some very pretty icicles. Then, a question surfaced in his mind. <strong>&quot;Hey, Smokingshore?&quot;</strong> he mewed softly, looking over at the dark-coated warrioress again. <strong>&quot;Is it always this pretty in leaf-bare?&quot;</strong>

He paused for a moment, watching his small paws turn up the snow under his steps, leaving nothing but an odd patterned trail of slush behind him. Then, he asked, <strong>&quot;Do you ever get tired of looking at it?&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The esoteric feline had a genuine affinity to the facets of nature no matter what part of it you were discussing with her. There was a certain unseen pulchritude to it that not many seemed to pick up on and it was one that she had revered dearly. At the apprentice’s inquest, the vaporous warioress felt herself slip into a macrocosm of thought, stalling for a second. That word the apprentice had used, pretty, had been subjective in terms of beauty. She had felt herself question the sanctity of the word many times prior, wondering if it still meant now what it had meant before. It was a term of endearment, now more than anything else. She had felt herself slip under this current before, the flux of meddling with intent to learn more. There had been a time, moons upon moons ago, where curiosity was only a mere idea, something people talked about in order to spark conversation. But now it was here. It was real and it was everything she had thought it would be. But alas, that feeling, as raw and visceral as it was, abated soon enough. She knew it would. All good feelings have to come to an end.</span>

He had asked her another question. Luckily for her, the mask change had been swift and quick so that no one could notice she was lost in her own mind again. <em><strong>”It is. Although pretty is an understatement, I think. Sublime,”</strong></em> she said, pausing to take a breath as she flicked her tail tip, the scar that resided at it’s base showing in the new sunlight. After a moment of blissful silence, she spoke again. <em><strong>”Do I tire of it? Not in the slightest. In fact, every time I go out, I seem to find something else to love about it,”</strong></em> her voice, then, had lost an edge of it’s gentleness but it had been replaced with a soft note of awe in terms of just how pretty the world really was. Sometimes we underestimate it’s beauty. Finally, the task at hand returned to the forefront of her mind once more and she raised a paw as if to start walking again, looking ahead but speaking one last time: <em><strong>”Now come along. I’ve got a lot to show you, and I’m sure you’ll marvel at it,”</strong></em> At least, she always did.

The leader could understand the young kit&#39;s curiosity at the happenings outside of the nursery. Such commotion wasn&#39;t commonplace within the confines of the quarry, chatter between warriors about construction as well as cooperation in organizing supplies for further use. Sunkit would come to understand in time, for this was the prime season for reinforcing the dens around camp. Her naivete was amusing to say the least.

<strong>&quot;Well, if the noise is bothering you, you can come by me and we can drown it out by talking. I don&#39;t mind hanging out.&quot;</strong>

The ThunderClan leader had made it a habit in the past to be approachable, despite her would-be scary exterior to kits who considered her a stranger. Kits who might think she&#39;d eat them for breakfast, kits who thought she&#39;d turn them to stone with one mean glare. It couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth, for kits at least. <strong>&quot;The warriors are fixing the dens up so they are nice and warm for leaf-bare, the nights get very cold so we need to prepare so everyone stays safe. Including you.&quot;</strong>

Gullypaw gazed up at his alluring cat of a mentor as she opened her  sleek, small jaws to respond. Hearing her smoky yet sweetened voice sent a tingle down his spine - he felt lucky to have such a molly for his mentor. He felt as if she was too good for just little old him. Was that weird? Blushing a bit from his own consciousness, Gullypaw fought with himself internally, trying to decide on a determinate subject to think about. He was so submerged in his hurricane of introspections that it made him jump when Smokingshore spoke once more. He felt guilt for not listening before, a sea of clashing emotions in his mind palace making him dizzy all of a sudden, but it all was erased when she recited another sentence. <em>I&#39;ve got a lot to show you, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll marvel at it.</em> His heart quickened, excitement welling in his heart and reaching his face, where a blossoming expression of energy reached his features. When he was happy, he looked much better. Such a smile so sweet was in need of protectment - the giver himself was blind to his own beauty.

I mean, I&#39;ve never...&quot;</strong> As they trekked on in the blanket of white, snow clumping &#39;round their ankles and their toes sodden and frozen, Gullypaw once again gazed down at the ground, a little too embarrassed to meet Smokingshore&#39;s glistering irises. <strong>&quot;I know you&#39;re my mentor and all, but...No one has really, erm, <em>invited</em> me like that...I, it&#39;s nice, but I can&#39;t help feeling a little weird...uuu, my chest is getting warm.&quot;</strong> He mumbled that last muse to himself, feeling his cheeks redden. Smokingshore must think he was an idiot now. That, or that he was depraved of socialization. To which, that wasn&#39;t awfully incorrect. Wrenpaw, the beige and brown apprentice and a denmate of his, was the one to finally comfort him in his ocean of sorrows that he was drowning in, and he felt completely estranged from that feeling of warmth at first. It made him anxious to think that he was different from the others. All he wanted was a normal life. Was that so much to ask for...?

Gullypaw shook his head. Maybe he was just....overthinking. This was his first training session since Gracklequiver had passed away protecting him. He needed to stay calm. Maybe if he got through this, everything would eventually go back to normal. He&#39;d learn more. He&#39;d grow. Maybe, just maybe make a friend or two. He wanted to make his grandmother proud of him. But how could he ever do that if he kept dwelling on the past? But...he couldn&#39;t just forget what happened. The leer in the demonic spirit&#39;s eyes, Gracklequiver&#39;s scream doused with her own ichor, and the sickening thud of her body at the ground. The carmine liquid spattering his paws....

No. Stop that. Stop thinking about it. Gullypaw huffed, a small cloud of air puffing out near his nose. He decided he&#39;d try and keep calm today and relax. He needed to, if he were to ever progress. He had to do it, for his future.

       Stepping beyond the borders of clan camp was now something the Bengal-Savannah feline had to think about before doing so. No longer a <em>should he?</em> but a <em>could he?</em> Patrols were sent out - it was a peculiar feeling; being able to tell what his former equals should do. To <em>order</em> them about. There was a hunting patrol sent out with a couple of cats, they should be fine. He could have helped but not there was an anchor keeping him here. He was an asset that simply can not go out and frolic. And so, the multicoloured masculine kept in his spot, pale manus disturbing the snow beneath as his weight shifted from one column to another. 
    But on the topic otherwise, the bachelor had intentions with reconnecting with individuals he had not in a long time shared a conversation with for a while. One of which was MarigoldDust. It was a significant point to be made that to this bachelor - it felt like yesterday that he helped the feline in the hunters crouch and such as a kit to prepare for apprenticeship. Time flew. It waited for nobody. And naturally, like anyone else could have, Alerce did sometimes put pause on his own life. He needed a breather. He needed to let days, weeks, and maybe even moons go by in a blur. His head was underwater. Today, breathing had never felt so great.

       The xanthippe let the little shimmer of affection curse her harlequin gander as she watched the small thing struggle. This Thunderclanner was no sadistic individual to find pleasantries in anothers&#39; struggle, but more the development of kit. The adventurous ambition they put themselves through, like every other kit did. Like SwiftStorm herself did. 
    <strong>&quot;Ooh,&quot;</strong> A waver of her dimensional tail and the madame strode to the fresh kill pile. <strong>&quot;Perfect; a vole.&quot;</strong> It was a good starter. Small meal and tender flesh, the striated duchess took this back to Sunkit to shorten their labored journey and set it down gently at their paws. <strong>&quot;Here, take a bite. Try it, it&#39;s good!&quot;</strong> She urged with a tear at the exterior to free Sunkit from the struggle of biting through the fur and skin.</span>

That lazy cat was none other than Brownstripe. His muscular features told others he was disciplined and diligent; but, when it came to waking up, his muscles did him no good. Looking away from the sunlight and gathering up all the warmth from the sun only strengthened his resolve to not move from his position. 

<em>No. Get up! Get up you stupid mousebrain. You got things to do. Get up! Get the hell up!</em> Like always, his more sensible side of his mind betrays his will to sleep again. Getting up was a struggle and the strong muscles he had worked so hard to gain did nothing to help him as he stumbled a bit to gain balance. <em>Come on. A warrior never accepts defeat. A warrior never quits.</em> He told himself and turns towards the entrance, which was a bad idea. <em>My eyes! Holy mother of- My eyes! ARGH.</em> The brown tabby quickly covers his eyes with one paw and walks out of the den. Fortunately, his eyes adjusted to the brightness of the day and he was able to examine the camp to see if anything new was occurring.

       Darkness was a concept many touched for the sake of exterior understanding, but only to abandon it without further chase. Few delved further into the concept of this subject to beyond simply the exterior and taste the bitter interior of it. There was more to the absence of light than the colours and antics. But of course, further analyzing would offer the exercised truths and theories that darkness was actually not as literal as light. Darkness - despite being the genesis of everything, was more illustrative than light. A powerful opposite nonetheless. 
    This polychromatic combatant himself had risen with the sun. It was nothing more of a habit for the bachelor apart from finding the need to escape dreams no matter their luxurious value. Alerce was a self sabotaging individual so much so that he often envied the effortless self respect others had of letting themselves sleep in even as the sun climbing higher from the horizon. Eventually they all filed up a few hours after the sun bent long shadows across the campsite from the treetops. One included Brownstripe - to Alerces fortune being of spirit to go hunting with, even if they seemed to be temporarily distracted by the bright light of day. The sun was usually strongest in leaf bare after all.
<strong>&quot;BrownStripe,&quot;</strong> Authority and confidence rippled from the demeanor of this newly appointed deputy. <strong>&quot;Let&#39;s go hunting,&quot;</strong> The warrior needed to wake up after all and a hunting expedition often did the trick.</span>

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Change... it was an idea that Marigolddust had grown to dislike quite strongly.  It always brought misfortune with it, despite the occasional good that came as a result of it&#39;s visit, and was never a comfortable thing.  Yet, even with this strong opinion, he couldn&#39;t stop it.  The only cats that could were the ones who were walking above his head, although the light of the sun had brought them into hiding.  Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t seem to think it was very important to stop all of the misfortune that had managed to find Thunderclan.  Instead, they let more and more of it come to the camp, hitting the cats who were a part of the group with more trouble than they had had for moons.  Marigolddust wasn&#39;t an acceptation to this; if anything, he might have been one of the cats who had had to go through the most change.  

                   Going from a warrior residing in the medicine cat&#39;s den to the medicine cat himself was one of the biggest alterations, along with the fact that he had to deal with not having his best friend by his side anymore.  Every time he thought too hard on where Fernpaw might be or whether she would return, his heart ached, serving to be more painful than it was worth.  Yet, he couldn&#39;t stop himself from wondering.  Had she joined Starclan?  Why hadn&#39;t she visited him in his dreams yet?  She could do that now, couldn&#39;t she?  Or was she restricted?  Or... or did she not want to see him?</span>

The grey tuxedo&#39;s muzzle wrinkled as he scowled at himself.  He shouldn&#39;t be occupied with these thoughts- he had to focus on the now, and that &quot;now&quot; needed as much attention as he could give it.  Leaf-bare had hit the forest clans, and he was less than unprepared.  Raising a paw, he gently tried to wipe the stressed thoughts out of his mind.  Okay, so, what was his plan today?  Slowey, he looked around his den and at the decrease in patients that occupied it&#39;s nests.  Well, that was a good sign, and it meant that he had the chance to collect as many herbs as he could.  Although, how many6 he would be able to find at this time of the year, he wasn&#39;t sure.  His chest began to ache as anxiety crawled deeper and deeper inside of it, making it feel as if some sort of infection he had yet to learn about had plagued him.  He took in a deep breath in the hopes to get rid of it and stood from where he was.  The least he could do was try and find any herbs, right?  Right.  Yes, that was what he would do.  But he couldn&#39;t go alone.  He had learned that lesson when Wolfprowl had had to save him from the dog that had ambushed him while he had been searching for catnip.  So, he might he be able to bother to join him?</span>

              A certain cat had been on the young medicine cat&#39;s mind ever since the last meeting that Laurelstar had brought together.  Alerceclaw was a cat he knew, or at least used to know, and had once looked up to.  Ever since he had become an apprentice, though, the two hadn&#39;t really spoken, and things had become a little... awkward, between them.  Now, the same warrior who had taught him how to do the hunters crouch for the first time was the next in line to take Laurelstar&#39;s place.  Conversing with the new deputy was nearly inevitable, not matter how reluctant Mariglddust had been to approach a conversation that would surely be as awkward as he expected it to be.  Alerceclaw was a good cat, of course, and Marigolddust liked to consider the two to be on good terms, but he was never the best cat at solving situations that weren&#39;t the most comfortable.  If anything, he always managed to make it even worse.  What type of reintroduction would that be?  A terrible one, that was for sure, yet he couldn&#39;t prevent it.  Maybe inviting the deputy to join him on a herb-gathering trip would give them a good opportunity to talk.  Although, it hadn&#39;t seemed like Alerceclaw had been very intent on leaving the camp ever since he had earned his new rank.</span>

                   <em>What if he doesn&#39;t accept?</em>  Marigolddust thought quietly to himself, hesitating for just a moment, rather than taking the first step out of his den.  Well, if he didn&#39;t accept, that would be fine.  Marigolddust could spare a few moments that he could spend preventing the problems he would certainly encounter later in the season... yes, of course he could.  If it turned out necessary, Marigolddust could just act like he was talking to a patient.  That always made the whole preventing-awkwardness thing work- well, usually.  Taking in a deep breath once more, Marigolddust finally managed to get himself to pad out of his den and into the outside world.  

                    The first thing that hit him was the cold.  Almost immediately, Marigolddust shivered, unable to hold back his distaste for the low temperatures.  Being chilly was yet another thing he didn&#39;t enjoy very much, and yet another thing that Leaf-bear brought him.  Carefully, he raised his paw, trying to wipe off what snow had clung to his paw pads before taking another step, only gaining more snow in his fur.  He had forgotten how hard it was to avoid the snow, and despite how magical it seemed, he found himself sighing, disappointed.  Well, he would have to try and warm himself again once he got back to his den... which, surprisingly, was much warmer than the camp, having had multiple cats inside to provide it with body heat.  Squinting, Marigolddust looked away from his paw and to the bright environment that displayed itself in front of him.  The sunlight that bounced off of the white surface of the snow was blinding, but he just managed to catch sight of familiar tuxedo fur.  <em>Alright, this is it,</em> he thought, biting his tongue nervously as he slowly made his way to the older tom.  <em><strong><em>&quot;Um... hey Alerceclaw,&quot;</em></strong></em> he greeted, giving the warrior a sheepish, perhaps a bit nervous, smile.  <em><strong><em>&quot;How are you today?&quot;</em></strong></em>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Brownstripe had two choices: to spend his time in solitude or go out and make more friends. Because he was more of an extrovert, one choice had a mountain of more votes than the other. The previous lethargy he had quickly washed away when he felt the excitement of going hunting on his own. Today was the day he was going to surprise Thunderclan by securing the largest amount of prey any warrior could ever hunt. It was a challenge he gave to himself to maintain his motivation to support the clan with food during leafbare. Unexpectedly, all of that motivation was lost when he heard his name called.

&quot;<strong>What!?</strong>&quot; He shouts with an annoyed voice and turns to the cat who said his name. Immediately, he straightens his back and moves to the position of attention. <em>Oh snap.</em> It was the deputy himself and the foolish brown tabby had just yelled at him. &quot;<strong>Oh it&#39;s you, Alerceclaw! Oh... Well let&#39;s go hunting! Great idea!</strong>&quot; He laughs sheepishly. Of course, he had to start off the day snapping at the new deputy. What else can go wrong? What other shenanigans could he accidentally do that would further dig himself deeper into the rabbit hole of unrelenting failure?

Blue and Green optics widened, filled with curiosity as he looked up at the barrier. He was relieved that they finally arrived but he had to fight his shivering body to stay standing. The last thing he wanted was to collapse in front of the powerful leader. Bandit took his mind off his aching body to listen to Laurelstar, nodding along with what she was saying. <strong>&quot;Wait. I can decide to stay?&quot;</strong> He questioned as if he had heard her wrong. He had no clue what it meant to be a clan cat, so the thought of everyone accepting him seemed impossible. Would he even want to stay? He supposed he would just have to wait and see. Even if he did decide he wanted to stay, it was not his say in the end anyways.

The tom looked towards the camps entrance, his mind now racing with endless outcomes. <strong>&quot;Alright. Sounds fair enough... I&#39;m ready.&quot;</strong> Bandit watched Laurelstar walk through before taking in a deep breath, then following. 

The scent of Thunderclan quickly became overpowering as they descended the tunnel, his cold nose twitching as he took it all in. His ears stood high, the commotion growing louder, then finally many cats came across his vision as they entered into the camp. His eyes grew wide as he took in his new surroundings. <strong>&quot;I&#39;ve never seen so many cats in one place before!&quot;</strong> He stated more to himself as he marveled. Bandit&#39;s amazement quickly dwindled however as the tiny tom started to notice a few pairs of eyes on him. He suddenly felt small under the burning gazes, his own eyes shying away and down to his paws. He hoped he would make a good first impression.</span>

Wrenpaw craned her neck around to gently groom around the wounds that etched her flanks, cleaning the golden fur around it but careful not to lick them directly. Though mostly healed, the fresh scar tissue was still quite tender and sore to the touch. Still, Wrenpaw was glad she didn’t have to worry about accidentally reopening them anymore. It made training, hunting, and the rest of her apprentice duties much easier. She had tuned out her surroundings, so when Foxpaw greeted her she flinched quite violently, her amber eyes stretched wide as they fell upon his face. She laughed it off, feeling a bit embarrassed at being so startled by a greeting from her denmate. <strong>”Oh, hi, Foxpaw! Sorry, I guess I’m a bit jumpy these days,”</strong> she said. Of course, the apprentice had every good reason to be so on edge. It was often hard to remind herself that she was safe now, and no cat was out to get her. 

She hadn’t spoken to Foxpaw since they had both been kits, and she was rather pleased that he had decided to come and talk to her. It would be nice to catch up with someone she considered an old friend. Of course, Wrenpaw considered nearly every cat she met a friend. <strong>”I’m doing…”</strong> she paused, her features looking almost thoughtful for a brief moment before she continued. <strong>”Good. I’m good,”</strong> she concluded with a little smile. It had been a while since she had been able to say that and actually mean it. She had been fortunate enough not to lose any cat close to her during the battle, although she was well aware that not many cats in the clan had been so lucky. Wrenpaw had recovered physically, and mentally she was working on putting everything behind her. 

<strong>”How about you?”</strong> She reciprocated the question with a slight tilt of her head, still sporting her usual cheerful smile. <strong>”It looks like you’ve been hard at work,”</strong> she mused, noting the moss and fern pieces clinging to his pelt. <span class="mention" title="AIMSIR#9490">@cobra</span></span>

The leader of ThunderClan had returned to camp with a new face in tow, but she did not appear fearful or on edge. She was leading the young tom into her camp willingly, and she was shooting her clanmates a look that indicated there was no threat from the stranger’s scent that was flooding their senses. She nodded to the former kittypet who had been following after her to make his appearance in camp, watching as he entered her home with an awestruck expression upon his features. He already was drawing more attention to himself, and it gave the leader some reason for concern. She might have to act as a flesh shield for the poor thing if she wasn’t careful in how he was introduced. Still, she was the ThunderClan leader here, she’d tell them not to tear him apart.

<strong>”Hey! Hey! Don’t look at him like that, he’s staying with us for a while. My orders, he’s to be trained with the other apprentices.”</strong> she growled out towards some of the more hostile-appearing figures she could spot, her bushy tail lashing around behind her as she stood her ground. Better to assert herself in her decision now, she wasn’t going to let <em>another</em> dead kittypet show up in camp. It’d be strange for it to have happened twice, totally morbid.

<strong>”Welcome to ThunderClan’s camp, Bandit. The apprentice’s den over there is where you will be staying for now.”</strong> the brawny tortoiseshell pointed to the cave that made up the apprentice’s den on the opposite wall from where they stood, her scowl being replaced with an easygoing smile. <strong>”As for you wanting to stay, its a matter of whether you feel as if you’d like to join our clan— but its not that simple. It’d mean you’d swear loyalty to us and the Warrior Code we abide by. Betrayal and treason are high crimes here, I highly suggest you do not break our trust.”</strong> her voice grew increasingly more bitter, but she was not going to reveal the fact her clan had practically torn itself apart when traitors were discovered amongst their ranks— and was the reason why she was even leader now in the first place. They had forced her predecessor to give up her lives in exchange for her own, but she was thankful Iceheart was alive… Even if she couldn’t remember her, she wished she could help her regain what she had lost from her incredible sacrifice. <strong>”Again, if you wish to stay, it is not a guarantee. I will allow my clanmates a say in the matter. Though many of them have come from outside our borders, you are hardly the first kittypet we’ve had join our ranks. Just prove yourself and I’m sure they’ll accept you… If you want to stay, of course. Again, no pressure.”</strong>

<em>After losing five grown warriors, we need all the strength we can get. I need to get our apprentices trained and ready for battle in case we need to defend ourselves this season.</em>

       The xanthippe let the little shimmer of affection curse her harlequin gander as she watched the small thing struggle. This Thunderclanner was no sadistic individual to find pleasantries in anothers&#39; struggle, but more the development of kit. The adventurous ambition they put themselves through, like every other kit did. Like SwiftStorm herself did. 
    <strong>&quot;Ooh,&quot;</strong> A waver of her dimensional tail and the madame strode to the fresh kill pile. <strong>&quot;Perfect; a vole.&quot;</strong> It was a good starter. Small meal and tender flesh, the striated duchess took this back to Sunkit to shorten their labored journey and set it down gently at their paws. <strong>&quot;Here, take a bite. Try it, it&#39;s good!&quot;</strong> She urged with a tear at the exterior to free Sunkit from the struggle of biting through the fur and skin.                    </span>

Sunkit had made it out of the nursery as she was following Swiftstorm and kept pawing at the snow as it made a crunch like sound. She enjoyed the sound but stopped and looked up towards her adopted mother who dropped at vole at her paws. She sniffs it as this was her first time having an actual piece of prey and bit into the crimson colored meat. She purrs as she was enjoying the piece she had in her mouth and some of the crimson liquid had gotten on the kits fur which she didn&#39;t pay no mind to.

The leader could understand the young kit&#39;s curiosity at the happenings outside of the nursery. Such commotion wasn&#39;t commonplace within the confines of the quarry, chatter between warriors about construction as well as cooperation in organizing supplies for further use. Sunkit would come to understand in time, for this was the prime season for reinforcing the dens around camp. Her naivete was amusing to say the least.

<strong>&quot;Well, if the noise is bothering you, you can come by me and we can drown it out by talking. I don&#39;t mind hanging out.&quot;</strong>

The ThunderClan leader had made it a habit in the past to be approachable, despite her would-be scary exterior to kits who considered her a stranger. Kits who might think she&#39;d eat them for breakfast, kits who thought she&#39;d turn them to stone with one mean glare. It couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth, for kits at least. <strong>&quot;The warriors are fixing the dens up so they are nice and warm for leaf-bare, the nights get very cold so we need to prepare so everyone stays safe. Including you.&quot;</strong>

The kit had gotten up from where she was sitting at the entrance of the nursery and accepted the invitation the leader gave to her. She walks over to the larger she-cat as she sits next to Laurelstar. The kit wasn&#39;t in the slightest scared of the leader as she listens to what she was saying. <strong>&quot;What about the apprentices don&#39;t they help with the dens also?&quot;</strong> The young she-kit asked as she tilted her head a bit to the side.

       Change. Seemed to be the topic of things recently despite this individuals antipathy towards the subject. <em>Change</em>. He was force fed this subject matter by the nauseating heaping spoonful. It was constant and persistent. And there was no stopping - Alerce had come to realize early on. There was no stopping because otherwise you were dragged by the bullet train of time. So it was either being dragged till your character was no longer familiarized to you, or scrambling to keep up - or <em>try</em> to keep up. And only recently had this bachelor come to terms with himself. Stay one step ahead. Sleepless nights and overthought actions resulting in staying one step ahead. Was it worth it? Possibly. Because here he was; one step ahead and deputy of Thunderclan. Change. Twas a fickle creature.
    The sun had climbed up from the horizon now capable of watching over its realm. To which Alerce had only acknowledged with a simply glance, but of course, one could not simply stare at the sun. The bright rays mocked its contestant until the oddly patterned gladiator lowered his gaze elsewhere. An eventful morning, vigorous potent had only now settled into camp, rolling his scalpulae to release any bothersome knots from solitude patrol. There was a vital point to patrolling alone in contrast to patrolling with a coterie of others. Although it was a less persistent preference today than it was before.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The previous leader; IceStar had made sure to open his mind on cooperation with the cat amongst the clan. Cooperation and dependence on others. His worries no longer lay on them making far too much noise but instead, them getting injured. Development in his psyche wasa gradual, impressive journey. But alas, what had instigated this flexible behavior? In a perfect world, he would mention MarigoldDust. But Mari had only been a fraction of the trigger to this form of development. Mari had offered the weighted prominence of the new generation and considered amaranthine patience. Patience that eventually prolonged their interaction to eventually none at all. The two had not spared either a word for a long time. The now medicine cat had earned his place in the ranks sooner than Alerce had - and by all means, the tuxedo deserved it. Just as the day Alerce witnessed his promotion, he still believed Mari deserved it. Showing dedication and nix of despondency. Marigold was an ambitious feline all his life. Almost made it seems as if the position was made him rather than the other way around. So of course, them sharing the trilateral clan ranks, speaking with the medicine cat was ineluctable. 

    <span class="pre pre--inline">&quot;Hey AlerceClaw,&quot;</span> Speak of the devil. The swivel of this sires cranial function was met with the subject in psyche. <em>MarigoldDust</em>. 
<strong>&quot;MarigoldDust,&quot;</strong> Being deputy did not give him an excuse not to still respectfully dip his head to the other. The position much taken for granted, Mari had the knowledge to save a life. Killing was not a tough task - as rare as it was.</span>

       The was once a time Alerce had seriously considered  either choices to oppose the other. <em>To spend his time in solitude or to go out and made more friends</em>. His life has leaked into every possibly crevice of personality it could to finally settle into the one he had now. Stability. Thank Starclan for it. It was the figurative act of tasting all forms of sustenance to finally settle on one. Development. One simply could not escape it. The vanguard of obfuscated jurisdiction above sure did like to mold the mortals down below.
    <span class="pre pre--inline">&quot;What?&quot;</span> Snappiness was a dreadful sound from others. Alerce&#39;s crown tilted and not the physiognomy of sheepishness nor question appeared on his features but stern dislike of the tone. Even if he weren&#39;t deputy, the toms response was inadequate. But he <em>was</em> deputy and this response only offered even more weighted dislike.
<strong>&quot;Surely you don&#39;t talk to your fellow clanmates like that,&quot;</strong> He urged the others acceptance to hunt with a flick of his tail, turning to head to beyond the camp grounds. His intonation however lacked amusement, severe emphasis on the situation turned to BrownStripe.

Outside of camp? A pondering expression took over Wrenpaw’s features for a moment, honey colored gaze drifting towards the camp entrance. Apprentices hadn’t been allowed out of the camp on their own since the warriors had been trapped inside after the landslide. Wrenpaw had never been one for breaking rules, and she wasn’t about to start now. Still, there was probably no harm in them going outside of camp if they stayed close. <strong>”Well, there is a place just outside where we sometimes gather moss for new nests. It’s within view of the camp entrance, so I’m sure it would be just fine. We could collect some moss for the elders! They’d really appreciate that. We could get clovers there too and just bring them back with us,”</strong> she suggested. It sounded like a good idea, and the molly didn’t think they’d get in any trouble for it either. It would only take them away from camp for a brief while. 

Her smile faded as she watched his gaze darken, and she knew he was thinking about his grandmother. She had never known Gracklequiver personally, but it was no secret that the pair had been very close. She gave him a sympathetic look, taking a few steps to stand at his side and resting her tail comfortingly over his shoulders. <strong>”We don’t have to go out. I’m sure there’s plenty of fun things we can do right here in the safety of the camp,”</strong> she purred cheerfully.

Life had more or less returned to normal since the various tragedies the clan had faced not too long ago. Though there were still lingering emotions concerning that which was lost, their lives were a lot calmer and more peaceful, returning to a more stable time. Mismatched eyes peered from the nursery entrance as she glanced back to view her litter for a moment, before padding out into the camp. Her tail swayed over the snowy earth, as she glanced about, settling down a short distance away in case something happened from within the nursery, it would make the potentially urgent trip rather quick though with her own two already a couple of moons old, she didn&#39;t have many worries over whether or not they&#39;d get in trouble. The others...that was a different story. A quiet breath escaped her as she returned her attention toward the camp before her, perhaps tossing about the idea of an interaction.

Calm violet hues explored the campsite with excitement. The blue she-cat had been off on her own terms for a few days, catching up with her kittypet uncle, Garfield and her new cousins. Her stubby, fluffy tail waved back and forth as she made her way back into camp, two rats hanging from her jaws. She spotted a resting queen nearby the nursery, and decided to share her spare kill. Her large paws treaded heavily along the murky earth as she made her way towards the sullen she, quietly setting the mouse down in front of her. &quot;Morning. Just caught these and you looked hungry.&quot; She chirped, settling down a few tail-lengths away from the queen. She wasn&#39;t familiar with this feline, but Wisteriacloud always appreciated company and her presence was quite pleasant to most. 

Plus- Wisteria loved kits, and making friends with the queens guaranteed her the ability to play with some cute kits in the future. Her tail curled over her paws as she looked down at her prey, stomach rumbling. <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span></span>

The behemoth let out a small yawn as she inspected the camp with heavy-lidded eyes. A lazy smile had planted itself upon her features as she felt herself relax a bit as she was speaking to the young kitten at her side. Idle chatter with someone no bigger than a rabbit, always entertaining to her. <strong>”Of course they do, but they also have training to focus on. This is secondary to that.”</strong> she nodded, answering the kit’s question with a flick of her tail. She could see a few gathering supplies for the warriors around camp, but for the most part, an apprentice’s duty was to train so they could become a warrior one day. They needed as many as they could get now that they were down <em>eight</em> of them.

<em>Great StarClan… I still can’t wrap my head around losing so many cats at once.</em>

The battle had wrought death and destruction upon their clan, and its wounds were still prevalent. Laurelstar had been trying to alleviate the problem, but it was proving to be quite the challenge. <strong>”So when you’re an apprentice, be sure to work extra hard in training, so you can get big and strong.”</strong> she chuckled quietly, trying to deflect the grim and morose feelings she was experiencing in this moment with humor, putting up a front that everything would be fine. Sunkit didn’t need to know more, she was too young.

To be honest, being among the nursery was quick to become less than desirable, exhausting even. Though the pointed molly did care for her offspring and loved them dearly, some days that old spirit would overwhelm her with desires to hunt and slay among the territory. Yet, she couldn&#39;t bear to leave her kits for that long - especially with having to nurse another litter alongside caring for her own biological two, things were quick to grow complicated. Fuchsiaburn allowed for a sigh to escape her, tattered tail twitching occasionally.
    Mismatched eyes caught sight of the approach of another feline, raising her head slightly as the warrior approached. Her whiskers quivered as a mouse was placed before her, a brow raising slightly as a greeting was spared from the other molly. Another thing she wasn&#39;t exactly fond of - being brought things she could easily get herself. <strong>&quot;Did I?&quot;</strong> she inquired sharply, eyes poised upon the warrior who stood before her. <strong>&quot;Well, I suppose I could use something to eat regardless, but I could&#39;ve easily gotten myself a morsel of prey myself.&quot;</strong> she added after a moment, tail lashing. <strong>&quot;Though, I appreciate your...generosity. How are you this morning?&quot;</strong> she inquired afterwards, tone softening a tad.

Gullypaw jerked a bit as Wrenpaw draped her tail over his shoulders, though quickly untensed. He appreciated her comforting words, but not all the dark swirls of rememberance vanished from his apple-green gaze. He wasn&#39;t really sure what to say at the moment, but didn&#39;t have the heart to excuse himself and leave, so he just gave her a tense nod, small claws flexing in the frozen ground. Frost was beginning to creep up the blades of grass and it made his paws quite sodden, but he wasn&#39;t going to let every little thing ruin his day. He had a habit of getting overwhelmed but since Wrenpaw was here he didn&#39;t wanna make it unpleasant for her. <strong>&quot;W-we can, er...&quot;</strong> Gullypaw trailed off, trying to think of things to do. He hadn&#39;t spent much time playing games with the other kits in the nursery - instead, he preferred sleeping or talking to Gracklequiver, who was basically his only friend. He had been too shy to actually participate so he didn&#39;t know of many games to play. 

But, one thing did come to mind, that he had discovered as a kitten. But he had it buried deep back in his memories. Dusting off the fragile memory and placing it back on the shelf, the visuals and sounds all popped back in his little mind, and he looked over to the tan and brown molly. <strong>&quot;I just thought of something. Here, this way.&quot;</strong> Gullypaw turned to the left and began padding quietly with his head held a little higher. They were proceeding to the nursery now, but not inside it - rather around it, to the back where it was more secluded. Bracken and undergrowth protruded from all sides, making it hard for the both of them to fit, but it didn&#39;t matter to Gullypaw. He was much more focused on the frost-rimed flowers in front of him, somehow still intact with white ice crystals specking their purple petals and olive leaves.

<strong>&quot;Here they are,&quot;</strong> Gullypaw said softly.</span>

The air was filled with a light chill as the zephyrs of leaf-bare had descended upon the clans like a frigid blight. The atmosphere at night felt thick, almost as if the very air they breathed had been frozen solid by the freezing temperatures that had made their debut at the start of this harsh season. While she, the ThunderClan leader, had survived many a leaf-bare, she knew others weren&#39;t so lucky. They did not have the thick coat she did, one that grew even more dense and long at the start of winter, one that shielded her from the cold for the most part. Hence why they had focused  on repairing the dens around camp, while the efforts had been wrapped up and completed, she still was the paranoid sort. Inspecting each and every den to ensure everyone was warm and safe from the elements, especially the kits of her clan. Laurelstar always had a soft spot for them.

The nursery had checked out to her standards, and she let out a sigh of relief. Normally her father would have had it ship shape a while ago, but since his passing it had fallen to her and the warriors of ThunderClan to keep up with its maintenance. She kept his legacy alive by looking after any and all kits she encountered, and she was glad his lessons of kindness towards those who could not defend themselves seemed to have a lasting impact upon the clan. She only wished she too could leave behind such an important legacy to uphold.

<em>Not soon though, I plan to lead this clan for a long time, and we still have a lot of healing to do. We will be strong.</em>

The kits were the foundation of their clan, the next generation they would pass the torch of leadership to, the ones who would inherit this clan from them. Thus it was important they prioritized their development and protection within these walls. Laurelstar would make sure the youths of her clan would become some of the greatest warriors the forest would ever know. They needed them now more than ever.

Sunkit looked up to the gigantic leader as she listens to the she-cat&#39;s words. <strong>&quot;I promise to do my best when I become an apprentice.&quot;</strong> the young she-kit said confidently to Laurelstar. She was mostly unaware of the fight that had happened in the camp since she was asleep in the nursery with Swiftstorm watching over her.

The night was dark. The shadows cut deep into the frost-rimed branches and the snow-blanketed grass, the air heavy with the bitter chill of leaf-bare. Though the twilight ether shone with the brilliance of Silverpelt up overhead, the moon was not present tonight. A thick sheet of fluffy, grayed clouds hogged the beauty of the darkened empyrean, shedding nothing but its silent tears onto the ground, only adding to the thick cloak of white that seemed to be neverending with leaf-bare. Even with the chilly weather, though, the cats of the Clans below found their way through the frozen barrier of winter. Soon enough, with the force of their calloused pads, this subzero wall, no longer glistening like ice, would crack and crack until they finally broke through to newleaf. Improvisations, though temporary, had been made - most warriors and apprentices slept pressed against one another for warm, and the queens, their young, and the elders all got the extra moss that could be found. Soft breathing emitted from the huts of the warriors and apprentices, as did the nursery with the milky scent stronger than ever. Gentle snores rasped through the air, the only noise that was just loud enough to break the hushed, almost eerie silence of midnight. Everyone was asleep. Or so, it was thought.

But, even though Laurelstar was trying her best to be silent, her activities did not go unnoticed. The eyelids of a small, cream tabby kitten, her markings akin to the unseeable stars shining overhead, slowly fluttered open, little ears swiveling slightly as the ragged song of snow underpaw funneled into her ears. <em>Now, who could that be?</em> the darling girl thought curiously in her head, mismatched gaze innocent. Glancing over at Palesheen and her siblings to make sure they stayed awake, the older kit rose from her resting spot, padding out hurriedly into the snow. Immediately a frigid breeze buffeted her downy coat, not one she could stand well, but something else had piqued her interest. A tall, lone figure, the blackened camoflage of night coating her fur. If she squinted, she could just make out darker markings. But, since not much could be seen, the little one decided she&#39;d go and investigate herself.

With a few steps forward, the snow soaking through her ankles, she asked with a voice so soft and delicate - <strong>&quot;Hello? Might anyone be there?&quot;</strong></span>

<em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

<em>Patience.</em>  It was a virtue that Margiolddust was fortunate enough to have, although so many cats weren&#39;t so lucky.  More often than not, Marigolddust could pick at least twice the amount of impatient cats as he could with patient ones, although he knew that doing such a thing might have been viewed as judgmental and rude, so he never actually did it, at least not on purpose.  Some cats were, clearly, less patient than others, and sometimes it was too apparent to be missed, even if you tried to.  One such impatient cat was Cloverpaw.  Despite how fond he was of her, he could never avoid the fact that he viewed her as a little... well, he would rather describe her as a fem who wasn&#39;t very interested in waiting for something to come when she could make it arrive faster.  Or, at least, that was what he had seen so far- he would never tell her about it, of course, and even if he did, he would make sure to add the fact that it could sometimes be enduring.  

                 But, personally, Marigolddust didn&#39;t exactly recognize the character trait in himself, neither patience or impatience.  He hadn&#39;t really thought of it much at all, and, in all honesty, would rather try and focus on others, rather than himself.  Perhaps it was his selflessness that made him so patient?  You had to wait for others to finish speaking or dealing with what life had in store for them, and he wasn&#39;t a cat who was going to interrupt the process.  Even so, it would be a lie if some cat said that he didn&#39;t have the virtue.  He sometimes made it much more clear than he intended to, and sometimes he used it without even realizing.  One such time was his and Alerceclaw&#39;s friendship.  After the warrior had taught him the hunters crouch as a kitten, Marigolddust had always wanted to try and locate Alerceclaw again and boast about how well he was doing, or how scared he had made his siblings... but it didn&#39;t work out that way.</span>

                 With changes came the earning and loosing of abilities, and one of the abilities that Marigolddust had lost becoming an apprentice was time.  He had never really had time to try and find Alerceclaw once his training had begun, and after he had lost his sister and his mother&#39;s neglect towards him and his remaining siblings began... well, it was difficult, to put it simply.  Most of the time that he had had to himself he had spent with Fernpaw, unless she had been busy with Beetlestreak.  His best friend had never failed to keep him busy and put a smile on his face, even if she couldn&#39;t train by his side as he and she had dreamed of as kits.  And, eventually, everything else got in the way of the littler things, such as childhood idols.  And, with that, his and Alerceclaw&#39;s relationship had slowly dwindled out into the shadow of the past, and they hadn&#39;t had much reason to converse again... until now, that is.  

                 Marigolddust couldn&#39;t help but be uncomfortable, unsure exactly how he should act or what he should say to the deputy.  He felt as if he was going through a test that, if he didn&#39;t pass, he couldn&#39;t give it another try, rather than the idyll scene it was in reality.  The sun was high in the sky, beaming down at all of the cats below, and the snow glimmered and sparkled under the happy light, accompanied only by the gentle song of the bare branches brushing against one another above the two toms&#39; heads.  Yet, for Marigolddust, he heard another noise, too, no matter how dramatic it was.  His heart beat in his ears, and he could almost feel his face heating up as a sheepish smile was displayed across his features, watching as Alerceclaw dipped his head to the medicine cat.  <em>Kit me would have freaked at this,</em> he thought, but he ignored the thought soon after and let it drift to the back of his mind on the river of thoughts that was ever present in his mind.</span>

                  Returning the gesture, Marigolddust brought up enough courage to speak.  <em><strong><em>&quot;You too, Alerceclaw.  And I&#39;m... I&#39;m doing well, thank you,&quot;</em></strong></em> he responded, a kind look in his eyes despite how nervous he felt.  The first thing he had to focus on was <em>not</em> letting himself trip over his own words.  If he couldn&#39;t take himself seriously, then how could Alerceclaw?  Taking in a deep breath, Marigolddust took his time in exhaling, although he made the action subtle enough to almost be unnoticeable.  <em><strong><em>&quot;I was... wondering, if maybe you&#39;d be interested in going herb gathering with me?&quot;</em></strong></em> he asked, before continuing, his words slowly leaving his mouth at a faster and faster rate as his anxiety began to take control of his tongue, <em><strong><em>&quot;There&#39;s not many herbs out there anymore, but if we can find anything it would be a success.  You don&#39;t have to, of course.&quot;</em></strong></em>  As he finished, he found his tail hugging close to his flank, and he was acutely aware of how stiff he was standing as he awaited a response.

Kits were always easy for her to talk to, they always had questions to ask, they wanted to learn everything there was to know about the world from the adults around them. She always indulged them in the more innocent of questions, “how long is my apprenticeship would last?”, “can I learn how to fight right away?”. It was silly, but all kits weren’t born with omnipotence. They deserved to know what they were getting into, and she didn’t mind sharing whatever knowledge she gained over the years as a warrior, deputy, and now a leader, with them. <strong>”I’m sure you will, are you looking forward to your training? You’ll get to explore the forest with your mentor and learn many things. Is there anything you want to learn in particular?”</strong> she tilted her head slightly to the side, watching the kit who was looking up to her. She seemed unphased, might have missed the chaos of the battle that had ravaged their camp so recently. <em>Thank StarClan if she did, dealing with such horrific memories so early on can be so damaging. I’m glad to see she’s taking it well.</em>

She never excelled in the art of stealth, that was for certain. Laurelstar was always a large cat, despite starting out as a tiny kit herself, she grew exponentially. Her size, nonetheless, had caused her to stand out like a white-pelted cat standing atop a charcoal-gray stone. The ThunderClan sovereign did not care, she preferred to be seen, she wanted any of her potential foes to know just who they were squaring up against, just who’s wrath they were incurring. Laurelstar was a powerful warrior, and was always the flashy sort. Grand displays of her strength were commonplace, but not to be underestimated… Why would she need to be stealthy if her enemies knew she was going to be present anyways? She didn’t mind the idea of her terrifying presence hanging over their heads like a boogeyman ready to reach out and grab them, they <em>should</em> fear her if they dared make a wrong move against her clan.

Yet it was her own fear that prompted her to be doing these routine checks, and she had appeared to awaken one little kitten tonight by mistake.

Her eyes widened as she spotted a young cream-colored she-kit, round, owl-like eyes inspecting their surroundings. She could feel them resting on her frame, and she blinked, turning towards the kit and letting out a small, disappointed sigh. <strong>”It’s all right, it’s Laurelstar. I’m just doing a nest-check, making sure everyone is safe in camp. I didn’t mean to wake you.”</strong> she didn’t intend to disturb anyone’s rest, much less a young kitten who needed it most. Laurelstar was trying to be careful in her work regarding the monitoring of her clanmates’ wellbeing. The leader had made it a habit since she was appointed as deputy. She took on a more nurturing role, her clanmates were her family to her. For her own peace of mind, she had to check on them all. <strong>”You’re Vanillakit, right? I’m sorry if I woke you up, you should get some rest. It’s not good for someone your age to stay up this late, sleep helps you grow after all.”</strong> it was the mother in her to tell this kit it was bedtime, though all of her adoptive kits were apprentices or older— and she doubted she’d adopt any more for the time being. Since her mate, Hollyfrost’s death, it felt like the wrong time, and she couldn’t fathom raising another kit without her by her side. She loved kits, but right now she needed to heal before she ever took on another as her own. <em>I need to focus on the children I already have, they need me now more than ever.</em>

Still, that didn’t mean she couldn’t show kindness towards the youth of her clan, after all.

Bandit let out a sigh of relief after Laurelstar came to his defense. It gave him a quick confidence boost and he lifted his head up, trying to put on a brave but unthreatening face. He put his attention back on the leader, focusing on her words and where she was pointing. Her easygoing smile encouraged a bright smile of his own as he followed to where she pointed, looking over the Apprentices den with great interest. Oh how he longed to curl up and sleep right now, the ache in his paws begging for rest. But he needed to listen and learn first.

The tom reluctantly forced his gaze away from the warm looking den and back to Laurelstar, nodding along to her words while trying his best not to feel overwhelmed by all the information given to him.  <strong>&quot;I understand Laurelstar. I&#39;ll prove myself, no worries!&quot;</strong> He exclaimed quite confidently, head held high. Bandit held the personality of a young, overconfident kittypet, blissfully unaware of Thunderclans recent hardships. Soon he would learn what it truly meant to live in a clan, the tom not prepared for the hard days ahead of him. He would need to work tirelessly for his share and for the approval of these strangers around him, if he did wish to stay. 

<strong>&quot;Whatever you or anyone else needs, I&#39;ll do my part and I wont disappoint! I promise.&quot;</strong> This was a heavy promise to make but one he intended to keep. <span class="pre pre--inline">(Sorry for taking forever to respond!)</span></span>

Another freezing wind stormed past, battering at Vanillakit once again and making her stagger a little; the small kitten didn&#39;t weigh much at all, despite already being at four moons old. White-flecked fur akin to the billions of Starclan&#39;s glowing eyes above - or so, that&#39;s what her mother had said they were - Vanillakit regained her composure just in time to hear the soft, sleepy-edged mew of Laurelstar. Heterochromatic eyes widening ever so slightly, Vanillakit could now recognize more of the ThunderClan sovereign&#39;s attributes from her dark silhouette now that she got confirmation that it was her - the fluffy, soft neck fur, the long, notched ears. In fact, the cream tabby seemed to be a little confused as to why she hadn&#39;t recognized the russet tortoiseshell in the first place. Fur sleep-rumpled and now windswept, the kitten stifled a shiver and then pranced towards the leader. <strong>&quot;Oh no, I mustn&#39;t, miss Laurelstar.&quot;</strong> The little darling&#39;s mew was as soft and delicate as that of a daffodil petal. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m much more interested in what you&#39;re doing now. Besides, based on what I look like, I think it will be quite a while before I grow any more.&quot;</strong> 

The light-colored molly, pale stripes practically non-existent in the deep-cutting shadows, tilted her head, soft cheek fur swaying with it. <strong>&quot;Whatever <em>are</em> you doing out here though, miss Laurelstar?&quot;</strong> she inquired, eyelids fluttering once or twice as a more mellow breeze carried in the night&#39;s atmosphere. It was nothing to an average cat, but it looked as if one strong wind could carry Vanillakit away. <strong>&quot;It is quite cold,&quot;</strong> she said with a nod of her head as she spoke, flicking snow off her hind paw, <strong>&quot;and my mama says it could get so cold you might freeze to death! I don&#39;t want you to freeze, miss. I&#39;d feel terrible.&quot;</strong> The molly seemed quite good at rambling, but it was all in good intent.</span>

This kittypet certainly didn&#39;t lack for enthusiasm, to the leader it was rather amusing rather than annoying. He seemed sincere, and he did impress her back in the forest when he managed to keep up with her and track her down whenever she did get ahead of him. He had potential, but she couldn&#39;t hold her breath. The tortoiseshell leader would be glad to have another apprentice running around camp, a potential new warrior, but Bandit was here temporarily, according to him.

<em>Well, if he does decide he wishes to join, he knows who to come to.</em>

He wasn&#39;t the first to join their esteemed clan from outside their borders, and most certainly would not be the last. Proving himself to the clan through the work he does now from here on out was going to be essential if the clan were to accept him. Arduous training, putting in every effort to bring back prey and to defend the clan even if he hadn&#39;t sworn loyalty to them yet. While he was here, he followed <em>their</em> rules, as he was guest for now, nothing more. 

<strong>&quot;I&#39;ll look forward to seeing that. Just keep your nose clean while you&#39;re in my camp, kit. If anyone bothers you, let me know and I can straighten it out. That doesn&#39;t mean you can pick on my clanmates either, remember you&#39;re our guest. I can just kick you out.&quot;</strong>

She had to put up the big scary leader front, but she was sure no incidents would arise from <em>him</em> provoking her clanmates. Kittypets typically knew they were squishy, and weren&#39;t the sort to pick a fight they knew they couldn&#39;t win. They had <em>some</em> sort of self-preservation instinct.

Kits were also stubborn about bedtime, they <em>insisted</em> they could stay up but she had a feeling she might have to return Vanillakit to her mother the moment she finally did fall asleep talking to her. It was a matter of time, and the leader figured she could afford to wait it out, might as well entertain the kit for the time she remained awake for in order to try and allow her to sleep. <strong>&quot;Well, as I said before, I&#39;m just making sure everyone is safe in their nests. I know every single cat in the clan, and I look out for them and ensure they are in their nest at night, unless I know if any of the warriors are doing sentry duty.&quot;</strong> the tortoisehsell femora gestured to the camp entrance with her bushy tail. Topside, outside of the tunnel that led up to the forest, there typically were at least two cats who kept guard of the camp at night. They would signal those who were sleeping if there was danger, or if there was an attack. They were always different cats as well, just to keep it fair within the clan so nobody had an inordinate sleep schedule because of one task.

This kit&#39;s concern for her well-being was touching, but in truth, Laurelstar wasn&#39;t cold in the slightest. Not yet, anyways, tonight was clear for leaf-bare, the stars and the moon were visible, indicating there were no clouds in the sky to conceal them. If it were snowing, she might have thought twice before venturing down into camp in the cold, but this habit she had of checking on her clanmates at night was only a short trip, a head-count if anything. Nothing more. Vanillakit just so happened to spot her as she was making sure every single kit was sleeping in the nursery as they should. <strong>&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, my fur is so thick that I barely feel the cold. I was only down here making sure everyone was okay, I was going to return to my nest in a little while so I could get some rest myself. It&#39;s nice and warm in my den up on the Highledge.&quot;</strong> that was certainly true, but it felt a little spacious just having the den to herself. It felt lonely, but it <em>was</em> hers, she had to make the best of it.

Vanillakit peered at Laurelstar for a moment, taking in her divine appearance. Her grand mane and tall frame <em>looked</em> warm, but she couldn&#39;t help but hesitate. Her mama had told her leaders make all kinds of sacrifices for their peers, so she wouldn&#39;t put it past Laurelstar to lie so her Clanmates didn&#39;t worry. But, it seemed as if the tortoiseshell sovereign was truthfully speaking. <strong>&quot;Well, alright.&quot;</strong> Vanillakit said, trying to stifle a yawn but failing as her jaws stretched open and closed. Her eyelids hung over her mismatched oculars sleepily, but she refused to admit she was tired. She was going to make sure she didn&#39;t pass up this conversation so easily. <strong>&quot;Well,&quot;</strong> she said softly, words slurring from weariness, <strong>&quot;I wan&#39;...I wanna make sure y..you go back to your den and get some sleep. Can I...wa..walk you...&quot;</strong> She gestured the last part of her sentence, getting quite drowsy. She wanted to keep talking so she stayed awake but the words slipped off her tongue and she was too tired to catch them. Instead, she just looked up at Laurelstar.

This kit seemed insistent she return to her den upon the Highledge, and it was hard for her to not stifle an amused chuckle at her word of authority. Who was <em>she</em>, the leader of ThunderClan, to disobey an order from a kit! <strong>”Alright, alright, I counted everyone in camp, so you can walk me back.”</strong> she accepted the offer with a warm, gentle smile, dipping her skull towards Vanillakit. The russet-toned tortoiseshell rose up to her huge white paws, watching the creamy-colored she-kit carefully. The Highledge was dangerous to traverse, especially at night, so she might not have the kit climb up the large boulders that acted as a staircase to the den atop the ledge. Laurelstar wasn’t going to let an accident occur, especially with a kit. She’d feel awful if Vanillakit got hurt under her watch.

<strong>”Just to the foot of the Highledge, all right? You’re still a little too small to climb all the way. It can be slippery too.”</strong> she began to slowly pad towards the steps that led up to her den. Her eyes were still trained on the kit tailing behind her, making sure she didn’t accidentally fall asleep while she walked with her. Though she wouldn’t be surprised if she had to bring her back to the nursery before she went to bed. Vanillakit was clearly about to topple over and slip into a deep slumber. <em>Gotta make sure she doesn’t fall on her face, waking up with a bloody nose is never fun.</em>

The little tabby molly smiled as Laurelstar accepted her offer, her drowsy visage mustering a gentle smile. Screwing her eyes shut for a moment, she tried waking herself up a bit before blinking them back open. Well, that notion had certainly been to no avail, so Vanillakit just shook her head a bit and started to pad after Laurelstar. Their silhouettes in the darkened camp contrasted greatly, with Laurelstar&#39;s tall and divine structure and Vanillakit&#39;s tiny, dainty frame. She was getting bigger, but was still quite a bit smaller than her siblings. Which was evident, because she was practically wading in the snow, the thick white coat presented atop the soil reaching up to her elbows; for the much taller leader it was only about ankle-deep. If Vanillakit were to fall asleep right now, no one would ever notice her little body snoozing away.

Shivering a little, Vanillakit looked up to Laurelstar as she spoke again, giving the mottled sovereign a slow nod as they neared the Highledge. Skirting the edge of the rock, Vanillakit watched Laurelstar ascend up the stair-like rocks, then gave her a smile and a nod as the leader threw a glance back her way. <strong>&quot;Good night, Laurelstar,&quot;</strong> she purred sleepily, raising a frost-tipped paw to give her a good-natured wave before retreating back the other way to the nursery.

The tortoiseshell leader had carefully trudged through the snow to make sure she wasn’t outpacing the young she-kit who had been hopping through the thick blanket like a fox pouncing on it’s prey. While Laurelstar could easily step through it all, being tall enough to push on through without an issue, Vanillakit did not have that luxury just yet. Too small, but she still pushed forward, insisting on escorting her back to her den. The sovereign couldn’t help but to feel proud of the kits of her clan, how strong they were. Despite the obstacles in her path, the creamy-colored she-kit was determined on seeing her quest through. She was tenacious and not afraid to confront the problems that stood ahead of her.

As they finally reached the base of the steps that led up to her den, she could see that Vanillakit was drowsy, as to be expected. A kit up past her bedtime was always going to fall back into her slumber easily— but Vanillakit looked as if she were pushing herself to stay awake long enough to return to the nursery. <strong>”Good night, Vanillakit. Get lots of rest.”</strong> she returned the kitten’s goodbye, a warm smile stretching across her face as she watched her begin to turn around and head back to her den. Watching the kit from afar, Laurelstar slowly began to ascend the steps leading up to her den, making sure she wasn’t going to collapse from exhaustion on her way back. The russet-toned tortoiseshell was climbing to the Highledge at a snail’s pace, at least until she saw the young kit slip through the entrance that led to the nursery. She was safe in her nest by now, and all was well. <em>That’s good.</em> she couldn’t help but to grin, only to find that moments later she found herself letting out a yawn. 

Even leaders needed their beauty rest.

The skies were hazy with pallid gray clouds hanging in the skies like an unfinished canvas of muted silver tones. The tortoiseshell leader had emerged from her den, parting the lichen curtain that hung from the entrance as she stepped outside. Slowly making her way to the edge of the Highledge that overlooked the hollowed out quarry down below, Laurelstar cleared her throat as she prepared to gather her clan together for a meeting. <strong>”Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey gather beneath the Highledge!”</strong> came the rallying cry, the signal to all of her clanmates to congregate below her perch and to listen in on what she had to say. Though she had to admit this would be rather quick, as she only had one order of business to tackle today. Luckily, it was nothing bad, in fact she had to admit it was much more positive than anticipated.

Settling herself down, the leader sat up straight as she awaited her clanmates to gather down below so she could proceed on with the meeting as planned.

As the dawn of the new morning mist arose — so did Laurelstars roar to call upon Thunderclan for a Clan gathering. And as the blasting voice echoed through camp, pounding rays through Thunderclanners ears — The Matriarchs adoptive sire had been the first one to have emerged through the apprentices den. The firm-blistering wind washing over the mollies coat — setting on a soft jacket of winters freezing breeze upon her tall physique.

Yet Tigerpaws determination distracted her from the misty cold. She had been waiting for this day to rise — being assigned to a new and much more skillful teacher; Promised outside of the possibilities to be put under the influence of a crazed and callous mentor. Finchbriar was nothing but a traitor — combined with her lack of contribution to Tigerpaws training, and causing the she-cat to be stored away in the medicine den due to physical and mental scarring from the dark forest battle. For moons and moons — Tigerpaw was nothing but just a servant to Finchbriar.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The older apprentice bounded across the thin snow as she advanced across the clearing in a flashing pace — the embrace of a fresh dawns light washing over her frame the moment she jumped out of her shadows from the camps lonesome corners of the apprentices den. The place she promised to never lounge around anymore, she had to make herself a worthy cat to the Clan — Something Finchbriar told her she&#39;d never accomplish to gain ever. This was her day. Another chance to fullfil expectations ingraved in her head. A chance to prove her worth, and Finchbriar wasn&#39;t looking — She didn&#39;t need to look anyway.

Olive hues met with Golden-aqua oculars as Tigerpaw peered up to her tall-standing mother — skidding to a halt as she reached the center of the clearing. Brows furrowing down on narrow eyes with ambition and spurring pride — gratitude for her mothers work to find her a stable mentor to finish her training. Her tail lashed slowly behind — the tip glliding against the ground as anticipation stung her quarters.

Motivated and ready ... Yet, somewhat neurotic at the same time.</span>

Even though Marigolddust had been distracted by organizing his herbs on the shelves and cleaning out the most useless plants, this didn’t stop him from coming to attention as soon as he heard the call from Laurelstar.  Marigolddust wasn’t too used to hearing her voice calling out the meetings, rather than Iceheart’s, but this didn’t stop his attention from always being caught by the cry.  Standing up, Marigolddust was about to leave his den before he realized that it might not be the best idea to leave what patients he had alone in his den.  Sure, there weren’t many cats who needed his attention, but if anything happened, he would have rather been there to attend to them and whatever problem they might have.  He didn’t want to be absent for any emergencies, anyhow.  So, instead of going out and joining the crowd that had gathered under the highledge light he did as a warrior, Marigolddust resided on the perch of his den entrance, straining his ears to hear whatever might be so softly spoken that he might miss.  He couldn’t help but wonder what the meeting was about, but his curiosity was held back enough for him to stay where he was, rather than where everything was happening.</span>

To say this wasn&#39;t personal would be an outright lie. Not one, but two of her kits were apprenticed to traitors to the clan, and now went without them for some time. While they were receiving training from multiple different warriors around camp whenever they could, accompanying other apprentices so they did not fall behind, it was not the same. They deserved a formal education where they could get it, and today she was assigning Tigerpaw a proper mentor. Someone who was trustworthy. A cat she had her eyes on quite often so as to make sure things were running smoothly with the clan, someone who <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> betray the clan at any given moment. Her daughter would be in good paws, and she was positive she was making the correct decision in this reassignment.

Taking a deep breath, she watched the crowd gather below, and she could see that most of her clanmates had arrived, and were whispering amongst themselves as to the nature of the meeting, while others were looking up at her, waiting patiently for her to begin. No sense in waiting around, she supposed, time to get this over with. <strong>&quot;As you all know, we lost many of our warriors when I had to exile the cats who turned traitor to our clan. It has affected many lives in camp, including those of our apprentices. Tigerpaw will be receiving a new, official mentor today to replace her former one.&quot;</strong> there wasn&#39;t exactly a protocol when it came to matters such as these, but she figured <em>reminding</em> the clan of the severity of exile and treason and its consequences could strengthen her point. It was never a good idea to turn on ThunderClan, especially if they intended to betray <em>her</em>. This was for her own kit, and she would not allow her to suffer under another cruel mentor, she refused.

<strong>&quot;Tigerpaw shall be reassigned Alerceclaw as her mentor for the remainder of her apprenticeship. I trust that his guidance as not only a seasoned warrior of ThunderClan, but as my deputy shall serve her well in her training.&quot;</strong> her heterochromatic gaze flickered over towards the dark-colored tom sitting in the clearing, she was entrusting her kit with him. Her safety and the results of her training was now his responsibility. In a way, this was a test of trust, in whether he could not only serve his clanmates and balance his duties, but also with her own kin. She believed he would handle it just fine, but after what had happened to her kit in the time she was training under Finchbriar, she was only being cautious.

<strong>&quot;Meeting dismissed.&quot;</strong>

With a wave of her tail, the clan meeting had ended. Indeed it was rather short, but it needed to be done. She could rest easy knowing Tigerpaw had a more capable mentor teaching her the ways of a ThunderClan warrior.

       It was about time AlerceClaw would receive another apprentice. Having apprenticed a few others before and even motivating kits for their future - take MarigoldDust for example, this deputy had gotten into the habit of usually having someone under their training.  
    Tigerpaw in this instance was a curious pick. Not having grown familiar to them nor their previous mentor before, Alerce was really sent out to shrouded territory. But that did not intimidate him. Really, he had no particular reaction to it. It was just another apprentice assigned to him. Despite being LaurelStars daughter, the challenge remained the same. Alerce trained well. He was confident Tigerpaw would be rightfully redirected from where FinchBrair had hurled her off course.
    With Laurels polychromatic gander on him, the bachelor took a grateful nod of his crown to the hierarch before moving up to the partial neophyte of the clan.
<strong>&quot;Tigerpaw,&quot;</strong> The mesomorphic gladiator greeted the striated fae. With a ceremonious delicate press of his nose to hers.

The growing chatter died down as Laurelstar announced her pick — Tigerpaw finding herself frozen in her stance. She hadn&#39;t been too familiar with the deputy, only seeing the bland yet hardworking part of him each and everyday as he passed by her trail. You could say that the apprentice fell into a cloud of awe — jaw slightly agaping up to the retreating form of Laurelstar as she waved her bushy tail for the ceremonies dismissal. Being given to the respected cat and deputy must meant that she was either lucky — or had alot for her to unpack and work on. Alerceclaw didn&#39;t seem like the enthusiastic or friendly type — Just like Finchbriar, less cruel but more nonchalant. Or rather... Hard to phase.

<strong>&quot;— Alerceclaw.&quot;</strong>  Greeting firm and swift as she turned around — locking gazes with the dark-oak like bachelor. Her belly twisting, holding herself back from gulping down her timorous feeling so visibly. A small lash of her tail-tip emerged as their noses made contact. Instantly, the molly took a step back — dipping her head in the deputies presence.  

<strong>&quot;I won&#39;t be disappointing you. I promise.&quot;</strong></span>

       With Laurels departure and the slowly simmered bustling of the clan, Alerce had only enough to akncowledge it with a flicker of his carvernous hearing counterpart. Tympanic membrane no longer paying it attention and rather shifting it to his new learner. Her face was familiar. The princess of the clan was only caught in this brutes sights once of twice if his memory serves him well. She was the cautious type, obedient and a quick-learner. From what he knows by distant observation. 
    Even as he approached her, the faes physique stiffened nervously. Uncertainly - reather. He couldnt blame her. 
    But to counter her words? Truth wouldnt be ideally spoken with prying eyes and ears. 
<strong>&quot;Noted.&quot;</strong> Simplistic - it was good enough. A little dip of his cranial function and the deputy himself insisted departure worh a side step of his oversized black toed manus. <strong>&quot;We start training today at sundown. Meet at camp.&quot;</strong> Phlegmatic physiognomy refused to reciprocate Tigerpaws emotions.and before the tyro could counter or argue his words, the virile had turned and descended from the rock.

       The xanthippe let the little shimmer of affection curse her harlequin gander as she watched the small thing struggle. This Thunderclanner was no sadistic individual to find pleasantries in anothers&#39; struggle, but more the development of kit. The adventurous ambition they put themselves through, like every other kit did. Like SwiftStorm herself did. 
    <strong>&quot;Ooh,&quot;</strong> A waver of her dimensional tail and the madame strode to the fresh kill pile. <strong>&quot;Perfect; a vole.&quot;</strong> It was a good starter. Small meal and tender flesh, the striated duchess took this back to Sunkit to shorten their labored journey and set it down gently at their paws. <strong>&quot;Here, take a bite. Try it, it&#39;s good!&quot;</strong> She urged with a tear at the exterior to free Sunkit from the struggle of biting through the fur and skin.                    </span>

Sunkit had made it out of the nursery as she was following Swiftstorm and kept pawing at the snow as it made a crunch like sound. She enjoyed the sound but stopped and looked up towards her adopted mother who dropped at vole at her paws. She sniffs it as this was her first time having an actual piece of prey and bit into the crimson colored meat. She purrs as she was enjoying the piece she had in her mouth and some of the crimson liquid had gotten on the kits fur which she didn&#39;t pay no mind to.

       Not innately someone with a stern demeanor, Alerce needed only a second of relief as he made his way down to camp for the second time this day. The camp held so many memories - as it would for anyone his age with the life he governed. The life he invited so many others into. But alas - and not that he was old, in fact he was a middle age warrior. Alas. He was the last one standing. Everyone he had ever known to be a friend or anything of the sort had died or resorted to something like IceHeart was now. This brobdingnagian was still unsure with how IceHeart had gotten to the state, but he knew the fae he knew before no longer resided in that husk anymore. He was unfamiliar to her just as much as she was to him. Though he substantial advice was still remembered. The one IceStar had given him. Not IceHeart. See, there was a thing about memories. They were always only your mind replaying an important event. Only ever that. Emphasizing the past and how quickly time can fly. And if you let time fly by, you will come to realize how many regrets you would gain. 
    But enough of that, Tigerpaw had to be analyzed on this training session. He already got quite enough from just greeting her earlier. She was the clans princess. And as tragic as it was; being raised by one parent only since recently the other had passed, Tiger has yet to portray any symptoms to that. Even something as simple as no reaction at all can say something about her. But for now; she remained a timid, ambitious, and nervous little thing in this bachelors mind. As some apprentices normally start out. 
    Unfortunately, that will have to change if they were to successfully get through training with him.</span>

While everlastingly washed out tones of grey would persist in the skies above the forest territories for the next few moons or so, the ThunderClan leader would not allow the drab, morose appearance of their environment dampen her spirit. In truth, she felt quite pleased at the fact the cold weather was here for a while, she much preferred it over the oppressive heat of green-leaf. Instead of feeling like she was roasting alive under the harsh rays of the sun, she was protected from the frigid zephyrs of leaf-bare by her thick pelage of mottle russet and ginger patches. The tortoiseshell was as happy as a clam. 

However, she could tell not everyone shared her enthusiasm for the season. She couldn’t fault them for that either. Cold weather meant less prey, and less prey meant hungry bellies, and hungry bellies meant vulnerability to the elements, sickness, and injury. Vulnerability led to irritated cats or the persistent feeling of hopelessness, or even worse, it could spell out death if left neglected. She’d avoid it at all costs, her clan was to survive this season, her first leaf-bare as leader of ThunderClan— being thrusted into her throne just at the turn of the season. She would ensure her clan would prosper, and that they would be well-fed and warm in their dens. Most of all, safe from all those who sought to threaten them. While things seemed quiet for now, she would never let her guard down, not ever again. 

The sovereign slipped out of the cavern etched into the quarry wall adjacent to the Highledge, slowly descending the uneven staircase of boulders that led up to her den. She was used to the climb from her time as deputy, giving reports to Icestar while she led the clan, yet now she was the one overseeing the clan, receiving reports from her deputy. It had been about a moon and a half since she took charge, and she still felt strange about it. Yet her clan welcomed her with open arms, she must be doing something right.

At least, she hoped they would be honest about it to her. They could tell her if they weren’t happy, she wouldn’t take offense. A good leader didn’t scare their subordinates into submission and ruled with an iron grip. Not unless they were forced to use such drastic measures. <em>A last resort.</em>

Just on the opposite side of the camp sat a very fluffy tom who was currently sitting with his chin up towards the sky, eyes closed and a look of content on his face. He would sit there in the little bits of sun that the ongoing leafbare gave to them. He sat there for mere minutes at a time, longing for greenleaf to come. It only seemed like the cold had just begun and there was more in store. He didn&#39;t think about it, for now, he just loafed in the sun.

He would open his eyes every so often to look around the camp, the day cats passing by and saying their hellos with polite nods as they continued on their way. He shook his fur out a bit and then opened his eyes expecting to see a semiempty camp but the sight of Laurelstar wasn&#39;t one the tom had expected, feeling confused for a second but when he saw her he smiled. <strong>&quot;Hello Laurelstar!&quot;</strong> He said with a grin, untucking his paws and standing up. His jaws parted in a slow yawn before quickly closing.</span>

She wasn’t a recluse to her clan in the slightest, in fact it was rare to find her in her den in the mornings and past sun-high. Laurelstar, even in her overseeing position as leader of ThunderClan, tended to handle menial tasks alongside the warriors of her clan. Was it to kill boredom, she wondered? Or just to prevent an idle mind. She loathed waiting around for reports and doing nothing, that wasn’t who she was. She loved leading, she was proud to be the one tasked with protecting <em>her</em> clan and making good use of the nine lives their warrior ancestors granted her. However, she also did not want to sit around and do nothing while everyone else handled the work, not while her bones were still brimming with vitality and vigor, and while her workaholic tendencies were just itching to be let loose. The tortoiseshell was shot out of a cannon sometimes, bursting at the seams with energy. She didn’t stop until she was absolutely depleted and actually needed to sleep, she was that dedicated.

Though some might call her a bit of a “try-hard”, which wasn’t untrue.

Her odd-colored gaze widened as she picked up on a voice calling her over, swishing her bushy tail behind her as she slowly approached the cat who’d summoned her by name. Tumblestep, he seemed in a chipper mood today from a superficial observation and by his eager greeting. She returned the pleasantries with a small nod and a lopsided smile. <strong>”Hey Tumblestep.”</strong>  she knew all of her clanmates by name, as she should as their leader, even if she rarely spoke to some. She had to know these things. <strong>”You’re not too chilly out here? I’d expect you to be in the dens with the others if you weren’t handling duties. This weather could freeze the whiskers off of some!”</strong>

The sun could be seen barely peeking through the thin sheen of the hazy clouds hanging in the once blue expanse above their heads. A calmer day for once, no snow, and the howling winds had ceased to be for the moment. All seemed well, this was a good day for leaf-bare’s harsh conditions. A reprieve from the unrelenting ice and snow, it was all they could ask for. <em>At least it isn’t dry, a fire won’t break out since we’re getting so much snow.</em> the ground would be moist when the snow melted and was absorbed into the soil, a layer of protection from flames that raged through their territory two leaf-bares ago. One thing they did not have to worry about.

Today, she would be gathering her clan together to bear witness to a great event in any apprentice’s life. In her opinion, this was long overdue for the individual in question, and she deserved to be rewarded for her bravery in the battle and how she remained loyal to her clan when there were threats within their walls. She was not the only one, but she was the oldest, and it was high time she was promoted to a warrior. The tortoiseshell sovereign shook out her pelt as she stepped out upon the Highledge, staring down at the clearing down below. Clearing her throat, she rallied her clanmates with a loud cry. <strong>”Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey gather beneath the Highledge!”</strong>

It was time to begin, and with that, she waited.

In the following moons of the apprentice’s recovery, there was part of her that was concerned she’d never be a warrior. She had been sort of struggling with lots of things since that <em>time.</em> She’d been patiently waiting for her day to come, working her hardest to train. Even now she’d be considered a rather seasoned apprentice. Leadership had changed, a new deputy had been chosen, and Thunderclan was in a new era. So in turn, Cloverpaw was too.

The voice of Laurelstar echoed out across camp, and she was one of the first to rise, stretching out her limbs and looking at the healing scar that extended up her leg- Marigolddust had certainly done well in helping her with that one. She <em>could</em> actually walk now. The black and white Molly was sly in joining the cats below the highledge, eyes blown wide with curiosity.

The small tan tom poked his head out of the Apprentices Den, eyes beaming with wonder as he heard the leader&#39;s call. Was this a clan meeting? His very first meeting ever? Fur prickling with excitement, Bandit scampered out into the camp, meeting the other cats beneath the Highledge, putting his full attention up to Laurelstar.

His excitement for this occasion has him excitedly shifting from one foot to the other as he smiled, waiting for whatever news the leader had for them.</span>

As she watched as her clanmates slowly congregated below the stone ledge that jutted out of the quarry’s walls, she took another deep breath and spoke once again. <strong>”Today I have gathered you all here to bear witness to one of our own apprentices, for her actions have decreed that she is ready to be promoted to a warrior.”</strong> her gaze rested upon the molly in question, a warm smile forming on her features. It was time she granted Cloverpaw her warrior name, she deserved it for all her good deeds. <strong>”Cloverpaw, please step forward.”</strong>

She waited for the young she-cat to step forward into the empty space left in the center of the crowd, still smiling as she prepared to say the next set of scripted words that were customary for these affairs, ones she’d heard over and over again. <strong>”I, Laurelstar, leader of ThunderClan, call upon my warrior ancestors to look down on this apprentice. They have trained hard to understand the ways of your noble code, and I commend them to you as a warrior in their turn.”</strong> the first line of the whole longwinded speech, she just wanted to grant her warrior name already, where was the fun in these sacred speeches anyways? Still, she needed to do it anyways, all a part of the ceremony. <strong>”Cloverpaw, do you promise to uphold the Warrior Code and to protect and defend your clan, even at the cost of your life?”</strong>

The leader awaited with baited breath, her bushy tail staying still behind her as she watched the black and white-furred she-cat down below. <em>Just say “I do.” it’ll be awkward if you don’t, please.</em>

She had always been rather bored with clan life when she was younger, and she began to realize this is the first ceremony she might&#39;ve actually been paying attention to. Did the leaders have to memorize those words? Seemed kind of hard. <em>Wait.</em> Was that her name Laurelstar just said? Oh.. she was looking at her. Quietly, Clover took one step forward and peered up at the sovereign to make sure she was <em>really</em> listening this time. She had grown quite a bit from that tiny squirrel-snatching kitten Rooksnap had brought into camp. Now she was being promoted with hardly any family here to watch her. 

&quot;<strong>Oh! Um..</strong>&quot; she had really been listening that time, and she was rather persistent to not let any of that sadness crap bother her. It hadn&#39;t been long since Marbled had been made a warrior.. and all had been well then. &quot;<strong>Yes, Laurelstar. I- I do.</strong>&quot; she almost forgot what she was supposed to say in that moment, because her mind was flooded with rather <em>unwanted</em> thoughts. <em>Just think about how you&#39;ll never have to clean another nest. Or be with those wimpy apprentices anymore.</em> Her gaze traveled about the crowd and she waited with baited breath.

Cloverpaw’s response had sealed the deal, no matter how hesitant it may have sounded. She had made the agreement that would allow her to join the ranks of ThunderClan’s warriors— the rite of passage had been completed. The russet-toned tortoiseshell nodded once again, flashing a wide grin at the acceptance of her new rank. <strong>”Then by the powers of StarClan, I give you your warrior name. Cloverpaw, from this moment on you will be known as Cloverwilt. StarClan honors your courage and resilience, and we welcome you as a full warrior of ThunderClan.”</strong> 

She stayed silent for a moment, to allow for a chorus of her clanmates to call out their newest warrior’s name out loud. Before she had to address another pressing matter with them all, she did not want to take away from Cloverwilt’s celebration.

The young, dark-furred tortoiseshell had been sitting in the crowd, looking up at her mother and to the other faces she could see. She knew Cloverpaw, Clover<em>wilt</em> now. She flicked her bobbed tail for a moment, joining in on the crowd chanting <strong>”Cloverwilt! Cloverwilt! Cloverwilt!”</strong> though more subdued and not so loud, she wasn’t one to strain her voice for no good reason. Besides, she only knew her as an acquaintance.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">{Coyotepaw}</div>
The young, light brown tabby tom had been sitting on the fringes of the crowd, just listening in as he usually had in these ceremonies. He participated in chanting the newest warrior’s name, just out of courtesy. He knew she had helped their clan out immensely in the battle, and helped protect them. It was the least he could do.</span>

Well, she might&#39;ve not been the most cheered for new warrior, but one thing was for sure, she seemed awfully proud of herself. To her, that&#39;s all that seemed to matter in the end. She hadn&#39;t been the best apprentice in the world, and she&#39;d made more enemies than friends, but with Clover<em>wilt</em> came a new era. With a perfect name.

She glanced at Laurelstar, and the ghost of a smile crossed her lips. She was finally a full warrior of Thunderclan, and perhaps with a newfound respect of the code. She was rather glad to listen to the chants of her new name, soaking in all its glory. <em>Cloverwilt.</em> How perfect.</span>

Cloverwilt seemed absolutely pleased with her new name, and she couldn’t be happier for her in this moment. This was a moment every kit and apprentice had dreamed of, the day they would receive their coveted warrior name. The name they would have for the rest of their life, unless it was like her case and they became leader of their clan. One day, these cats would be the ones leading, the ones she’d be passing her torch to, or perhaps Alerceclaw would be— considering the fact that she and the tom weren’t that far apart in age. Needless to say, these cats would be their successors, they had to prepare them for the world they’d be inheriting.

She let out a small sigh, noticing the crowd’s cries were now dying down. Laurelstar hadn’t dismissed them yet, and this next order of business was rather important. <strong>”I have to ask you all to stay for a moment, for we will be conducting a vote.”</strong> she dipped her head to the crowd, before her gaze drifted over towards the former kittypet hanging out in the crowd. <strong>”Bandit, step forward.”</strong> she gestured for the young tom to take his place in the center of the clearing. Now would be the time to determine whether he would stay with their clan or not, and this was all up to her clanmates to decide.

<strong>”Bandit, a former kittypet, has requested that he join our ranks as an apprentice. I want everyone to cast a vote as to whether they want him to do so, or not. If you are in favor of Bandit joining ThunderClan, please step to the right of the Highledge. All those who are opposed to him staying, please step to the left.”</strong>

This was how they always conducted new additions to their clan, a voting system. Bandit seemed harmless, and he was eager to learn, but she would not reveal her vote until the very end, just to avoid swaying her clanmates’ opinions.

The tom watched the ceremony with great interest. Without a moment of hesitation, Bandit copied the clan cats and called out for the new warrior. This whole thing was strange, very strange. He really liked it. <strong>&quot;Cloverwilt! Cloverwilt!&quot;</strong> He called with the brightest smile, not truly knowing the seriousness and true pride of such a ceremony.

Then like whiplash, his joy was replaced with anxiety when suddenly his name was called. His eyes shot up to look at Laurelstar, wider than two moons as he stared. He was being called? He looked around at the clan cats, then did as told. He turned his eyes onto the leader once more as he walked forward. Right, Bandit recalled Laurelstar talking about a vote to determine if he stayed or not. The tom felt anxious. He did not bond with many cats since he came here, simply watching from the sidelines and slowly learning from afar. Did cats even know he was here until now? Bandit managed a smile as he stood tall, hoping and waiting for the clan cats to make their votes. No matter what happened next, he would be thankful for this experience in Thunderclan.</span>

After the chanting had quieted down, the young molly had stuck around to listen to her mother’s next set of words. She knew of the kittypet who had come to join the clan, and he seemed… Okay enough. She would be a bit of a hypocrite if she didn’t say yes to allowing someone like him into the clan. She wasn’t born here, she was adopted by Laurelstar and Hollyfrost a long time ago, and while a vote wasn’t necessary for her to join, she still was an outsider once. With that logic in mind, the black tortoiseshell took a step to the right of the Highledge.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">{Coyotepaw}</div>
The tabby hadn’t really paid much mind to the ceremonies going on, his mind had been wandering elsewhere. While he had chanted Cloverwilt’s new name, he had almost missed the fact that a vote was being called. Right to allow for a kittypet to become a new clanmate, and left for no. He looked around carefully, what harm could a kittypet even do anyways? The tom then stepped to the right.

<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">{Shrikecatcher}</div>
The large, long-furred blue-gray tabby tom had been sitting amongst the crowd, listening in on the ceremony as he always had before. They we’re possibly bringing in a new member to their clan? The large tabby blinked for a moment as he looked to Bandit over in the distance, before shrugging his broad shoulders, taking a step to the right.</span>

The tortoiseshell sovereign watched as her clanmates gathered on either side of the Highledge, though she noticed a great majority of them standing to the right side of her perch. She nodded as she took in their votes, before she cast in her own— indicating her approval of allowing Bandit to stay with ThunderClan permanently. No longer a kittypet or a loner, he would be recognized as a member of ThunderClan from here on out. <strong>”It has been decided then, Bandit will be allowed to join ThunderClan permanently.”</strong> her heterochromatic gaze darted to the former kittypet— now turned a clanmate. He was one of them now, a member of their clan, but his name now had to reflect that. His old name was but a reminder of his former life as a kittypet, his new one had to reflect this new chapter in his life.

<strong>”Bandit, now that you have been accepted into the ranks of ThunderClan, you will receive a new apprentice name to reflect your rank as an apprentice.”</strong> she nodded to him, indicating he should pay close attention. This would be his final test to see if he would truly cast aside his old life. <strong>”From this day on, until you receive your warrior name, you will be known as Raccoonpaw. Your mentor will be myself, and I hope to pass on all the knowledge I have as a warrior onto you.”</strong> this would be a good arrangement for him, she built up rapport with him in their first meeting. She figured they would be compatible as a mentor and apprentice. Plus, he would be in good paws with her as his mentor. He should count himself lucky.

The young tom felt his body tremble with great anticipation as he watched the clan take their places. He mostly paid attention to the right side of the Highledge, feeling his muzzle stretch wider with the brightest smile he could muster as more cats cast their votes. Seeing the majority in his favor, he turned his eyes back up to Laurelstar, his heart hammering from the sheer excitement of this occasion. 

Catching her nod, he stilled his movements and gave her his full attention, as if nobody was in the camp but him and the leader. <strong>His</strong> leader, now. Bandit&#39;s ears flicked with interest. It felt as if relief had washed over him. Bandit, the name that connected him to his cruel twolegs would no longer hold him to his past. First it was his collar, and now his name. Raccoonpaw. . . It felt right to him as he repeated it in his head over and over again. And to top it all off, the first Clan cat to show him any mercy, was going to be his mentor. He didn&#39;t know what to say or if he was even supposed to say anything. All he knew was that he truly did count himself as lucky. The luckiest feline to ever walk into this forest. <strong>&quot;T-Thank you, Laurelstar.&quot;</strong></span>

She had a great feeling about Raccoonpaw, even if he would be far behind on his training considering his age at being appointed as an apprentice, but she’d work extra hard to ensure he flourished. He’d be ready when he too was promoted, she’d make sure of it. The sovereign descended from her ledge to meet him down in the clearing, stepping towards him. <strong>”Mentors and apprentices touch their noses to one another in these ceremonies, just to let you know.”</strong> she whispered quietly, just to warn him before she touched her coral-pink nose to his. A custom of this ceremony, a pact between mentor and apprentice that they would agree to do their part in the training process.

She took a step back, before looking to the crowd she was now standing amongst. <strong>”This meeting is dismissed.”</strong> she nodded to her clanmates, before turning to the newest addition to her apprentices. <strong>”You’re in good paws, Raccoonpaw. But we have a lot to go over, a lot of catch up. You’re going to be working hard, and I put my apprentices through the wringer.”</strong> she flicked her tail, and she sounded sincere. She didn’t coddle her pupils, they were to be hardened warriors. She looked out for them, but she had to give them reality checks so they didn’t get caught off guard while they were out there. Raccoonpaw was in for an arduous apprenticeship.

The newly named apprentice nodded and followed her lead, tilting his head up and meeting her half way to connect their noses. His fur bristled at the contact, the ritual feeling strangely special. A new pact, a connection between mentor and apprentice. He smiled up at the large leader with joy in his young innocent eyes, hanging on her every word with great intent. He didn&#39;t mind the thought of hard work ahead. Probably thanks to the ignorance of a kittypet that still ran freely in his brain, surely to be snuffed out in time.

<strong>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t want it any other way!&quot;</strong> He responded with confidence. <strong>&quot;So when do we start training? Will I grow to be as big and powerful as you? When do I become a Warrior?&quot;</strong> The young apprentice buzzed with excitement, rambling on with no signs of stopping. Perhaps he was a little<strong> too </strong>excited for this occasion, eager to put his past as a kittypet behind him and become a brave and powerful Thunderclan cat. If only it would be that quick and simple.</span>

Since he had been accepted into their ranks, he would have to learn that his coddled life as a kittypet had ceased to be. Raccoonpaw was one of them, he was to be trained as a ThunderClan warrior and to know their customs and rites of passage as every other cat had been taught. No more being spoon-fed, he was to be able to sustain himself and his clan now. He had a Code to follow. <strong>”We’ll begin training at dawn tomorrow. You will want to go to sleep early tonight. As for how powerful you want to become, it is up to you. How hard you train and how much effort you put into each session can determine your results.”</strong> she wasn’t smiling, more so a neutral expression had replaced the warm one she adorned for the ceremonies. She had to be stern and unwavering, this was <em>her</em> apprentice, he needed to take this seriously if he was to succeed. <strong>”That will also determine when I decide you are ready for your warrior assessment. You’re far behind for your age, but that isn’t your fault considering when you joined the clan. I have to make sure you’re going to be ready, and we’ll work hard to make sure you get there as soon as possible. I need you to promise me you will do your best during training, I don’t ask for perfection, but I want you to give it your all.”</strong> her bushy tail swayed behind her, and she straightened her posture as she looked down at the smaller tom. He was enthusiastic now, but when he learned how hard training was on an apprentice, and all the duties he would have to handle, how would he react then? Would he take it in stride? Or would he crumble?

<em>Only time will tell.</em>

<strong>”Do you understand?”</strong>

The behemoth of a ThunderClanner had been idly circling around the clearing in the abandoned quarry ThunderClan had made their residence in. She had been following the sun, trying to chase after the slight warmth of its rays sinking into her thick tresses of mottled fur. Laurelstar was overseeing the affairs of camp, awaiting the various patrols returning from their territory. The fresh-kill pile was steadily remaining filled, despite the season. Her clan was being fed, they’d make it through this season. Yet she knew more challenges would come later on. Issues that would arise for her clan, even if they had recovered for the most part after the landslide and the battle. The start of her leadership was wrought with challenges, one after the other. 

<em>One thing at a time. One thing at a time.</em> she had to remind herself of that mantra often, she couldn’t overburden herself. She had to work with her clan, all together. She didn’t have to take it all on by herself, that’s why she has a deputy, and a whole legion of warriors. She could rely on them for assistance. 

Taking a deep breath, the tortoiseshell sat up from the patch of sun she was laying in. The tortoiseshell ruffled her coat as she stood up, blinking repeatedly as she looked up, checking for any signs of her clanmates. Not many cats were in camp at this time, likely out hunting or on patrol— she’d know, considering she used to organize said patrols.

Staring at the vast expansion of her home before the tiny kitten, made her feel challenged in a way. Her mind saw it as a task, to get out of the crowded nursery and into the wide-world beyond. Bluebellkit ignored her mothers voice in the back of her head, <em>&quot;Stay in your nest, you&#39;ll only end up under the warriors paws.&quot;</em> But as the blue-coated kitten stared out, there weren&#39;t many warriors. She wondered why? Was it bedtime for the warriors? The only den that the kitten could point out to herself was the elders den, and her own. She could only take guesses to what the other dens held. 

So, with cautious yet excited steps, Bluebell moved out of the nursery. The further she got from the entrance the quicker her excited steps got and turning less cautious. Bluebell made it a few hops from the den, Pausing to finally look up at the sky. She let the sun soak into her fur, a calming warmth that she completely accepted. But after a few moments, the calm wore off, and she began looking around again. Who was here? Who could she meet? Could they tell her why there were no warriors in camp?

A curious mind tended to allow for the body to wander on its own. Kits were no exception to this rule, often emerging into the world with an adventurous spirit that goaded them on, to visit each little nook and cranny they found themselves spelunking. She knew that she shared those characteristics as a little kitten, her roaming eyes had scanned across the camp she knew practically like the back of her paws. It seemed that very attitude had implanted itself into the mind of yet another kitten— one who was very young to be venturing out of the nursery and into the snow.

Now <em>that</em> had caught her attention.

The ThunderClan leader’s eyes had widened at the sight, and she trotted towards the young kit, who was much smaller than some of the mounds of snow littering the edges of camp. While today was a little warmer than others, the dripping of melting icicles sending droplets of water falling down made it evident, it still was chilly out. So much so that it could be bad if this kit stayed out for too long, she’d have to make sure she stayed warm until she returned to the nursery. <strong>”Bluebellkit.”</strong> Laurelstar greeted the she-kit with her name, blinking down at her as she towered over the practical infant. <strong>”What are you doing out in camp? It’s a little cold out for a kit your age.”</strong>

The tiny blue kitten heard the snow crunching and turned towards it. One thing her mother had taught her, was who their leader was. <em>&quot;Laurelstar, she served under Icestar, now our leader serves her clan, along with Alerceclaw, we listen to them, and we respect them.&quot;</em>

Bluebellkit&#39;s eyes widened when towering fem greeted her with her name, <strong>&quot;Hi, Laurelstar!&quot;</strong> She did a little hop as she returned her greeting excitedly. <em>Yes! She can answer my questions. Maybe she knows where my mum is too?</em> <strong>&quot;I wanted to explore, the nursery is getting cramped, and my nest keeps getting pushed around. And my mother hasn&#39;t been back for a long time, so I wanted to see what the camp was like!&quot;</strong>

She knew the queens didn&#39;t mean it, she hoped. But they push their nests back so that their kits had more room to play. And a new litter had just been born, so more room was needed. And since Bluebells mother wasn&#39;t around very often, the Queens didn&#39;t have anyone to ask permission to move the nest, rather bypassing the blue and white fem and shoving her nest back.

She was a young leader, in terms of how long she held the position. Judging off of Bluebellkit’s age, she might have been born right at the end of Icestar’s reign, or just as she had started her own. Needless to say, she was <em>very</em> young to be venturing out of the nursery by herself, though she supposed she wasn’t exactly one to judge. As soon as she could perceive her surroundings and actually walk, little Laurelkit was hard to keep in the nursery. She always had been the ambitious sort, striving to explore, striving to be the best— aiming for the top. Now, here she was, gazing out upon her clan, her clanmates, the ones who followed her command, she had made it. All those dreams came true, but not without a great cost. In a way, she was thankful her brother Jasper wasn’t her deputy, that their shared dreams as kits to be a leader and deputy duo hadn’t come true. She didn’t want him to have to have made the decisions she had to, to be put in the positions she found herself in. To lose so much. Not that she didn’t respect Alerceclaw, or would wish that upon him either— she prayed her own deputy would have a relatively calm time serving as her second-in-command, that when his time came to lead he would be ready, and through better circumstances than her rising to her throne.

She blinked repeatedly for a moment, snapping her out of her thoughts that seemed to ensnare her in a fog. She shook her head, now paying attention to Bluebellkit again, who seemed to be happy to see her. <strong>”Pushed around? Is something the matter?”</strong> she tilted her head, she knew queens would occasionally shift their nests around, but for this kit’s sake she figured she’d ask. She didn’t want to hear of any kits being bullied within her camp’s walls, it would not be tolerated. <strong>”As for your mother, she might be on a patrol, either hunting or checking the border. She should be back soon if she was sent on a dawn patrol. Don’t you worry.”</strong> she dipped her skull towards the miniscule, blue-furred kitten staring up at her. A warm, slightly lopsided grin formed on her battle-scarred features. She always enjoyed chatting with the youth of her clan, they all had such varying personalities, especially depending on which generation they belonged to. By no means was she herself old, but she knew there was a clear divide with the cats around her age as compared to those around, for example, Marigolddust’s age, and so on and so forth. Different attitudes, she used to tout about how the senior warriors used to be stuck in their ways and how the clan was stagnating— that they needed to show the other clans who was boss. Now she was trying to keep stability within her clan, keeping the peace for now. <em>I became what I swore to “destroy” back then, these kits will become the same.</em> she inwardly groaned, sometimes looking back on her own past drudged up rather embarrassing memories for her. Bluebellkit and others around her age would learn of this everlasting feeling soon enough, especially after they made embarrassing blunders themselves that would haunt them for the rest of their lives.

The lack of a smile on his new mentor made him slowly realize that maybe he should reel in his excitement. He wouldn&#39;t want to make a fool of himself the moment he became an official apprentice of ThunderClan. So he straightened his posture, though he couldn&#39;t get the excited grin off his face. He wanted to begin training right this very second but he wouldn&#39;t dare argue with Laurelstar. <strong>&quot;I will train extra hard! I&#39;ll put so much effort into it, it will be as if I never was a kittypet! I will do my absolute best, I promise.&quot;</strong>

Raccoonpaw felt overwhelmed with gratitude for the leader in front of him. He was grateful for this cat that would now train him, help him become a true member of the clan. He did not know if this was overstepping but he couldn&#39;t help but purr and press his head against her large chest for a quick moment, an quick action of gratitude, then stepped back with his head raised high.

<strong>&quot;I understand.&quot;</strong>

The tiny kit gave a shrug of her shoulders, &quot;Not really, but sometimes the other kits like to play with my nest since their mothers just move it around to move their own nests.&quot; She wore a neutral expression, still trying to convince herself that it really wasn&#39;t a big deal, just small adjustments. I mean, she was the only one in the nest, so it wasn&#39;t like she took up nor needed that much space. 

But sometimes her tight living arrangements caused Bluebell to crave openness. The urge to just be able to stretch without bumping into anyone sounded amazing. So even if the result was to go out into the open cold, the fem didn&#39;t mind. Her fur gifted her with tough skin to the biting temperatures. 

As the listened to Laurelstar explain where her mum could be, her mind slightly wandered. <em>Patrols? I know Mother told me she likes to go hunting, but whats a patrol? And a border? Is that like what the Queens talk about? How we have so much territory, and a warrior must protect it?</em> <strong>&quot;A dawn patrol? Do they run all the time? She&#39;s always out, the clan must be busy and pretty big since everyone is out all the time. Like-&quot;</strong> She spun quickly, making an open gesture to how empty it seemed, <strong>&quot;No ones here! Is it always like this? We must be awesome.&quot;</strong> And with a nod, the blue she-kit solidified that her clan <em>must</em> be great, since they&#39;re so busy. On these, <em>Dawn patrols.</em>

She could understand the kit’s desire to leave the nursery, she knew the feeling all too well. Even when she was small, pint-sized compared to how gigantic she was now, it felt crammed. Like the world was being kept from her through the bramble and fern walls she had once resided in at her mother’s and siblings’ side. Watching the sunlight filter through the gaps between plant matter, and all the noises she could pick up on outside. She knew it all too well. 

She tilted her head a bit at the kit’s question, before she nodded. <strong>”Chances are she is out hunting, not everyone is in camp currently, though some may just be sleeping still. We run patrols close to dusk and you’d want to be at your sharpest for those when nightfall is near.”</strong> one other reason as to why the camp was quiet currently, patrols didn’t run at every single moment of the day, and once sun-high arrived, the camp would grow to be more lively as patrols returned and more cats rose from their nests. ThunderClan wasn’t exactly a haven for morning-people. She was just used to rising early from her days as deputy, and she didn’t plan on stopping anytime soon. <strong>”We usually run them from dawn, sun-high, and dusk, and we don’t send the same groups out on every patrol. We allow them to rest after their hard work. By hunting, they provide us with our food. By marking our borders, they protect us from threats, keeping kits like you safe.”</strong> she smiled lightly, it was a simple-enough explanation, she hoped. Bluebellkit was just wondering where her mother was and it was likely she was out on a patrol, and would return later on. <strong>”The camp will get more lively in a few hours, just give it time. ThunderClan is loud, trust me.”</strong> she shrugged her broad shoulders, chuckling lightly as she gazed towards the warriors den— her old den.

How many times had she run her mouth out in camp? Had to have been at least five times, she was a rowdy one. Being deputy calmed her down a bit, but she still was a bit of a loudmouth.

Bluebell was filled with nothing short of amazement, her mind pictured the massive warriors making hard treks around the massive territory, all day every day. But instead of saying something close to the wonder she felt, her mouth got ahead of her mind. <strong>&quot;But wouldn&#39;t your paws fall off with that much walking?&quot;</strong> Her tiny voice questioned, lifting up her arm and shaking a tiny white paw. 

She felt exhausted after playing around in the nursery, but after a few minutes rest she was back up and excited. She enjoyed taking her frequent naps, her sleep schedule was very different from the other kittens and Queens. She only guessed that because she spent some nights awake, sitting at the entrance of the nursery, no matter the temperature, just watching the stars. And then spent the day catching up on those missing hours. On the few occasions her mother was sleeping with her, she didn&#39;t seem to notice when the tiny kit slipped out and spent her nightly watching away from her. 

She giggled along with the leader, <strong>&quot;Well the nursery is <em>always</em> loud, no matter the time!&quot;</strong> Bluebell scrunched her nose, <strong>&quot;The smaller kittens interrupt my naps.&quot;</strong> She looked back up to Laurelstar, <strong>&quot;Do you like naps? I think they&#39;re my third favourite thing to do.&quot;</strong></span>

Such innocence, the leader couldn’t help but to envy the na&#239;vet&#233; of the kitten she was conversing with. Unknowing of the hardship the world brought with it, able to live her life with joy and without a care in the world, before she was thrown out there into the forest. Laurelstar understood that with the passage of time, of course kits had to grow up eventually alongside it. They’d grow into apprentices, who would grow into warriors— cats who battled viciously for their clan, cats who had to go hungry, get sick, be injured— sometimes killed. Bluebellkit would learn of their lifestyle in time, she would learn of all these things. As every kit would.

<em>Its sad, in a way.</em>

The tortoiseshell leader curled her bushy tail around her frame as she relaxed into her sitting position, ruffling her coat as she stared down at Bluebellkit. A wistful expression formed on her features for just a moment, and she took a deep breath— the smile returning to her face after she calmed herself. <strong>”No, the warriors are used to it by now. They can travel long distances within a day, and even then a patrol doesn’t cover much ground.”</strong> she shook her head at the kit’s question, before lifting one of her large mittens off of the ground. <strong>”These would have fallen off by now if that was the case!”</strong> another fit of chuckles escaped her lips, her eyes lighting up out of amusement. Her question was a little silly, how many cats in their clan were missing paws from walking anyways? <strong>”As for naps, I like them as much as any other cat, but I don’t often get the chance to take one. I tend to stay awake a lot so I can keep an eye on things around here.”</strong>

She watched how the experienced warriors face changed, the burden that was on her shoulders so large and heavy that for a moment Bluebell felt her mind open and a feeling she could explain wrapped around her heart. She watched her leader for those few seconds as she was snagged away by thoughts beyond the kittens explanation. For just a moment Bluebell wondered what happened beyond her nursery walls. And then the walls beyond that. What happened that she didn&#39;t know about and didn&#39;t see? What terrors was she able to hide from? Unknowingly?

But as soon as that door opened, it closed on her again. Returning back to that excitement and innocence, <strong>&quot;So when I start training, my paws <em>won&#39;t</em> fall off?&quot;</strong> She frowned along with her words, a cheeky giggle bubbling in her nest, <strong>&quot;But if my paws do fall off, I&#39;m gonna tell everyone its your fault.&quot;</strong> The giggle finally escaping. 

She looked upset when Laurelstar said she doesn&#39;t take many naps, <strong>&quot;But thats unfair for you, so not even when you&#39;re tired you can nap? But you&#39;re our leader, you work hard, all the queens tell us that! You should have mandatory naps.&quot;</strong></span>

This kit certainly had a sense of humor, she made her laugh again! <strong>”Alright, alright, you can pin the blame on me if that happens— but I assure you, its not going to. Marigolddust wouldn’t let you overwork yourself to that point.”</strong> she gestured to the medicine cat den up upon one of the slopes around camp. The tom was just too attentive to his patients, and she trusted him implicitly with the care of her clan. He was making for a fine medicine cat, and was positive he’d help keep them safe and secure. Paws intact and all.

Their clan was one big, happy family. That was what made the life worth it in her eyes.

<strong>”Mandatory naps? But what if we’re ambushed by foxes and I need to be awake to fight? You don’t want me to miss a battle, I’m a great fighter.”</strong> she smirked lightly, flexing her claws a bit as she ruffled out her coat. Underneath all that thick fur was a giant of a feline who was able to take and deliver hard blows. She was one of the strongest fighters in the clan— perhaps the strongest now that she was leader and had all of her nine lives currently. She could be taken down and then rise from the dead— finishing her enemies off if she had to. Yet she didn’t know what happened in death, sometimes it took longer whenever someone lost a life— it was an ordeal. Laurelstar hadn’t experienced it just yet. <strong>”I’ll be okay, Bluebellkit. I can rest easy at night knowing I can help keep you all safe. That’s what I do, its what I’m proud to do.”</strong>

Bluebell giggled again, <strong>&quot;I will cherish my paws, but my paws are tough, so I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll ever fall off.&quot;</strong> She hoped she&#39;d turn out like her parents, massive frames. But right now, Bluebell was a fluff ball, and her mother built like a raging bull, fully stacked with muscle and huge paws. 

<strong>&quot;But then you would need to be awake <em>forever</em>, not even Starclan is awake for ever, the elders told me so! But if there are foxes, could I fight them too?&quot;</strong> She looked hopeful, yet still cheeky. She knew she didn&#39;t have the skill set, but it didn&#39;t stop her from blurting out the words. On the very few occasions that the kittens let her join in, she had one her fair share of wrestling matches, and lost the same amount, usually to bigger kittens. 

She smiled as her leader reassured her, <strong>&quot;Will I learn to protect everyone too one day? And l&#39;ll go on the big walks? I see some of the older kits practicing, but they say I&#39;m too <em>little</em> to learn.&quot;</strong> A bit more of a downed look crossed her face at those last few words. And her mother didn&#39;t frequent around the nursery enough to even show her anything, usually coming in to tell her off or take a nap. Bluebell deep down wished for a little more then that.

Bluebellkit seemed <em>insistent</em> on her taking naps occasionally, while she did sleep at night, for the most part the tortoiseshell did remain awake. It wasn’t <em>forever</em>, but she did stay awake longer than most of her clanmates. <strong>”Don’t worry, Bluebellkit. I’ll make sure to get enough rest.”</strong> she flashed her an appreciative smile, glad to know that even the youngest members of her clan were looking out for others. It warmed her heart. <strong>”Maybe when you’re older, and know how to fight. Foxes are dangerous, and they can really hurt little kits like you.”</strong> she frowned lightly, the thought of a fox trying to attack the youth of her clan was disturbing. She’d defend them to the death if she had to, but foxes were tenacious and cunning creatures. In order to truly drive them off, one needed to deliver a vicious beating to them that they would never forget. Laurelstar had to ensure her clanmates would be safe. Including kits like Bluebellkit, she wouldn’t be sending <em>infants</em> off into battle.

The kit was eager to learn of her future, and she’d happily tell he <strong>One day, you’ll be able to fight alongside the warriors, and go on patrols. You’ll be much bigger by then, and you’ll even get to meet cats from outside our clan.”</strong> she gazed out to the camp entrance, Bluebellkit didn’t know what the other clans were truly like. She hadn’t met anyone outside of their clan yet, at least she highly doubted the kit met Beanspark, one of the SkyClan medicine cats, while he was on a visit here.

        As the tortoiseshell Matriarch informed the pushy blue kitten, her face fell slightly, <strong>&quot;Can I practise anything? I want to be ready for my apprentice hood! The older kittens practise sometimes, is there <em>anything</em> I can do?&quot;</strong> She wanted to learn at least something, even if it was small, she felt bored on her lonely days, and to fill it with something that she could use one day to protect her home? To prove to the other kits she was worth their time? It made the kittens heart clench, but even as she wanted that, she also wanted to go back to the nursery, and sort out the rocks in her nest again. A simple task that had been etched into Bluebells mind as she repeated the task, usually something she did to calm herself down. 

        <strong>&quot;Cats from, <em>outside?</em> You mean there&#39;s more!&quot;</strong> Her mind couldn&#39;t even <em>imagine,</em> that many cats. To think that the tons of cats here, and there&#39;s just, <em>more?</em> But then she would be big, <em>like Laurelstar?</em> Her mind whispered. But the kitten&#39;s mouth once again got ahead of her, <strong>&quot;I&#39;d be big like you?&quot;</strong> She imagined herself, looking down at her tiny body, going into the size of the fearsome warrior.

While it was true they could not truly “train” the kits of the clan, Laurelstar didn’t see the harm in showing them basic skills. She’d taught kits how to crouch and stalk, even if they were almost always wobbly and uncoordinated, they almost always employed those same skills in the games they played. Laurelstar wouldn’t mind showing her a few skills. <strong>”Well… I can show you how to properly pounce, or how to swipe correctly.”</strong> the better the form they had in battle, the greater the effectiveness of the attack. However, she just hoped this kit would only use this for play purposes for now. <strong>”Watch me.”</strong> she dipped her skull to the blue-furred kitten, taking a few steps back to prepare for her demonstration. The tortoiseshell deputy ruffled out her thick coat, before stretching out for a moment— never hurt to warm up a bit before an exhibition, even if it was for a simple paw swipe. Besides, she figured it may make her look “cooler” to the kitten. 

She rose her paw up into the air, before swinging it downward. Quick and precise, no hesitation in any way.

<strong>”Got that? You can try that out, just if you’re practicing avoid using your claws around camp. We never train with our claws out.”</strong> she nodded her head, before the kitten’s next comment caught her attention— a good segue into the next topic. <strong>”We save the claws for our enemies, which can also be cats from outside our clan, if they threaten us. However, we try to avoid conflict if possible. Most of the time the other clans mind their business, as do we with their affairs.”</strong> a smirk formed once again, and she couldn’t help but to chuckle. <strong>”If you grow as big as me, that might give the other clans reasons to not mess with us!”</strong>

        Bluebell watched Laurelstar practise the swipe, the tiny kitten looked at the warrior&#39;s paw, then her own small one. She flexed her paw for a moment, claws poking out, but quickly hidden away as her next words came. <em>&quot;We don&#39;t train with our claws out.&quot;</em> She nodded. For a moment she didn&#39;t understand why she would say something like that, but then it clicked, <em>I could accidentally hurt someone, and if I&#39;m practising in the nursery, I could hit a kit</em> 

        She nodded along with her words, her mind softly worrying about other clans. Whilst she wanted to know how to fight, a part of her was scared at the idea of having to actually do it. 

        She giggled at Laurelstars words, <strong>&quot;The other clans will definitely run away when I grow big!&quot;</strong>

Bluebellkit seemed pleased with the fact she was able to swipe properly now, mimicking her own display in her own fashion. The ThunderClan matriarch wasn’t going to show her anything complex, but she figured this would come up in the games she’d play with other kits. Why not show her the ropes so she could get used to it ahead of time? Give her an advantage over some of the kits in the nursery she was playing with, or at least put her on the same playing field as the older ones. Bluebellkit didn’t seem like the type to abuse the power she just granted her, and if she did, well she was sure the proper discipline would be issued. She didn’t want to hear of any kittens with torn ears and the like. However, she was sure it wouldn’t go that far. <strong>”Yep, just like how they start running the moment I show up. I’m sure they’ll be sprinting even faster the moment you appear!”</strong> she chuckled, her bushy tail swaying around behind her excitedly. She knew she was exaggerating, but why would she want to ruin a kit’s fun?

<strong>”You’ll learn more when you become an apprentice, trust me. Any one of the warriors who may mentor you in the future are all talented and will ensure you’re going to be one of the best.”</strong> she always spoke very highly of her clanmates, and the ones who stood up against threats outside and within were all trustworthy. These were the most loyal group of warriors in the world, she believed, they were willing to give life and limb to protect their clan. She couldn’t thank them enough for everything they did, and how grateful she was to lead them… Now she was just being a softie.

Time seemed to be rolling by slowly, at least for him. In the moons since the battle the tom was just going about his days in autopilot, a blank expression on his features half the time. The battle had taken a toll on him, on his family. He continually checked in on his mother, trying to see if he could elicit some sort of reaction from her— that somehow it would trigger her memory. That she would remember him.

<em>What a way to be almost entering warriorhood.</em>

The tom let out a sigh as his shoulders sagged, not even touching the mouse he’d picked up from the fresh-kill pile— it was practically skin and bones anyways, almost no actual meat on there… Maybe he just wasn’t hungry, he’d go put it back in a moment. Coyotepaw was just swimming in unpleasant thoughts and memories… Then he recalled something, Wrenpaw. She too faced an ordeal for moons, and he never stopped to check in on her after it all. He assumed she wanted space after it all came out about her acting as a spy on their clan’s behalf. Couple that with the situation regarding his mother, it caused them to give each other space. Still, he owed it to his friend that he check on her, at least whenever he saw her next.

Life among Thunderclan had finally seemed to settle since the war against the Dark Forest, rebuilding their clan and lives and now carrying on in general peace. Though the challenges of leaf-bare still remained, it was clear that the harsh season would be coming to an end in due time, as prey was becoming more plentiful, the sun shone brighter and the days seemed a little less chilly. Even so, snow still laid upon the earth and icicles reached down from the branches overhead. Nonetheless, it was still pleasing to be returning to that which was familiar, normal even.
    A russet figure appeared slinking into the camp, amber eyes bright as he looked over the area he called home. A sigh escaped from him as he padded toward the fresh-kill pile, dropping his catch among it before turning away. He stood idly as he took a moment to take in the sight of the camp once more - it was quiet. The occasional figure could be seen among it, here and there a mentor and apprentice was readying for a training session, while others chatted among themselves. The warrior decided he ought to take what time he could to rest for a few moments, lest he be dragged along on some sort of patrol or approached by another clanmate. So, he headed over toward a fairly open spot, before lying down and resting his head on his paws.

The creamy feline slipped out of the warriors den, having already gone hunting earlier, she had decided to take a short nap in her nest to rest her eyes. Ever since the fight against the Dark Forest, it had been a bit difficult for her to sleep, but now that everything seemed to be slowly getting back to normal, she hoped that would end up changing. Slowly glancing around camp, her chocolate gaze landed on a russet tom lounging in an area by himself. A small smile adorned her face before she padded over to him. 
<strong>&quot;Hey Cardinalspark.&quot;</strong> She murmured softly as she approached, not wanting to disrupt him too much in case he wanted to be alone. It had been hard for them to find any alone time together since the battle, but that was to be expected with how intense everything had been. And plus they both had received injuries and had needed to recover in their own time before returning back to normal duties. <strong>&quot;How are you today?&quot;</strong> She asked with a sheepishly glance.

All was finally at peace for her clan. Their camp was restored to its former glory, with some marked improvements, and all those who suffered injuries had recovered-- physically speaking at least. She knew the mental and emotional turmoil the battle had wrought upon her clanmates, as well as herself, would not go away so easily. She knew that it would take time for many to truly adapt to some sense of normalcy after losing so many loved ones, herself included. Her own family was coping, sticking close together, though she knew her kits were still struggling. She admired their tenacity in the face of a tragedy, but she wished that they never had to cope with losing their mother at so young of an age... Just like her.

One thing she was thankful for was that the leader she had served under had survived. Even if she didn&#39;t remember her.

The tortoiseshell sovereign could see the lynx-point down in the camp from where she stood upon the Highledge, gazing down at her clanmates below. She had given her some space since the battle, to try and allow her to get her own bearings on the world she was thrown into. No need to overwhelm someone in an amnesiac state, to Iceheart, she really was nothing more than a stranger, or perhaps an acquaintance who had addressed her as leader once. Now she didn&#39;t know what to call her, would they ever be friends again? She prayed they could be, even if she was now the one in charge of leading the clan, and Iceheart served her as a warrior.

<em>I pray she regains some of her memories, there are cats here who love and cherish the time they spent with her. I want her to know what her sacrifice meant to me.</em>

She wouldn&#39;t even be standing on this rock if it weren&#39;t for her.

Taking a deep breath, the tortoiseshell began to descend her throne and into the clearing down below, her gaze trained on the pale-furred she-cat. Approaching her slowly, Laurelstar greeted her by name: <strong>&quot;Hello, Iceheart. Can we talk?&quot;</strong>

These past moons were tough on Iceheart. Laying low, the silvery-white femme slowly adjusted to the daily life of the Clan under the close watch of Bearmask. She had stayed away from the funerals held for the lost warriors in the battle.  She didn’t remember them. She didn’t know them. She couldn’t grieve for them. She didn’t even know her own kits! The awkwardness to that discovery has stuck quite prominently. Staying quiet was the best thing she could do; a silent presence barely flickering within the Clan. 

Iceheart’s head shot up immediately when her name was called. A slow blink portrayed her confusion as ThunderClan’s leader, Laurelstar, summoned her. She hadn’t spoken to her ever since the lynx-point had first woken up after the battle. It was best that way especially for a leader as busy as her. 

<em>Why does she want to speak with me?</em> It was quite a wonder. Besides her curiosity, she couldn’t refuse her leader’s request. Standing up obediently, Iceheart nodded in confirmation. <strong>” Of course.”</strong>

A silent presence was satisfying for some warriors, but for a cat like Iceheart, she didn’t think it suited a warrior of her caliber. A hero of their clan. A leader who gave up her lives, one of her souls, to allow her clan to triumph over their enemies. She couldn’t be more thankful for her actions, and she owed it to her to ensure she was recovering— to still consider her a friend. <strong>”I just wanted to chat, no need for the formalities.”</strong> a large white mitten gestured to the way the lynx-point she-cat had straightened her posture in her presence. She commanded respect, but she didn’t need to hear an audible <em>crack</em> every single time she addressed her clanmates.

<strong>”How are you feeling?”</strong> her head slightly tilted, her gaze showcasing hints of concern— though it was evident she was pleased to see the pale she-cat out and about in camp. She didn’t want to swarm her with questions, to bombard her with reminders of memories that were from the leader’s perspective, and not her own. Laurelstar had reacted out of panic during the battle, shocked by the fact she didn’t remember her. The cat whose life she traded the rest of her lives and her soul for. <em>I can’t hold that against her, she didn’t know that would happen. I owe it to her to keep the clan safe, that includes her.</em> her ears twitched as she waited for some form of answer. Her thoughts were just swimming around in her mind erratically, bumping into each other or merging  into amorphous shapes like a  school of sardines out in the ocean.

       Not innately someone with a stern demeanor, Alerce needed only a second of relief as he made his way down to camp for the second time this day. The camp held so many memories - as it would for anyone his age with the life he governed. The life he invited so many others into. But alas - and not that he was old, in fact he was a middle age warrior. Alas. He was the last one standing. Everyone he had ever known to be a friend or anything of the sort had died or resorted to something like IceHeart was now. This brobdingnagian was still unsure with how IceHeart had gotten to the state, but he knew the fae he knew before no longer resided in that husk anymore. He was unfamiliar to her just as much as she was to him. Though he substantial advice was still remembered. The one IceStar had given him. Not IceHeart. See, there was a thing about memories. They were always only your mind replaying an important event. Only ever that. Emphasizing the past and how quickly time can fly. And if you let time fly by, you will come to realize how many regrets you would gain. 
    But enough of that, Tigerpaw had to be analyzed on this training session. He already got quite enough from just greeting her earlier. She was the clans princess. And as tragic as it was; being raised by one parent only since recently the other had passed, Tiger has yet to portray any symptoms to that. Even something as simple as no reaction at all can say something about her. But for now; she remained a timid, ambitious, and nervous little thing in this bachelors mind. As some apprentices normally start out. 
    Unfortunately, that will have to change if they were to successfully get through training with him.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>Wrenpaw</strong>
<u>ThunderClan Apprentice</u>

The days all seemed to morph together as Wrenpaw awaited the day she would finally become a warrior, though she wasn’t feeling as excited about it as she had in the past. She couldn’t pinpoint exactly why, and she knew that she <em>should</em> be happier,  but she found herself feeling rather indifferent. Wrenpaw knew she was ready. In fact, she was more than ready. Her injuries sustained from the dark forest battle had put a delay on her training, which had held her back nearly two moons. Now she was back and stronger than ever, physically at least. Mentally, the dark thoughts of what had happened and the nightmares still took their toll on the young she-cat, though she did her best to keep all of that beneath the surface. The only thing that really <em>looked</em> different about her was her scarred appearance. Nearly half her ear was gone, and thick scars could be seen on her neck and around her shoulders. Still, she carried them proudly. She liked to think they make her look more intimidating, which would be a good thing considering she’d always looked as soft and gentle as a newborn. 

As she she-cat slipped from the apprentices den, her dark amber gaze landed almost immediately on Coyotepaw, and right away she felt overcome with guilt. She knew he’d been going through a difficult time with his mother after the battle, and she’d chosen to give him space rather than be present. It was partially because she had needed time to get control of her own traumas, but also because she didn’t know how to help her friend and she worried she’d only bother him. She was always so desperate to help those around her, especially those that she cared for deeply, but mostly the things she wanted to help with were things she was powerless against. Still, there wasn’t a day that went by where she didn’t think about the tom. He looked quite miserable now, poking at his mouse. Wrenpaw hurried over to him, trying her best to look cheerful in hopes it would make him feel a little better. <strong>”Hi,”</strong> she said softly, sitting down and wrapping her tail around her paws. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

Almost as if he’d summoned her with a mere thought, Wrenpaw appeared before him, greeting him quietly. His brown-tipped ears flickered as he picked his head up, meeting her gaze. Even in a minuscule amount, he looked visibly less drained upon seeing his friend, and a phantom of a smile could be seen on his muzzle. <strong>”Hey, Wrenpaw.”</strong> he returned the greeting, his voice was low and he stared back down at his uneaten mouse, before he pushed it towards her. <strong>”Do you want this? I grabbed it and I just realized I’m not really hungry.”</strong> that wasn’t exactly true, this season left everyone hungry, skinnier than usual as many had less meals than they would have had before. For cats like him, with their lean, lanky builds, he looked more bony than usual— more of his ribs poked out. Not emaciated, not yet anyhow, but right now with all his anxiety-ridden thoughts, he just couldn’t stomach anything right about now. Better it went to someone else than to be wasted entirely.

He let out a small sigh, his sage-colored gaze sweeping across the repaired camp, and then to the new scars he saw on her form. It was like the battle never had happened, so many were returning to their normal routines, just enjoying their existences and being <em>alive</em>. Yet there were still reminders everywhere, including his own scars he had sustained in the fight. <strong>”How’ve you been? Its been a long time since we talked last.”</strong> it was a bit awkward, but he didn’t avoid her because he was upset with her. He understood why she had to keep that secret from him now. It was for her own safety, but even then, she was detained by those evil traitors, she could have died. He was glad she had made it through, they were best friends, had been since they were kits. Of course he was glad she was here, that she was all right.

A quick flick of her ear indicated her surprise to Laurelstar’s proposal. The lynx-point followed, snow crunching under her paws. She couldn’t help but admire the proud composure of the ginger-and-white. Her dedication to the Clan was clear. <em>She must have been a very good deputy.</em> If only she could remember. The back of her head gave a slight ache. Iceheart swallowed uneasily, fighting back the tears of frustration every time there was no recollection. 

She barely heard Laurelstar’s question about her current well-being. Looking up, Iceheart gave an empty blink. <strong>” What were you asking?”</strong> Her tufted ears folded tightly back against her head in embarrassment. The two of them were talking for the first time in many moons and this was how it started off. The pale fur on her shoulders prickled uneasily. How she wished to escape this very moment!

To see her behave so defensive, almost as if she were about to run made the leader take a step back for a moment— more hints of concern flooding her gaze as she saw the lynx-point’s fur rise up a bit out of uneasiness. <strong>”I was just wondering how you were feeling. Are you recovering after the battle?”</strong> she had sustained wounds as Icestar, and while losing lives would heal the grievous ones, she assumed she too had sought treatment for the less pressing ones afterwards. Everyone had been bloodied, battered, and bruised. It was a fact of life when it came to battle. No one was immune to injury, not unless they had some form of power granted to them from StarClan that shielded them from harm.

<em>But that’s nearly impossible. Haven’t had a case of that for hundreds of generations, in any clan for that matter.</em>

Still, Iceheart had been a special case, having two souls encased in one body. It was a strange and bizarre occurrence, but it was able to keep her once-friend alive, and she was thankful for it. Now it was up to them to help her back onto her paws and try to recover lost time and memories. She owed it to her for everything she had done for both her and the clan. <strong>”You don’t have to answer me, I know it must be difficult getting used to this”</strong> but she truly didn’t understand. She wasn’t the one with lost memories.

A twist of guilt strangled her chest at the worry in the leader’s mismatched eyes. <strong>” I don’t mind answering.”</strong> She was relieved that Laurelstar was understanding of her situation. The fur on her shoulders settled back down. 

<strong>” I’ve been good,”</strong> Iceheart assured. <strong>” It’s been-”</strong> she searched for the right word, <strong>” tough.”</strong> The lynx-point wasn’t going to lie about this. Even if she did, no one would believe her. <strong>” But, I’m managing.”*</strong> 

Her sea-foam eyes dragged over her own pristine silvery coat. <strong>” I was able to make it out with no injuries. When I asked Marigolddust, he said it was because I lost a life, many lives, and my body regenerates every time it does so.”</strong> It was still a confusing concept. She couldn’t imagine having nine lives nor Laurelstar who stood right before her. Apparently, everyone is bestowed nine lives once they rise to the ranks of a leader. Well, nearly everyone. The gentle medicine cat had mentioned a few exceptions to that rule.

She could see that the ordeal had worn Iceheart down, being thrown into the fray of a wild, disorganized conflict, not knowing who was friend or foe would be disorienting for sure. Laurelstar was thankful she had made it out without any injuries sustained, the one benefit of having nine lives, if the wound wasn’t grievous enough, one could be healed from it in due time. Still, it didn’t mean witnessing a cat die and come back from the dead wasn’t a bit disturbing, she’d seen it happen a few times with Icestar. To think she’d be going through something like that eventually, her luck would run out sometime.

<em>To know what death is like, and to come back from it? Its scary.</em>

<strong>”If you ever want to talk about it, I’m always here. I can even try to explain a few things if you want, but I’m not going to make you listen to me.”</strong> a faint, half-hearted smile formed on her features, she genuinely sympathized with the she-cat she was conversing with. She prayed she could heal from this, to recover in any way possible, just to provide some clarity to her. <strong>”The most I can really talk about is the time I spent serving under you as a warrior and a deputy though, before that we actually didn’t talk much. You knew my father though.”</strong> she wouldn’t remember Featherpelt, and her heart lurched for a moment. Her father’s death was tough on her, he was the closest member of family she had in the clan, besides her children. Featherpelt was practically beloved by almost all cats he spoke with, kind and gentle, a rare thing to find nowadays.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><strong>Wrenpaw</strong>
<u>ThunderClan Apprentice</u>

Wrenpaw was glad that she could bring a smile to her friends lips, but it was a mere ghost of his normal smile. She hadn’t expected much different, truthfully. Coyotepaw had endured a lot in the recent moons, and it was unlikely that any cat would be cheerful after having such experiences. She wanted the tom to know how much she cared, though she didn’t really want to bring up such a sensitive subject. Instead, she simply stared back at him for a while, amber gaze brimming with emotion. For someone who usually had so much to say, Wrenpaw was unusually silent, fumbling through words in her mind. She looked from her friend to the scrawny mouse at his paws and then back again, biting her lip softly. He <em>needed</em> to eat, but he didn’t have any appetite, and she could understand that. Still, she wondered if she could coax him to even have a bite. <strong>”I ate this morning,”</strong> she lied quickly. Wrenpaw was a notoriously bad liar, unless of course she felt like she was lying to help someone she cared about. <strong>”It is tiny, though. Maybe we could share? It’s no more than a couple bites a piece anyways.”</strong> She observed. Her stomach growled audibly, her face flushing as embarrassment washed over her. As unappetizing as the mouse was, it was still food, and as much as she might deny it, the apprentice was quite hungry. 

She shifted a bit on her paws, her gaze quickly finding anywhere else to rest besides upon Coyotepaw. 

<em>How’ve you been?</em>

Despite the time that had passed, the golden furred she-cat still wasn’t certain how to answer that question. <strong>”Well I’ve been… better. I still have nightmares but good luck finding many clanmates that don’t.”</strong> She said with a small shrug. She was still plagued with a plethora of bad memories, but at least the actual threat was gone. <strong>”I’m sorry for keeping my distance. It’s just, everyone who wasn’t there seems to want to know what it was like being a spy, like it was something exciting or something to be proud of. I didn’t want to tell anyone, at least not until I told you. I promised I’d tell you when I could, but I’m still sorry I kept it from you.”</strong> She began. She traced a single claw to and fro across the ground, trying to distract herself from the building anxiety that she felt. She brought her gaze back to her friend, for a few moments, at least. 

It wasn’t like her trauma outweighed his in any way. Sure, she’d seen plenty of cats die, but none that she held close. She had been lucky in that sense. Even the fact that she’d nearly died didn’t seem to hold a candle to what some of her clanmates had lost. <strong>”I’m sorry for what happened. How is she doing? Your mother, I mean. More importantly, how are you holding up?”</strong> Wrenpaw knew there was no real way she could help her friend in his struggle, but at least she could be there for him to show support. He probably had a lot of things on his mind that he was holding onto. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

Now with seemingly peaceful moons ahead, the russet warrior would have more than enough time to recover from the battle. At some point, the tom&#39;s eyes had managed to flutter close in the following moments after he&#39;d settled down, leaving him in a partial slumber. The rays of the sun above danced upon the reddish pelt, causing it to glow a bright, almost red-orange. It was a welcoming feeling despite the snow underneath him and he would gladly treasure such a feeling for as long as he could. Though this would quickly come to an end beforelong - a sudden voice breaking into his light moment of sleep, stirring him awake quite easily.
    Blinking, the tom&#39;s gaze fell upon the familiar, cream-colored pelt ot Honeydrop. His whiskers quivered for a moment as the tom raised his head, allowing for a yawn to escape him. <strong>&quot;Hello, Honeydrop. Caught me at a rather...unprofessional time.&quot;</strong> he replied in turn, a playful smile upon his face. <strong>&quot;I assure you though, I had done some duties earlier so I am indeed far from slacking, so no worries there.&quot;</strong> he added after a moment, with a light chuckle.
    <strong>&quot;Anyways...I&#39;m doing alright. Hunted a bit earlier and then settled down for a short rest. How about you?&quot;</strong> he inquired, forcing himself up into a sitting position before stretching out his limbs.

It was rather early this particular morning, the golden disk of the sun just beginning to rise upon the horizon, signaling that dawn had arrived. Morning frost still clung onto the various surrounding plants and earth alike, though with the snow already laying upon the ground, it wasn&#39;t easy to spot at first glance. There was the occasional sound of something skittering about among the undergrowth or trees, but in general, the morning was silent; save for the twittering and chirping of birds.
    A golden-shaded figure appeared at the entrance to the warriors den, pale eyes scanning the rather empty camp before him. A cat could be seen here and there, but a majority of the tom-cat&#39;s clanmates were still among their dens. Nonetheless, the warrior padded out into the camp, toward the fresh-kill pile to grab something for himself. The tom then hurried away with it, settling down a short distance away before digging into it.

The flickering sun peeked over the white horizon, snow glistening as the light projected against it. A bicolored gaze watched over the calm campsite with solemn caution. Her large audits swiveled back, before circling forward once more. Palelilly hadn&#39;t slept a wink, her brain racing with questions revolving her sister&#39;s disappearance. Why did nobody seem to care that her sister was gone but her? The pale calico femme was conflicted. Her brows furrowed as she watched a tom rush away from the fresh kill pile as if ravenously hungry. 

Palelilly slowly made her way to the pile, grabbing a small bird for herself before peeking over towards the brute once more. Figuring a conversation could never hurt, the bubbly femme pranced over, her tail held high. She sat about a cat&#39;s length away, and began picking feathers from her prey in order to get a decent bite. &quot;G&#39;morning!&quot; She meowed after a while towards the cat; she believed she remembered his name to be Flickerfog? No- Flickerfox? Palelilly couldn&#39;t be sure. She curled her long tail over her paws and took a satisfying bite of the bird.

A sheepish look adorned her features as the creamy feline realized she had ended up disturbing the poor tom’s rest. <strong>”I’m really sorry, Cardinalspark. I had not meant to disrupt your nap. I’m sure you’re really tired, but I just wanted to check in on you.”</strong> She admitted softly, a shy smile on her face as she gazed at him with her chocolate orbs. She felt bad about waking him up, but she supposed there was no going back now, though she would not linger long so he could quickly get back to his resting. Hearing his comment, she purred softly in response as she giggled faintly. <strong>”I do not doubt your lack of fulfilling duties. You’re the last cat that I would think of who would skip out on their warrior duties.”</strong> She mused, settling in her spot. 

<strong>”I was on border patrol earlier, and then did some hunting a little bit ago to try and help add to the fresh-kill pile. I can’t wait for the warmer weather to return so everyone’s bellies will be filled again.”</strong> Honeydrop murmured softly, knowing how the colder moons was always hard on everyone, especially the elders and the kits, and even though they were always looked after, she still couldn’t help but worry. It was just the type of feline she was.

While his injuries were nowhere near as severe as hers was, time had taken its toll on this young, soon-to-be warrior. Absent-mindedly going through his training, just trying to count the days until he would receive his warrior name. Still, it was clear he was simply just <em>out of it</em>. Just tired, scared for the future because he didn’t know if things ever could be the same again, for anyone. It was a giant unknown, something he couldn’t work through with his own logic alone.

<strong>”It’s fine Wrenpaw, I’m not upset you didn’t tell me. I can understand why you couldn’t.”</strong> he flashed her a sympathetic gaze, his ears flickering as he let out a small sigh. Of course he wanted to know, he could have tried to help her, but she would have been putting herself in danger. He wouldn’t want that in the slightest. Then, the question about his mother caused him to pick his head up a bit, and he visibly grew a bit more uncomfortable. Not because she had asked, but the situation as a whole was painful for him. <strong>”She still doesn’t remember me.”</strong> he sounded drained, exhausted in his attempts to try and jog her memory. Trying to have her remember his collection habits, who his siblings were, trying to help his father out with triggering memories for her. Nothing was changing, and he was panicking at the thought that his mother may never ever remember him— her son. That was the biggest beast preying on his subconscious currently, that was what was weighing down on his mind, distracting him.

He just wanted to know if she could ever see him as her son again. To somehow remember.

<strong>”I don’t know what’s going to happen, its just… It’s bothering me and I keep thinking that she may never get her memories back. My father has been taking care of her a lot but there’s only so much one cat can do. I’m worried for both of them.”</strong> he spoke highly of his family, he cared deeply about them. Even if he wasn’t the mostly outwardly affectionate cat in the world, he still regarded the cats he had deep connections to with admiration. This situation was so dire and grim that it was evoking bigger reactions from him, he was <em>petrified.</em>

Iceheart felt gratitude towards the offer. She was curious about her former memories and wondered what she was like as ThunderClan’s leader. How was she like to Laurelstar? What relationship did she have with Laurelstar’s father? She didn’t even know his name! The silvery-white molly’s positive attitude dimmed. Would it really help if she knew all that? Would it bring up painful memories best left forgotten? Maybe it was better for her to restart with a clean slate. 

<strong>” I’m scared of knowing about my past life,”</strong> she admitted carefully. <strong>” I don’t know…”</strong> Her voice trailed off, hesitance lacing her tone. <em>Should I really say it?</em> However, some instinct inside her assured her that Laurelstar was someone she could trust unconditionally. <strong>” I don’t know if it matters if I knew about it or not. I don’t want others to think I can be that same cat I was before just because I now know about my past.”</strong>

She could understand why the apprehension the lynx-point was experiencing was occurring. This could have been an opportunity in disguise, for the soul who had laid dormant within the body she shared with that of Icestar to finally experience life. She didn’t know the pain or the harsh experiences her predecessor knew of, a fresh, clean slate. Yet that also came with a price, the relations she had with many cats all at once were also seemingly starting back up at square one… Could it ever truly be the same as it was? Would they ever be the same friends again?

<em>I pray to StarClan it can be so.</em>

<strong>”I’m not saying you should act the same, that’s a choice for you to make… Still, don’t you feel entitled to know what happened?”</strong> she meant it in a way that she deserved to know what happened to her, it was something <em>she</em> experienced. Laurelstar blinked, slightly frowning as she let out a sigh. She didn’t want to overstep her bounds, StarClan forbid she make things worse because she treated the situation with less sensitivity than she should have. <strong>”I know it’s scary for you, and you should know there are cats who are looking out for you. They care about you, and want to know that you’re going to be okay.”</strong> she spoke with sincerity, curling her bushy tail around her frame. Her gaze absent-mindedly looked up to the sky for a moment, wondering what else was to come for them. So many things to worry about all at once. It was hard to keep track of it.

As time passed, more felines began to appear among the camp, gathering into various clusters or settling in pairs, save for the lone feline scattered about here and there. They were all of various ages, sizes and colors, a perfect painting among the golden dawn light. Pale optics rested upon the camp for some time, lazily scanming across it though at the same time, harboring a cunning glint among them. A pink tongue swiped across his muzzle, collecting stray bits of prey as he glanced down - realizing that such was nearly gone. He paused for a moment at this, contemplating the situation, before something caught his attention.
   Out of the corner of his eye, the tom spotted a figure approaching. A slender calico molly, posessing a morning meal of her own. The warrior&#39;s gaze rested upon her for a moment, silver optics gleaming with mild interest. As she settled herself a short distance away, sparing him a greeting a short moment afterwards, the tom&#39;s whiskers quivered.
    <strong>&quot;Good morning...&quot;</strong> he replied slowly, ears held erect. <strong>&quot;Palelily, correct? You look lovely today.&quot;</strong> he added after a moment, a small smile resting upon his face. <strong>&quot;How&#39;re you today? Are you well?&quot;</strong> he inquirer, tail flicking about behind him as he studied her from a distance. As far as he knew, the calico was a rather friendly feline and nothing to truly worry about conversing with - unless, she was the overly talkative type anyway.

<em>Don’t you feel entitled to know what happened?</em> Iceheart mulled over this thought. It wasn’t as if she was reborn. That cat before her memory loss was the same one who was standing here right now. Acting as if those two are separate wasn’t going to solve problems. In fact, it would be avoiding them. Even if she hadn’t realized it herself, she needed her identity. She had been feeling so lost these past moons that the emptiness was getting to her. Additionally, if she wasn’t going to do it for her own sake, she should do it for the others. According to Laurelstar, there were a lot who cared about her. The least she could do was try in some way. 

<strong>” Being a leader is busy, but do you think you can help me with some battle training?”</strong> The lynx-point suddenly asked. <strong>” No memory means I don’t remember any training I’ve had. I still want to be useful to the Clan, even if it’s like this.”</strong> Her tail flicked erratically, as if contemplating something. <strong>” And,”</strong> she began slowly. <strong>” Could you also tell me about your father? And what he meant to me?”</strong>

Iceheart didn’t seem offended by her own presumption, which brought the leader a sense of relief. She smiled lightly, the request to train alongside her was one she’d accept readily. Laurelstar had sparred with the lynx-point she-cat before, and they had their own share of competitions in the past. She nodded to the pale-furred she-cat, gleefully obliging to her request. <strong>”Of course!”</strong> she chirped aloud, her tail tip swishing around quickly. Maybe this was an opportunity in disguise, a callback to a previous time where they trained. Maybe it could bring some sense of nostalgia for her, it could possibly help.

The mention of her father made the excitement stall for a moment, but she was still smiling. He was gone, but she’d still speak of his legacy to all of those who were interested in hearing it. Especially from someone he was good friends with in life. <strong>”My father’s name was Featherpelt. He was known for taking in many kits and raising them as his own, because of that I actually have a lot of adoptive siblings.”</strong> she was one of the very few kits of his that were related to him by blood, she was one of the kits he had with Tigereyes. <strong>”He was being considered for deputy under Hawkstar’s reign along with you, and you two were quite friendly with one another, and worked well with each other. He was quite happy when you were appointed as deputy of ThunderClan.”</strong> she spoke highly of the tom, he was known for his kind disposition and calm personality. He looked after almost everyone in the clan, a cat who was trusted by all, and had a good reputation even outside of ThunderClan’s walls. It was rare to find such a cat nowadays, she didn’t know if it was even possible to find a cat like her father. He was unique, a true paragon of his kind. <strong>”He was happy serving ThunderClan, and was one of the most loyal cats I have ever seen. He was dedicated to the clan, and by extension, your leadership.”</strong>

Hearing the cream-furred feline&#39;s apology, Cardinalspark grinned a tad, shaking his head. <strong>&quot;Oh no, you&#39;re more than alright. I can always spare a moment for you, Honeydrop.&quot;</strong> the tom purred, dark ears twitching. He observed the opposing feline for a moment, whiskers quivering as she continued, a light bit of laughter escaping the russet tom. <strong>&quot;Ah, that&#39;s good to know then. I have an image to uphold, after all.&quot;</strong>
    As he settled down once more, the russet warrior listened to the molly&#39;s words. Such would be appreciated - now that they were free from the ideals of war, all they needed to truly recover was for leaf-bare to release them of its harsh season. Day by day, it&#39;s chilling grip seemed to lessen, making way for warmer days and bountiful prey. The tom could hardly wait for such times to grace them - he&#39;d missed hunting in those conditions, despite his longer pelt, he wasn&#39;t fond of the snow. <strong>&quot;I must say, I&#39;m looking forward to it, myself. That was one of the things keeping me from bringing back something extra for you - that and the fact I hadn&#39;t known you&#39;d be looking for me today. I might&#39;ve looked a tad silly hurrying through camp with an extra bit of prey, only for you not to show...though I suppose someone else would&#39;ve enjoyed it all the same.&quot;</strong>
    Noticing he&#39;d been rambling onward about this meal, the tom&#39;s ears laid back slightly, a sheepish smile resting upon his face. <strong>&quot;My apologies. I just...want to make sure you&#39;re alright and all. I don&#39;t want you catching colds or anything, while you&#39;re trying to help out.&quot;</strong> he replied, referring to the last time she&#39;d gotten sick, a playful yet equally concerned light among his gaze.

As the sun rose high into the bright blue skies above them all, the camp was filled with energy and activity as its inhabitants were awake for the middle of the day. Today would mark a special occasion for some of her clan’s younger members, a promotion, and it was a special one. They would be adding two new warriors to their ranks, so this was to be a celebratory affair. With that in mind, the burly tortoiseshell sovereign of ThunderClan slipped out of her den upon the Highledge and stepped out onto the perch that overlooked her clan’s camp. She cleared her throat, before rallying her clan with a loud cry:

<strong>”Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey gather beneath the Highledge!”</strong>

Confidence and authority permeated her tone, her clanmates were to appear for this ceremony and support those who were being promoted. This was a part of their recovery, and these two cats had worked hard to earn their names and ranks. It was high time they were promoted at last. With that being said, she sat down at the edge of her throne, looking down at the growing crowd below, their expectant eyes trained on her now that she had their undivided attention.

At the call of the ThunderClan leader, the lanky tom had stepped into the clearing along with the rest of his clanmates, looking up at Laurelstar who stood upon the Highledge. He glanced around the clearing, his stomach was doing flips already. Today was the day, wasn’t it? He didn’t even get to groom his fur a bit, he’d look a little unkempt for the ceremony. Coyotepaw gulped nervously, his paws shuffling beneath him as he awaited the next words to be uttered— looking around to see if anyone he knew was here.

<u>ThunderClan Apprentice</u>

At Laurelstar’s summons, Wrenpaw was quick to slither from the apprentices den where had spent most of her morning fretting about her pelt and anxiously awaiting the ceremony. It wasn’t unusual for the cream furred molly to be a bundle of nerves, but today was unlike anything she had felt in quite some time. The day had finally come for her to receive her warrior name, and despite how much she’d tried to prepare, she still felt as though she wasn’t ready. 

She hurried to Coyotepaw’s side, noticing quickly that he looked just as anxious as her. She gave him a wide grin, smiling past her worries and almost forgetting them for several moments. She remembered when they had become apprentices together, and discussed becoming warriors together as well. She never thought it would actually happen, but alas, here they were about to walk into the next step of their lives together. A small purr rumbled in her throat. It had been nice to always have a friend at her side. <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

With great excitement and enthusiasm, Raccoonpaw darted for the Highledge the moment he heard the call of their leader. Ever since his own apprentice ceremony, he had developed a great enjoyment for the occasion and always wanted to be present to show support for his new clanmates. 

The ring-tailed tom happily sat then turned his bright gaze up to Laurelstar, giving her his full attention as he waited for her to speak again.</span>

</div></div>
Apprehension tickled at Marigolddust’s chest as he looked up at Laurelstar’s from the crowd below her ledge.  He wasn’t sure he was ready to not be a mentor anymore, and he wasn’t sure if he was ready to stop addressing Wrenpaw with the name he was used to, but with the warrior name she would earn today.  What would it be like, not to mentor her anymore?  How different would it be?  He remembered how nervous he had been when he had first become the honey furred fem’s mentor, and now he wasn’t sure if he was ready <em>not</em> to be.  He didn’t doubt that Wrenpaw was ready- he had made sure to explain just how ready he knew she was skill wise.  But she could tell that she was nervous now, and, placed next to her for the moments before she would step forwards, he brushed his tail softly against hers and gave her a smile in the hopes to reassure her a little, before focusing again on Laurelstar.  He didn’t want to take all of the attention from her and Coyotepaw today.  They reminded him a bit of himself and Fernpaw, although the two had only been able to share their apprentice ceremony, as her becoming the medicine cat apprentice had gotten in the way of their warrior ceremony.  He was happy to see that Coyote and Wren could share this ceremony with each other, though.  He didn’t doubt that Coyote had and would serve as a good friend to be by Wrenpaw’s side.  She’d be alright without Marigolddust teaching her, he was sure, although he did have a feeling it would be a bit lonely, not visiting and being around her every day.</span>

Once the majority of her clanmates had settled themselves beneath the Highledge, Laurelstar parted her maw to continue on with the ceremony. No time like the present, she supposed, time to nip these apprentices’ nerves in the bud. Get the hard part over with. <strong>”Today, I have gathered you all here to bear witness to the promotion of two of our own apprentices, for they are ready to become full-fledged warriors.”</strong> her heterochromatic gaze bore down into the frames of Coyotepaw and Wrenpaw, the ones in question. She took a deep breath, she wasn’t afraid to address a crowd— she was actually quite happy for these two cats. A smile was evident on her scarred features, even from where she stood all the way up on top of the ledge, overlooking the abandoned quarry where they made their home. <strong>”Coyotepaw and Wrenpaw, please step forward.”</strong> she gestured for them to approach the center of the clearing, where the space was cleared out by those congregating in the midst of it, allowing them passage through. It was time.

 <strong>”I, Laurelstar, leader of ThunderClan, call upon my warrior ancestors to look down on these two apprentices. They have trained hard to understand the ways of your noble code, and I commend them to you as  warriors in turn.”</strong>

Those same words which have been uttered for generation after generation, familiar to the ears of any warrior, were finally being conferred to these two apprentices. She was granting them their warrior names, and this marked a monumental occasion in their lives. A moment to be proud of. <strong>”Coyotepaw and Wrenpaw, do you promise to uphold the Warrior Code and to protect and defend your clan, even at the cost of your own life?”</strong>

Their answers would determine it all, and she waited for their acceptance as she kept her gaze trained on the both of them.

He was right, <em>it was today.</em> He took a deep breath to steel himself before he stepped forward, feeling a wave of relief wash over him as he spotted Wrenpaw appear at his side, she was also being promoted today. That brought a sense of comfort to the young tom, and he flashed her a small smile out of reassurance. They could do this, this was just a ceremony, the same old song and dance for everyone in the clan. They could easily handle this, they fought cats from the Dark Forest, they fought traitors, they helped save their clan.

<em>This is child’s play.</em>

At the command to step forward, the long-limbed tom looked up at the russet-furred tortoiseshell above them, listening closely to her words. <em>Do you promise to uphold the Warrior Code?</em> 

There was really only one answer, the only correct answer for a <em>warrior</em> of any clan to say.

<strong>”I do.”</strong>

He felt his anxieties wash away.</span>

<u>ThunderClan Apprentice</u>

As Marigolddust’s tail brushed over her, her amber optics met his and for several moments she stared at him, sadness lingering in her gaze. After today he would no longer be her mentor. They wouldn’t spend their days in the territory together anymore, learning, laughing, or teasing one another. Would they still be close? No, no, of course they would. Wrenpaw knew better than to worry about that. She touched her nose briefly to his cheek. <strong>”Thank you for everything,”</strong> she whispered softly before turning back to face Laurelstar. 

With Marigolddust there and Coyotepaw at her side, it wasn’t long before she felt all of her anxiety and fear ebbing away. This wasn’t a moment to fear. This was a moment to celebrate, a moment that every cat within every clan spent the early parts of their lives looking forward to. Wrenpaw’s eyes grew misty for a moment, though she worked hard to hide that from those around her. She felt as though she was feeling every single emotion at once right now, and it threatened to steal the air from her lungs. 

<em>I do.</em> Coyotepaw’s words echoed in her ears. He sounded confident, so sure of himself. This made Wrenpaw feel stronger. This was <em>their</em> moment. 

She stood up a little straighter and lifted her head a little higher, her voice ringing with conviction when she spoke. <strong>”I do.”</strong> <span class="mention" title="agatedemon#5698">@prim</span></span>

Their words of acceptance rang true in her ears and she flashed them a gracious smile, nodding in acknowledgement of their answers. Clearing her throat once again, the ThunderClan leader announced at last: <strong>”Then by the powers of StarClan, I give you your warrior names. Coyotepaw, from this moment on you will be known as Coyotestep. Wrenpaw, from this moment on you will be known as Wrenfrost. StarClan honors your courtesy and intelligence, and your courage and determination respectively, and we welcome you as full warriors of ThunderClan.”</strong> she conferred the new names and titles for the two youngest warriors of their clan with pride, her eyes gleaming as she addressed them formally. They had made it, their hard work had paid off. She led the chants of their new warrior names with exuberance, celebrating their accomplishments and contributions to the clan that had made this moment possible. They deserved all the fanfare possible, this was one of the most important moments in any warrior’s life!

<strong>”Coyotestep! Wrenfrost! Coyotestep! Wrenfrost! Coyotestep! Wrenfrost!”</strong>

A small purr emitted from his throat at the soft nudge from his apprentice- <em>ex-</em> apprentice.  <em><strong><em>”Of course,”</em></strong></em> he replied, his voice soft as he spoke.  He would miss teaching Wrenpaw and taking her out into the territories, and, in a way, her becoming a warrior was the last step in him becoming the full fledged medicine cat.  Without having a warrior apprentice to worry about, he would be left only with his medicine cat duties, fully teking on the role rather than part-time like he had over the past few moons.  He wasn’t sure how prepared he felt for it, but he assumed that it would be a lot less work.  Unfortunately, it also meant that he would have more time to think, and to remember everything that he had had as a warrior.  An amazing apprentice, normal duties, and close friends.  He didn’t mind being medicine cat, of course, and was happy to take the role.  But he couldn’t help but wish that Fernpaw and Rooksnap were still around to see him here, or even still around in general, even if it meant he would have remained a warrior.  

                  Then, it had become time for the two apprentices to become warriors.  Marigolddust listened intently, interested, excited, and perhaps only a bit sad.  He knew that he and Wrenpaw would still remain close, but he had never been a very big fan of change.  <em>Wrenfrost.</em>  The name tasted sweet on his tongue, even before he started to chant it and Coyotepaw’s new name, Coyotestep.  Both of the new titles felt perfect, albeit a bit different than he was used to.  The steady rhythm of the clan’s cheering for the two continued even when his thoughts wandered to both of the cats’ futures and what they might hold for them.  He know that his own wouldn’t include mentoring again for a long time, and he would never teach a cat to primarily do warrior duties again.</span>

No, the next time he would be appointed an apprentice would be on Starclan’s word, and they’d work side by side with him to keep the clan healthy.  Truthfully, he couldn’t help but wish that he could stick to being Wrenpaw’s mentor instead.</span>

A gentle multicolored gaze rested upon the tom, who licked bits of prey from his maw carefully. Palelilly took another bite of her own meal, plush audits flickering as the tom answered her greeting. The bashful femme turned her gaze away at the compliment, tail flickering. &quot;Thank you- Flickerfox, is it?&quot; She questioned, whiskers twitching as she returned to her breakfast. 

A kind smile spread across her face. &quot;I&#39;m doing well today, however I&#39;m quite bored. It&#39;s hard to find much to do with all this snow.&quot; She complained. Palelilly had always carried a disdain for leaf-bare and the cold seasons. She&#39;d much rather be warm. A chilling breeze rustled her fur, causing her to shuffle her stance. 

Palelilly finished her meal rather quickly, pushing the feathers into the snow as a temporary solution. Her bulbous tail flickered before curling over her paws, protecting her delicate toes from the wind chill. Her gaze refocused on the tom seated next to her, awaiting the next comfortable banter he&#39;d provide. Palelilly loved keeping company with members of the clan simply because of the familiarity. Every conversation was similar, no matter who you spoke to. Not one cat was significantly different from another. 

&quot;How&#39;ve you been lately, Flickerfox?&quot; She finally questioned, audits swiveling. <span class="mention" title="wild#9017">@wild™</span></span>

A shy smile adorned the feline’s face as she listened to his response, glad he wasn’t upset at her for disturbing his rest though she still felt bad about it. Her body relaxed as their conversation continued, enjoying the sound of his laughter as they joked back and forth with one another. <strong>”Oh I’m sure you do, though it might not be much to look at.”</strong> She teased, eyes sparkling with mischief. It wasn’t long ago when she would have been so nervous to playfully joke with a tom, but Cardinalspark made her feel so much at ease whenever they spent time together.

<strong>”You were? Well it is the thought that counts, Cardinalspark. I do appreciate that.”</strong> Honeydrop purred in response to his comment, knowing how hard it could be to try and find prey at times during the cold season, but she was still touched by him thinking of her. She found it cute as he apologized for rambling on a little bit about the food, blushing a little while he continued to speak caring things towards her. Ah yes, catching a cold. She remembered the last time that happened to her. It hadn’t been life threatening or anything of the sorts, but still miserable, nonetheless. She had overdone it trying to help everywhere she could, while remaining soaked from the rain and chilled to the bone with her short fur. It was then when the russet tom would check in on her, bringing her fresh-kill or keeping her warm while she recovered. Despite being sick, it was one of her favorite memories. <strong>”I saw once the warm season comes, we should head to the stream like old times.”</strong> The creamy she-cat suggested with a grin, thinking back to the times they would stop by the stream after hunting and spend some time lounging about or even going for a quick swim.

The admiration in which Laurelstar spoke about her father was clear. Iceheart’s ears pricked at every word, listening intently. It was confusing when the ginger-and-white femme talked about her relationship with Featherpelt. Iceheart must have done something incredible to be chosen as deputy over the tom. It seemed like they were still good friends over it too but unfortunately, she couldn’t remember. She knew she had been <em>there</em> during it but no memories came into mind. It frustrated her. 

 <strong>” He sounds like a wonderful warrior,”</strong> the lynx-point spoke softly, fur brushing against the bare thorn tunnel of the camp entrance. <strong>” Do you know how many siblings you have?”</strong> Iceheart questioned, forcing her bubbling anger away. Clearly, not only was Featherpelt a dedicated warrior but a committed father as well. Raising kits was not easy. Not that Iceheart knew anymore but she had a vague idea on how taxing it must be to juggle two different, time and energy consuming roles.

Her respect for her father was evident in every word she spoke, in truth he was almost universally liked by anyone he encountered. He could be a voice of reason, he had friends from all walks of life and was a cherished member of the clans. A truly peaceful, gentle cat who could calm down almost anyone he encountered. Practically a saint in her eyes, a cat she never could become, but could honor and try to uphold the legacy of. <strong>”There’s a lot, I don’t think I can count them all.”</strong> she let out an awkward chuckle at the question, her gaze lighting up for a moment. Her father practically took in any kit in need of a family, and gave them love and made them feel welcome in the clan’s walls. She wanted to do the same for her own kits, having taken on the same habit for a little while. Though since she had adopted that entire litter she found with Hollyfrost out in their abandoned Twoleg den out in the woods, she hadn’t taken in any since. She didn’t know if she could without her again, it was still so fresh in her mind, even if a couple moons had passed already. Not a day passed where she didn’t think of her.

<em>And our kits are growing older and older, and she can’t witness them becoming warriors.</em>

A sigh escaped her lips as her gaze grew wistful and cloudy for a moment, a pang of grief echoed within her heart for a moment. So many cats she loved were no longer with them, cats she and Iceheart both knew so well, and grief always seemed to know how to rear its ugly head back into these conversations. <strong>”He was one of the best, I know he’s looking out for us from wherever he is now.”</strong>

The sun was ever present in the sky as it overlooked the camp below. Shining its rays down upon the sand-colored rocks, the camp was basked in golden light. It was later on in the day, but the camp was ever busy, with familiar faces hustling and bustling down in the clearing. The ThunderClan leader had lost track of time when she realized she was to conduct a ceremony today, for one cat in particular. Figuring now was a better time than never, the tortoiseshell stepped out upon the Highledge, gazing down as her clanmates as she rallied them together with a call.

<strong>”Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey gather beneath the Highledge for a clan meeting!”</strong>

The call was made, and she awaited her clanmates to gather in the clearing down below. She watched with interest, waiting for the cats she’d be calling upon for this ceremony.

       Though so high in the sky, it felt like it scanned his entire body; the heat of the sun mercilessly lit his physique in a fairly comfortable state of warmth, though there was definitely a limit to such things. It was odd how such warmth was only achieved in leafbare however it was nothing to worry his mind too much about.
    Pacing to the clearing, he abide by Laurels announcement and gathered. The virile eventually found a spot, rooting his odd coloured manus to the ground and sat, to further listen in on what information this meeting had in store to share.</span>

             The leader&#39;s yowl rang across the camp. Tigerstripe emerged from the mossy den. His fur shone as he moved towards Highledge. The tabby smiled at the much younger Sandkit. He knew why the clan meeting was being called, to apprentice the kit. His heart pounded knowing that he could be chosen to mentor Sandkit. &quot; She could be my first apprentice!&quot; The unlikely possibility danced across his mind. He tried to conceal the obvious expression, knowing if he wasn&#39;t chosen, he would be devastated.</span>

Sandkit heard her leader’s call and hopped over to the center of the camp, her green eyes ⏃ gleam. Her paws were restless beneath her as she waited, and she wanted to squeal with excitement. <em>’ oh please let this be it, please let this be it ‘</em> she pleaded silently, eyes darting from one side of the camp to the next while cats began to gather in the clearing.</span>

As the growing crowd of cats appeared down below, gazing up at her upon her perch, the tortoiseshell leader had dipped her head to greet them all. Her heterochromatic gaze swept across the clearing for Sandkit, the one she was to promote today. This was a milestone for any clan cat, the day they reached six moons of age meant they were to be promoted to that of an apprentice. This was momentous indeed. So many cats were being promoted this moon, it was a good sign indeed. <strong>”Today I have gathered you all here to bear witness to the promotion of one of our own.”</strong> her gaze stopped at the sight of the young she-kit who was watching her with those bright green eyes of hers. <strong>”Sandkit, please step forward.”</strong>

She gestured for the kit to enter the clearing ahead of the Highledge with a swish of her tail. She was smiling gently, hoping to ease the kit’s nerves as the clan watched her from the sidelines. <strong>”Sandkit, you have reached the age of six moons, and it is time for you to be apprenticed. From this day on, until you receive your warrior name, you will be known as Sandpaw. Your mentor will be Tigerstripe. I hope Tigerstripe will pass down all he knows on to you.”</strong> her gaze then turned to the tom she had appointed as Sandpaw’s new mentor, her gaze stern as she expected him to keep her safe and train her well. <strong>”Tigerstripe, you are ready to take on an apprentice. You have received excellent training from Flickereye, and you have shown yourself to be trustworthy and a swift hunter. You will be the mentor of Sandpaw, and I expect you to pass on all you know to Sandpaw.”</strong> she then took a step back, allowing the pair to greet one another and accept each other as mentor and apprentice. As well as to allow the clan to celebrate their brand new apprentice amongst their ranks. Chanting of Sandpaw’s new name could be heard, including from the leader herself. 

<strong>”Sandpaw! Sandpaw! Sandpaw!”</strong>

With that being said, her work here was finished.

<strong>”This meeting is dismissed.”</strong>

As soon ⏃ Laurelstar said her name she knew it was her moment. She stood up and stepped forward, trying to settle herself so she wasn’t so fidgety. As her leader was speaking she felt ⏃ wide smile slowly spreading across her face. She looked over at Tigerstripe, and the smile fully took hold, she bounced over to the Tom, looking up at him with the most joyous look in all of the clans. Her clan mates were cheering her name, and she couldn’t help but burst with pride that she was finally an apprentice, <em>’ Sandpaw…Sandpaw! ⟟ can’t believe it! ‘</em>. <strong>”you’re gonna be my mentor?!”</strong> she said excitedly with her still squeak-ish-kit-ish voice.

The clan never ceased the cheering &quot;SANDPAW!SANDPAW!&quot; The loudest yowl was her mother, Blurryyowl. A little excited mew rang in his ear. ”<strong>**</strong>you’re gonna be my mentor**?!&quot;                                                                          He couldn&#39;t contain his excitement and happily responded:&quot; Umm...

She smiled at that. <strong>” Hopefully you can name them all!”</strong> Iceheart exclaimed, sea-green eyes glinting with amusement. It didn’t last long, especially with Laurelblaze’s mourning expression. <strong>” I think he’s in StarClan. Why wouldn’t he be? He seemed like an amazing Clanmate.”</strong> At least, that’s what she has been told in the past moons: good cats go to StarClan. Bad ones go to the Dark Forest and some with unfinished business, roam the lands as spirits. 

Iceheart glanced back at the camp from the top of the stone hollow, admiring its beauty. The rocks glistened with early morning frost and the snow was still thickly blanketed over every surface possible. An innate feeling arose within her chest: to fiercely protect everything contained within the quarry. <em>Is this how a ThunderClan warrior is supposed to feel or did this come from somewhere else?</em>

Their stubborn tempers - one fiery, one stone cold - didn&#39;t mix, and the warrior&#39;s blunt criticisms hardly went over well. She hadn&#39;t spoken to him since, and he&#39;d rarely seen her, but he didn&#39;t go chasing her. If she wanted to sit on her training, that was her will.

Finishing his grooming with a last couple of licks, Wolfprowl prepared to set off for an assigned patrol. He was just about to file out of camp with the rest of the group when... <span class="mention" title="&#127754;EDDY&#127754;#2473">@Skeptical Moxxy™</span></span>

<em>&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot;</em>

The vibrant calico emerged bristling and proceeded across Thunderclan&#39;s clearing in several long stride, thrusting herself into Wolfprowl&#39;s path. Bright occulars narrowed, glaring daggers into Thunderclan&#39;s easily most apathetic warrior and her mentor. It&#39;d been several quart moons, newleaf on their tails as the last snowpacks were melting, and the grey masculine hadn&#39;t bothered even poking his nose into the apprentices&#39; den. If it hadn&#39;t been for following her compatriots by example she&#39;d not even know a proper hunting crouch and caught her first measly mouse several sunrises past. Scarletpaw yearned to reach out and shove the warriors chest of claw off an ear but she lingered stone still. 

<em>&quot;You&#39;re a real</em> <em><strong>dung</strong></em> <em>mentor, Wolfprowl. I&#39;ve half a mind to go to Laurelstar.&quot;</em></span>

The joke coming from the lynx-point about her memorizing her family’s names caused her whiskers to twitch out of amusement. <strong>”Believe me, once the number of kits your father takes in exceeds ten, its going to be hard to memorize their names. A while back I had to ask kits if my father was raising them or not, it got confusing.”</strong> she wasn’t even lying, her father’s habit of picking up new offspring to raise was quite the feat, but it made figuring out who she was related to confusing. Though it was nowhere near as perplexing as it was back then, most were grown by now, handling their own affairs. Some didn’t stay with the clan, either. 

<strong>”He has a good heart. I know he’s looking out for everyone.”</strong> her bi-colored gaze drifted back to the paler she-cat, a faint smile adorning her lips as she watched the she-cat inspect the camp walls. <strong>”Something the matter?”</strong> she tilted her head slightly, her tone changing to that of a more concerned one. Laurelstar needed to know if everything was all right, if there was anything amiss that needed to be dealt with. Did she see something wrong? Her throat constricted as she glanced around, she was getting ready to go on the defense if needed. She was always a bit of a jumpy type, trigger happy with her claws. <strong>”Iceheart?”</strong>

The pointed tom-cat turned pale optics toward the opposing feline, dipping his head a tad at her words, whiskers quivering slightly at her inquiry. <strong>&quot;Indeed, it is I.&quot;</strong> he rasped in response, fluffy tail swaying about behind him as the warrior returned to gaze at his own meal, as if making sure it hadn&#39;t somehow come alive again and ran off while his attention was directed elsewhere. He was pleased to note that the prey still laid before him, generally untouched.
    His ears flicked as the opposing warrior spoke about her day so far - claiming to be particularly bored this morning. Boredom wasn&#39;t an unfamiliar concept to the pointed tom-cat - it was easy for him to lose interest in something, regardless of if it was alive or not. He was ever the curious fellow who drank up knowledge like a thirsty soul does with water, he was typically parched for such. At the same time, he was such a quick learner he often found himself satisfied with what he gained far too quickly, or that which he received knowledge from would leave him far too soon. Occasionally, he&#39;d busy his mind with various thoughts concerning whatever had captured his interest beforehand, of all the possibilities it could hold - though even that would grow boring with time and he&#39;d be forced to find something else to wrap his mind around. This had led to quite the sticky situation more than once, though Flickerfox hadn&#39;t changed his ways even so.</span>

    <strong>&quot;I suppose I&#39;m alright. Alive and soon to have a full belly, they say that&#39;s living.&quot;</strong> he replied, swiping his tongue over his maw. <strong>&quot;I must admit, today is going pretty slowly...you say there&#39;s nothing much you can do, though I see a number of things one could invest their time into. At the same time, I know others lack interest in various areas, unlike myself...so what may interest me, could easily turn away another.&quot;</strong>

At that, he turned to his prey - which was merely a pile of bones, feathers among other things. He broke off a bone, before snapping it in two. <strong>&quot;Like say, bones. Bones are fascinating. They come in various shapes, sizes and weights even. Though oftentimes, they&#39;re all that&#39;s left of the carcass. No one else finds any interest in dining on them, yet they could serve as...multiple things.&quot;</strong> The tom continued, before putting the remains of his meal in a small pile.

The russet warrior turned to glance at the cream-furred warrior next to him, ears lowering as he placed a paw upon his chest. <strong>&quot;Not much to look at? Ah! I know it&#39;s been hindered by a few scars here and there, but I do believe I still have decent looks that rival those around me.&quot;</strong> He replied in a mockingly hurt tone, before a sly smile appeared on his face. <strong>&quot;And besides, I&#39;ve got character.&quot;</strong> he added, with a wink.
    Cardinalspark had always been an easygoing, charismatic character who was easy to get along with so long as one&#39;s persona didn&#39;t clash too harshly with his. At times, such would happen as the russet warrior wasn&#39;t always the most serious feline in the clan. He was often playful and even immature at times, though one could count on the feline during times of need all the same. He was a prideful feline who was rooted to his clan, though wasn&#39;t one who&#39;d be subjected to stereotypes nor classical images.
    The feline was pleased to know that Honeydrop hadn&#39;t been upset over the fact that he wasn&#39;t able to bring her some prey. She was understanding as usual, which was one of the reasons why he liked her - he didn&#39;t have to worry about being a certain way around her or worrying over the fact that his actions - or lack thereof - could upset her. Of course, he still did worry from time to time, most likely due to the bond he&#39;d developed between himself and her, though it wasn&#39;t like the times during his youth where certain things were expected of him or certain actions were despised. He could simply be himself.

At her words about the stream, the tom purred. <strong>&quot;That would be ideal. We could go in celebration of new-leaf...so long as it&#39;s not too chilly. In any case, I&#39;d love to go again sometime soon...which wouldn&#39;t be long. We haven&#39;t done anything like that for quite some time...&quot;</strong> he mused, with a quiet breath escaping him.

        Lounging was a luxury this deputy took for granted as a warrior. Some things a mortal takes for granted and realizes its value once its no longer within reach. <em>We always want what we cant have.</em> Everything falls into this trap. Young and old.
    With a yawn, the peculiarly pigmented tom found himself stretching his physique and letting it set down on the uneven terrain of Thunderclan camp. It was an early morning, and as much as he failed to be a natural early bird, the narcoleptic bachelor found himself growing fond of the serenity such an hour of time brought to the territory. Everyone was still sleeping. It was an hour that was not often disturbed. If a time of day had to be disturbed, people often chose nighttime. But early morning was always silent. It was almost improper to think; the usual bustling campsite now emptied out. Like some fever dream rather. But it couldnt have been a fever dream when he clearly felt the sun embrace his figure in the occassional moments when the clouds in the firmament did not occupy its radiance. The snow clearly melted away from beneath this endothermic gladiator. This was no fever dream. Nor did he wish it. It was his temporary Nirvana.</span>

A soft giggle escaped the feline’s lips as she listened to his dramatic display of pain. <strong>”I never realized you were such a great actor.”</strong> She mused with a smile, though with his type of personality it wasn’t surprising to see that he was a tom of many talents. <strong>”Maybe you’re not so bad after all.”</strong> Her tone was teasing as she playfully nudged his shoulder, fully relaxed beside him as they conversed back and forth. She had definitely missed their conversations, but clan life could be pretty busy at times, especially in the cold weather when everyone was hunting extra to try and fill in the lack of prey.

<strong>”In celebration of new-leaf? That sounds like a good idea, plus it would give us a chance to be alone.”</strong> Honeydrop said with a teasing glint in her eyes, before placing a quick lick to his cheek. <strong>”I’ve missed our small talks. They were always quite entertaining.”</strong> She stated softly, thinking back to their times spent together. It had been a while since they had first started hanging out so much, and she could only assume that maybe…their feelings towards each other were the same. Though, of course she could be reading the whole situation entirely wrong between them, and if that was the case, what was he thinking of her right now for licking his cheek? If he didn’t feel the same way towards her, she only hoped that he took it as a friendly lick from one friend to another. They were close enough for that, right? Her cheeks became a little bit rosy as she began to overthink her actions, and ducked her head down shyly in hopes he didn’t notice the heat filling her face.

</div></div>  The large brown tabby Tom moved into the camp clearing for that darkness of the apprentices den that he had been hunkered down in. His large paws crunched against the semi frozen ground, lavender gaze looked across the camp clearing, before moving his way to the fresh kill pile. He had hunted much earlier that morning and it would be time for dinner by now, and he could probably just nibble at a mouse. He picked out a medium sized one from the few he could see amongst the other discarded carcasses, tugging it away from the body heap by the tail.
  He turned and headed off to the side of camp, plopping onto his rear before flopping all the day to his side. Dropping the prey between his front paws, his claws unsheathed, moving to slice apart then mouse for easier consumption.

With the changing of the seasons, it was evident that her clanmates were emerging from that lulled state leaf-bare brought with it. The snow was mostly melted, though some patches did remain in spots littered around camp. Laurelstar could even see clumps of her winter coat beginning to shed from her frame, thinning out as warmer weather came. Almost as if a switch flipped and it told her dense fur to beat it. Alas, her coveted cold weather was to leave them, and she would be a very cranky, long-furred feline during the warmer weather.

The gigantic tortoiseshell had emerged from her den upon the Highledge, doing her daily once-over of her camp below, inspecting the state of affairs of her subjects and their home. She did not treat them like <em>subjects</em> per se, but they did look up to her for guidance. She was their leader. It was her job to ensure they remained safe. Things were to her liking, everyone was engaged in typical activity for this time of day. Some were coming in from early-morning hunts, others arising from their slumber. She couldn’t help but to be pleased, everything was well. It had been a long time since she could truly rest easy after tending to her clan. It was… Freeing, knowing she didn’t have any enemies looking to rip into them all.

She could breathe again.

The sovereign descended from her perch, down into the quarry below. She carefully padded down the boulders that made up the staircase that led up to her den. She then entered the camp, shaking out her coat that sent red and ginger-colored hair strands flying into the air. She would look a little raggedy for the next while she assumed. Her clanmates were used to this already, she was positive of that. Speaking of clanmates, she could see one digging into a meal already— an apprentice. <strong>”Good day to you, Ratpaw.”</strong> she flashed the young tom a polite smile, her bushy tail swaying. She didn’t want to startle him all of a sudden, getting his attention before sparking a conversation was the safest bet to go with.

</div></div>  Ratpaw had sliced up slivers of half the mouse by time the leader had approached him, and he lets out a soft clearing of his throat, moving to sit up from his flopped over position, dipping his head respectfully after shaking the dust and ground particles from his fur. The toms extended long claws returned to their sheathes, and he looked down at his half-ready meal, before turning her attention back up towards the leader.
  “<strong>Heyya, Laurelstar!</strong>” he greeted and then looked towards the sky to try and decipher the time, though it was more of a glance because his attention was back on the leader in a second. “<strong>How are you doing today?</strong>” he asked, tilting his head ever so slightly as his brown ears perked.

Relief filled her senses as she didn’t seem to catch the younger cat off-guard all of a sudden. She didn’t intend to cause fright. Her sheer size and imposing presence sometimes could startle unsuspecting bystanders if she approached them while they weren’t paying attention. It had happened more times than she could count in her lifetime, which is surprising to her because she wasn’t exactly <em>trying</em> to sneak up on anyone. She wasn’t the stealthy sort at all.

She dipped her head to the tom to acknowledge his returned greeting, settling herself down a couple feet away from him as she answered his inquiry. <strong>”I’m doing well today, trying to get some duties done early so I can enjoy the warmer weather now that leaf-bare is finally ending.”</strong> even she had to admit she did like seeing the sun more, and not having days end early because it decided to set at earlier times. It was getting brighter and brighter out, getting them to focus more easily. Everyone would be in a better mood, though when a fruitful season rolled around, it could also bring increased tensions from clans seeking to take more territory they could use. She would alert Alerceclaw to tell the patrols he sends out to be on high alert. They couldn’t afford to lose warriors now, even if they were slowly replenishing their ranks with new promotions. They needed experienced cats available to defend the clan if necessary. <strong>”More prey is coming out now that the thaw is occurring, though we will have to watch out for predators as well. Be careful whenever you’re out in the territory while training.”</strong> she was only speaking out of concern, the youth of her clan deserved to train in peace, without worrying about getting in harm’s way. Though she knew that was an impossible dream, they weren’t called <em>war</em>riors for nothing.

Excited giggles filled the camp as a certain bubbly feline bounded out of the apprentices den, bright and early as today was a very important day for him. He had been looking forward to today all night, hardly getting any sleep because of it. Raccoonpaw has found that clan life was perfect for him so far. He loved that the clan helped and took care for one another, something he was not used to thanks to his careless Twoleg owners. It made him realize that he now had a family, but he had to do his part as well. So every chance he had to learn and train to become a Warrior was something he cherished. Sure, he didn&#39;t really know anyone besides Laurelstar, but he was determined to change that. Soon he would provide for the clan and show that he was a true clan cat.

<strong>&quot;Laurelstar!&quot;</strong> The young tom called out cheerfully, perhaps a little too loud for such an early morning. He stopped outside of her den, standing tall with a wide grin as he called out once again. <strong>&quot;Lauralstar, I&#39;m ready for training!&quot;</strong> He took a step back, now bouncing excitedly on his paws as he waited for an answer from the molly inside.

</div></div>  The tall and lean tabby feline nodded as he listened to her. “<strong>Yeah, I did the same,</strong>” he said softly, but that wasn’t to say he didn’t have intentions to go back out later for a evening hunt if the opportunities came up. As the leader continued on and warned him to be careful, he nodded, “<strong>Yes Ma’am,</strong>” he chimed in softly, before glancing back to his mouse, before nosing what was still left on the bone and not sliced up towards her. 
  “<strong>Here- would you like to share?</strong>” he asked as he raised his head back up, licking the smudge of blood from his nose that was left from the small prey. He gave her a polite and warm smile, though he was a bit surprised that the leader had decided on him over all of the other clanmates she could have spoken to, as the two never really held a conversation more than a few words  at a time.

She always had a soft-spot for those seeking refuge within her clan. It was s tradition ThunderClan had held up since ancient times, welcoming in outsiders who sought to join their clan. Much of her family consisted of cats who had been brought into the clan from the outside, she cared for them, she wanted her clan to be a safe haven for all. They would be cared for and protected under her rule. She wanted to be a benevolent leader, one who defended the helpless and inspired courage from her clanmates. It was also why she took a certain apprentice under her wing, so she could make sure his enthusiasm and zeal for training wouldn’t cause him any harm. Everything was good in moderation.

<strong>”I’m here, Raccoonpaw.”</strong> the lichen curtain hanging outside of her den’s entrance parted ways as she stepped out, staring down at the younger tom with a gentle smile. It was rare for an apprentice to go seeking out their mentor, but Raccoonpaw was just so eager, so on top of it that he went out of his way to seek her out. She admired his work ethic, in a way, it reminded her of herself at his age. So bright, so willing to train, wanting to grow stronger— so na&#239;ve to the world. The harsh realities of it hadn’t fully settled in for him just yet. She didn’t want him to go through half the amount of trauma she had endured in her years alive, he didn’t deserve to ever suffer. <strong>”We’ll get going, come on.”</strong> she nodded to her apprentice, tail swishing as she looked up to the golden skies of dawn for just a moment. It was getting warmer out now that the sun was rising, but the remnants of leaf-bare’s chilly winds were still present. It was exiting, but it was taking its sweet time. She couldn’t wait for the mornings to be pleasantly warm when she woke up at the crack of dawn. It’d make training much more bearable for all of her pupils. Plus she could spend time at the lake more often and wade in the water a bit, she actually enjoyed it, though she didn’t possess the proper skills to truly swim like a RiverClanner.

He seemed to be behaving rather formally around her, though it wasn’t exactly unexpected. Being the leader of her clan, and keeping their difference in age in mind, many of the younger cats of her clan didn’t exactly know how to address her. She could be an imposing figure towards them, they didn’t know her as well as the cats who were closer to her in age and in rank. She was well-known figure, but to say she was <em>well-known…</em>

Sometimes they were a little shy.

When he offered up part of his meal to her, she gently shook her head and politely declined. <strong>”You need it more than I do currently. I’m not hungry yet anyhow.”</strong> she dipped her skull to the tom, his generous offer was acknowledged, but she wanted to handle a bit more work before she sat down to eat. She would be fine for now anyways. Better he get his meal in before her anyways, he’d probably be training later on today.

</div></div>  Ratpaw nodded slowly, and hooked a claw into the mouses tail tugging it back next to the already sliced meat he had prepped for himself. He was rather neat, for a tom. His name, other than in pelt color alone, didn’t match him. He was large, not small, tabby printed, kind and generous. And had his mother been anyone else he might had been named something more fitting. This wasn’t the case, however, and day-to-day he strived to push past his name and shine above it. 
  “<strong>Well, you’ve gotta let me hunt dinner for you some time,</strong>” he offered politely with a warm smile, and before she could decline that, he cut in again. “<strong>And I’m not going to take no for an answer,</strong>” he said, raising a brow at her. He was a stubborn one, and even if she were to brush it off this time, he would leave her no choice another. Perhaps she had made a mistake when choosing him to speak to this afternoon.

The weather seemed to have become a little warmer the further the forest progressed into the season of New-Leaf, Leaf-Bare slowely fading away into the background like an awkward stage in a apprentice’s life.  Clumsily, it continued to slowely pass by, stooping between cold temperatures and temperatures that were warmer than what they had had throughout the previous moons.  Sometimes, Marigolddust could have sword he could see some green hints in the branches that lay like a blanket over the forest, hanging above his head like a unevenly built nest on dewy ground.  But, this only came with mere glances.  Whenever he tried to pay more focus to the areas in question, he found nothing besides the grey-brown of dead branches.  He had come to think he might have been imagining it all, his excitement for warmer seasons outrunning the reality of his situation.  The weather was still quite chilly, although it was becoming warmer and warmer every day, and snow still fell, although it had become more sparse and broken by small showers of rainfall.  

                    Even so, Marigolddust’s heart beat faster at the mere anticipation of New-Leaf taking away this horrid stage of Leaf-Bare.  Really, it hadn’t been all that bad, and nothing more than a few colds and scrapes from falls had sprung up because of it.  Even so, the medicine cat didn’t want to take chances.  The sooner this season was gone, the less likely a wave of green-cough or something similar might break out.  This was his first Leaf-Bare as the medicine cat of Thunderclan, and he had done fairly well thus far in the journey.  If sickness as bad as greencough broke out in Thunderclan, though, it might be a different story.  He had yet to cure a cat from greencough, since he had received no reason to do so, and therefor he was inexperienced; not to mention, he had only ever had one training session with another clan’s medicine cat.</span>

                  He would be having one with Otterpop soon, of course- they were still in the planning stage for Marigolddust to travel to Riverclan to train, but it was more progress than he had made for awhile.  Ruining the opportunity of being trained by Beanspark and Specklerose wasn’t the best course of action in benefitting his professionalism, considering the fact that, besides Otterpop, they were the only cats who could have taught him, but he had decided it had been out of his power.  He hadn’t known that the Dark Forest had plotted to attack them, nobody did.  Well, none thought that they would do so as early and with as much of a blow to the clan.  He, Iceheart, and Laurelstar- Icestar and Laurelblaze then- had been the only ones aware of it, along with the poor apprentices who had been thrown into the Dark Forest with the traitors, his previous apprentice included.  

                     Marigolddust grimaced, before giving his head a firm shake.  He didn’t like thinking back to the events, and he didn’t need his day to be ruined just because he was thinking back to something that couldn’t be prevented or changed.  He had no responsibility in it, although perhaps he should have checked on Wrenpaw more.  But she was Wrenfrost now, and she could watch out for herself perfectly fine.  She didn’t need him, not now that she was a full-grown warrior.  He was more proud of her than he thought he had ever men in anything or anyone before, besides the fact that certain instances with Fernpaw might have been a match.  Marigolddust released a small sigh, quickly sending his tongue over his whiskers as he tried to focus on the present.  It was a nice day, and everyone was walking around and enjoying the warmth of the day, overall, at least.</span>

                     He should have been out having a nice meal, maybe making conversation with a cat or two.  He was terrible at talking to others, but he wasn’t sure he would be able to handle the loneliness of his den for much longer.  So, he hoped that he might not feel quite so isolated today, although he couldn’t bring himself to approach anybody.  He was still too young and insecure to bring himself to do so, especially with cats he hardly knew, and he didn’t want to ruin someone’s day by acting particularly awkward or sheepish around them.  It would only make it worse if he started such conversations, wouldn’t it?  So, instead of acting upon his wishes, he sat there, tail curled around himself, doing little more than daydreaming himself approaching another cat with full confidence and starting a good conversation.  Starclan, he wished.

Her own namesake was rather fitting, being dubbed <em>Laurel</em> for her mottled tortoiseshell pelt. Her parents were caring, and they dubbed all of their children with kind names. While Ratpaw may not sound the most pleasant, it wasn’t the worst. Rats were clever creatures, and they worked together with the packs they lived in. In a way, they were loyal to one another, though she wouldn’t probably name her own kits after them. Ratpaw, however, didn’t really have much of a choice in the matter. Just like how she couldn’t have given herself a cooler name that sounded more threatening, though her enemies would quiver in fear after hearing her name anyhow. She was a well-known presence across the forest clans, she wasn’t to be trifled with.

<strong>”I mean, I can also just order you to not bring me food, as the leader of your clan, you know.”</strong> she grew stern for a moment, her gaze hardening. His insistence was kind, but she knew ways around the loophole. Her steely expression melted away into amusement, clearly she was just joking around with the tom. She didn’t mean to cause false panic for a moment, though she didn’t want to be fretted over by a <em>child</em> practically. She could take care of herself, she wasn’t ancient! <em>I’m thirty-two moons old damn it!</em> 

Perhaps he wasn’t aware of how stubborn the leader of ThunderClan was either. She was practically the most stubborn of them all! Just try her.

The sun had already risen over the horizon, casting its golden rays upon those whom dwelled below. The rays danced upon the morning dew, the remaining snow and ice that had begun to melt away, slowly but surely. It caused these things to sparkle, to glimmer, to shine - as if a promise for a brighter future sometime soon. The birds had begun to sing together once more, insects had returned to buzzing about in the annoying way they do and critters of all kinds had begun to return to the undergrowth, skittering about among the shadows. Yes, things were returning, slowly but surely. New-leaf was coming and he couldn&#39;t wait for it.
    At last, freedom from the harsh season of leaf-bare was on the horizon. Featherpaw couldn&#39;t say that this season had been particularly harsh or dreadful - when compared to the stories some warriors and elders spoke of of leaf-bares among the past, this one held little in comparison. And besides - since coming out of the war moons ago, Featherpaw would much rather deal with little prey and potential illness than traitors and scary cats who harmed his loved ones. The image of his mother&#39;s soul being taken from her body was still ingrained in his mind, as was the image of the lifeless Hollyfrost. In all honesty, he still hadn&#39;t gotten over that loss and frequently suffered from nightmares despite the war having been long over. Perhaps childish, but he couldn&#39;t help it all the same.</span>

    To make matters worse, he had a constant reminder of his troubles - his lame leg. He had earned it during the landslide and unfortunately, hadn&#39;t been able to assist his clanmates during combat, save for ushering a few kits to safety. He had hidden himself among the darkest corners of the camp to merely watch and quite frankly such actions were cowardly - he despised the day he ever did such. Though, it wasn&#39;t like he&#39;d be much help either way, but he&#39;d lost so many things that day - two cats that were quite important to him. Hollyfrost, his mother and Icestar, his mentor. Though Icestar - now Iceheart - was still alive, he&#39;d hardly spoken to her since that fateful day. Even training sessions had been rather slow, though uncomfortably silent. And he felt bad for doing so, but dealing with one who didn&#39;t remember you despite moons of training was...hard. So, he simply chose not to speak - otherwise, he&#39;d find himself questioning her all over again.

So, perhaps the Stars had been kind to them and allowed Thunderclan a relatively easy leaf-bare this time around. He certainly was grateful for it, whatever the reasoning behind it turned out to be. The black tabby allowed a sigh to escape him as he hobbled out of the apprentice den, blue-green optics flickering about the camp. His gaze landed upon Marigolddust, the clan&#39;s medicine cat. Perhaps he ought to spare him a word, it didn&#39;t seem like he was particularly busy at the moment. He decided it would probably be best to bring him something to eat - out of courtesy, of course. So, he limped his way over to the fresh-kill pile, selecting a squirrel before making his way over to the tuxedo tom.</span>

You look as if you&#39;ve been out here for some time, though aren&#39;t sure what to do.

Fortunately enough for Marigolddust, it turned out that he had gotten lucky today.  The chances of himself actually approaching another cat were very low, unless it was one of the cats who he considered close friends of his- which, unfortunately, amounted to quite a low number.  Although he felt that he was friends with most every one of his clanmates, considering he was the medicine cat, he never truly got the opportunity to become close with many of them.  Usually, a cat comes to his den looking to have some sort of pain they were holding relieved, and then once he does just that, they leave and never bother to visit again until they’re hurting once more.  Marigolddust couldn’t help but feel like he had done something wrong every time that a cat showed him kindness and then disappeared as soon as they’re impairments were fixed.  Perhaps they would come by more if he spoke more, or if he wasn’t so calm?  Maybe if he managed to catch them onto conversation after he was done healing them?  

                    But, no, that had never turned out to work very well.  His clanmates were simply too busy to give the medicine cat some of their time, and he understood.  Of course, he was being selfish looking for every cat who stopped by to come visit again- it was lonely, yes, but he couldn’t take up every cat’s time.  He could only be prepared for the next visitor to arrive, and then be ready to not see them again for awhile.  Was this what the life of a medicine cat was like?  Lonely, even when your den was occupied by a dozen other cats?  Marigolddust had primarily tensed at the sound of a voice next to him, his tail giving his body a squill squeeze before the startlement wore off, Marigolddust’s eyes landing on a tom who had approached him from the side opposite of where he had been looking.</span>

                    It was more than likely that he would have noticed the apprentice if he hadn’t been so observed in his own thoughts, but he tried not to make that so clear as he gave Featherpaw a smile and a respectful dip of his head; a gesture he offered cats perhaps a bit too much, considering it’s usual strength in it’s representation.  <em><strong><em>”Oh, hey, Featherpaw.  That’s for me?”</em></strong></em> he asked, yes landing on the morsel of prey the apprentice offered him.  A warm emotion budded in his chest at the idea of the tom sparing his time to give Marigolddust something he could have easily acquired by his own doing, as ironic to his previous thoughts as it was.  Featherpaw was one of the handful of cats who Marigolddust remembered the names to, and it was for good reason, too.  Featherpaw was a friendly and kind tom, from what Marigolddust had seen and experienced, and it was hard to forget the name of the cat who served as the processor of one of the most difficult injuries Marigolddust had had to heal in his growing time as Thunderclan’s Medicine cat.  

                        He had also proven to be one of the very few felines who Marigolddust couldn’t quite fix.  It was a miracle and a blessing sent from Starclan, the fact that he had managed to only be unsuccessful with very few patients despite his lack in training, but he felt absolutely terrible about it.  He could still recall when Featherpaw had earned the injury to his leg.  The limb had been crushed by a fallen boulder from the side of Thunderclan’s camp, and, on instinct, Marigolddust had come at the sound of Laurelblaze’s call and assisted her in removing the gigantic stone.  He hadn’t known what to expect to witness underneath, but he had gone forward without hesitation anyways, even though he didn’t doubt he would have been much more reluctant if he had known the mess of Featherpaw’s leg they would find underneath the wreckage.</span>

                        Marigolddust had tried his best, but despite his best efforts, he couldn’t repair the destroyed bone of the apprentice’s leg.  And, so, the tom still had the same limp today, and it never failed at making Marigolddust feel guilty.  But the tuxedo kept his eyes away from the lame leg for now, keeping eye contact with Featherpaw instead.  He had enough confidence to do so as of recent, which he was proud of, although he wasn’t sure how long his progress would go from taking one step forward to one step forward and two steps back.  Marigolddust adverted his gaze back to the prey and gave an embarrassed chuckle at Featherpaw’s observation.  <em><strong><em>”Well, that wouldn’t be completely inaccurate.  The first one, I mean- although I’m not too bad at staying still, either,”</em></strong></em> he said, his tone having a hint of playfulness to it.  He was uncertain whether his words were a joke or not, but he decided he’d let the young tom decide, rather than himself.  He wasn’t the most decisive of felines, anyhow.

</div></div>  The lean tall tabby chuckled and gave a simple shrug in response to her words. He didn’t seem too threatened by her words, besides he had his own come back working up. He flashed her a charming half grin, “<strong>You could.. but would you really not allow a young striving apprentice catch you a meal to show the progress in his training?</strong>” he asked, almost sounding offended towards the end, but with that half grin it was clear that he was also just joking. 
  “<strong>I mean,</strong> <em>I guess</em> <strong>I understand. Being the leaders an important job,</strong>” he began again, looking across the camp clearing briefly, before leaning away some. “<strong>Such important time should be bided to more pressing matters. No time to spend having fresh-caught dinner with an apprentice.</strong>”

<em>&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot;</em>

The vibrant calico emerged bristling and proceeded across Thunderclan&#39;s clearing in several long stride, thrusting herself into Wolfprowl&#39;s path. Bright occulars narrowed, glaring daggers into Thunderclan&#39;s easily most apathetic warrior and her mentor. It&#39;d been several quart moons, newleaf on their tails as the last snowpacks were melting, and the grey masculine hadn&#39;t bothered even poking his nose into the apprentices&#39; den. If it hadn&#39;t been for following her compatriots by example she&#39;d not even know a proper hunting crouch and caught her first measly mouse several sunrises past. Scarletpaw yearned to reach out and shove the warriors chest of claw off an ear but she lingered stone still. 

<em>&quot;You&#39;re a real</em> <em><strong>dung</strong></em> <em>mentor, Wolfprowl. I&#39;ve half a mind to go to Laurelstar.&quot;</em>                    </span>

For better or worse, the last thing Featherpaw was was overly observant - as a matter of fact, he hardly knew what was going on half the time. Lost among his own little world of fantastical realities or merely his own thoughts, it wasn&#39;t uncommon for him not to realize what was going on before him - let alone the smaller details others were able to pick up among others and their surroundings, leaving the poor tom-cat to figure things out by himself...which, typically led to him getting lost among his own mind once more. He wasn&#39;t exactly scatter-brained nor a true daydreamer - resting somewhere in the middle of both traits and quite honestly, his general lack of observance was merely to blame. He always meant well, but he wasn&#39;t the most attentive feline among Thunderclan.
    Though, after suffering the loss of Hollyfrost and partial loss of Icestar, the tok had tried his best to pay more attention to those around him. He wished he&#39;d done so during the time the beloved black molly was alive, as well as while his mentor still obtained all her memories - he felt as if he could know so much more about them, but now he&#39;d practically lost his chance at doing so and was now suffering in more ways than one. Though, he couldn&#39;t say such a lifestyle was easy - trying to focus on things was hard, especially when there was so much to watch and observe, it was difficult to pick just one thing. So, he decided he ought to pair what he wasn&#39;t good at with something he was good at - observing another while having a good ol&#39; chat. Surely, this was something he could handle.</span>

His ears merely twitched in response to the medic&#39;s words, his tail flicking about behind him. <strong>&quot;Is that so? What&#39;s up then? Can&#39;t decide on what to do first?

The tabby apprentice trailed off, offering the tom a kind smile. <strong>&quot;We should have a contest one day to see who can sit still longer then, cause I&#39;m pretty good at it too.&quot;</strong> His whiskers quivered a tad, blue-green eyes bright. <strong>&quot;Though, I must say sitting still for a <em>long</em> time can get pretty boring...you should try getting in on some action every now and then.

I&#39;ve never seen a medicine cat like that before - adventurous, daring and whatnot, y&#39;know?&quot;</strong> Featherpaw rambled onward, already seeming to drift off into his own thoughts once more.

Sparrowfeather poked her head out of the warriors den, ears flattened to her head. She perked up at the smell of Newleaf it brought the chirping of birds! And finally no snow! She stuck her head fully out of the den and- <strong>PUFF</strong> a wad of melting snow smacked down onto her head. She snorted- shaking her head and stepping away from the warriors den. Patting down her wet fur. She would go to the fresh-kill pile but she hadn’t gone on a hunting patrol yet… if she could just find Sandstride… maybe she already left. Sparrowfeather sat down across the freshkill pile, leaning against the walls of the camp. Pinefoot still wasn’t talking to her… they had fallen apart.. did he really not want to talk to her anymore? She sighed. Every time she looked for him he would just vanish. And they still had their crow: Clo. It’s still rather weird that a bird would take such a liking to a predator… 

Sparrowfeathers ears perked at the sound of footsteps. <em>Its Keenstreak!</em> she backed up behind a fern- hoping he wouldn’t approach her. Yet he did, his tail swinging behind him, his left eye was still blurry and scarred and his dark brown fur still looked matted from when Pinefoot scratched it up. <strong>”Sparrowfeather! How’s my favorite warrior doing?”</strong> 
Sparrowfeather chuckled nervously. <strong>”Fine…”</strong> she slowly started to edge away. Keenstreak put his paw out. 
<strong>”We haven’t hung out in awhile, huh? How about we go hunting. Just the two of us? Like old times- I mean they’re not that old..”</strong> he laughed and Sparrowfeather gave a half hearted smile. 
<strong>”Maybe-… I uh-“</strong> 
<strong>”Great! See you in a bit!”</strong>
Keenstreak trotted off happily humming. Sparrowfeather gave another defeated sigh. When was she going to stop getting into these situations?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="Pip#3325">@Pip</span> Pinefoot&#39;s life hadn&#39;t changed much since the other days. He was still the same ruddy brown cat, his fur now a bit thicker due to being further away from kithood than before. He was a rather impressive looking feline, even more so now that the cold and barrenness of winter had shaken itself away from his fur. He moved around the camp with a small twitching smile on his face, nodding at Clanmates he crossed paths with, being a rather friendly young tom with a desire to prove himself in ThunderClan. 

Rubbing his head, he caught a conversation on the wind- and he did remember the voice of Sparrowpaw. <em>Sparrowfeather</em>, he reminded himself now, having some trouble recalling that the apprentice he used to hang out with was now the same rank as him. And it hadn&#39;t even been that long ago, did it? He wondered why he had never bothered to speak to them since that one fight.

Well, they were going hunting anyway. Maybe he could step himself into their small patrol, claim that more cats were better than two- and besides, he planned to step out of camp at that moment anyway. With a nod of his head addressed to himself, he padded up to Sparrowfeather. 

&quot;Hey.&quot; he said as a small greeting, not waiting for a response before he launched into his reason for being there. &quot;I heard you were going hunting, yes? I planned to go out myself- but more cats are better than one, wouldn&#39;t you say? If you&#39;ll take a third Clan member along, I&#39;ll be willing to join the pair of you.&quot; 

He wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of running into Keenstreak again, but it didn&#39;t matter. He just wanted to go hunting, maybe keep an eye on them in case they did anything a bit strange. Besides, solo hunts got... lonely sometimes.</span>

Hers hadn’t seemed to grow out at all, in fact it was still thinning out. He looked older too. Which made Sparrowfeather mildly self-conscious of the fact she still probably looked like an apprentice. Her brow raised in surprise as Pinefoot so casually walked up to her with a flick of his tail. He wanted to join their hunting patrol? Sparrowfeather could barely contain her surprised look. 
<strong>”Yeah… of course you can join!  Keenstreak is slow anyway”</strong> she gave a small nervous smile. 

She didn’t want this conversation to end and she didn’t feel like asking any big or saddening questions that might make Pinefoot uncomfortable… like their fight- or the fact that he might not have showed up for her warrior ceremony. So she stayed on a more familiar topic. <strong>”Your crow finally likes me.”</strong> 
Sparrowfeather blurted out.
<strong>”Oh- also I got tired of calling it a crow so it’s name is Clo now.”</strong> 
Sparrowfeather straightened her posture. <strong>”I mean- you can still name them something else- you just didn’t seem to keen on a name..”</strong> her sentence drifted off into silence. She missed being able to talk to him casually- not in this forced and uncomfortable way she felt. <strong>You haven’t see anyone near the border, have you?”</strong></span>

</div></div><em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Marigolddust was quite relieved that Leappaw had failed to notice certain things in his demeanor and held himself, such as his sheepishness and uncertainty.  Such were habits he had yet to shake, although he hoped that he could figure out a way to avoid them sooner rather than later.  They were tiring and annoying, and always made him seem and feel weak, although it also kept him from being intimidating and often lead him to be quite easy for other cats to approach, if they decided to approach a cat with the title of Medicine cat, that was.  He was aware that some didn’t, nervous around cats that had higher ranks in respect than them.  He would have felt the same, if the medicine cat before him hadn’t been his best friend since they were kits.  Leappaw, on the other paw, seemed to think along the line of a handful of others, not seeming at all nervous around him.  It was quite a relief, if the stormy furred tuxedo were to tell the truth.  

                       At Leappaw’s comment on Marigolddust’s hunger, the medicine cat paused for a moment, only now realizing that his stomach <em>did</em> feel fairly empty.  With the realization, he found his stomach threatening to grumble.  He hadn’t eaten as much food since the landslide due to the sickness that had broken out afterwords, the habit growing from his attempts at pinpointing whether or not the illness came from the prey they had.  He hadn’t quite broken it yet, but it have grown to merely become something he often forgot; he would go throughout the entirety of a day with only having had one meal at times, forgetting that he could starve more often than not.</span>

                     <em><strong><em>”I guess I might be a little bit hungry,”</em></strong></em> he noted, before glancing back up at Leappaw and the morsel of prey between his jaws.  A gracious smile spread across Marigolddust’s features at Leappaw’s kind offer, and at his rather amusing suggestion that followed suite.  <em><strong><em>”Well, thank you.  It’s really appreciated, but you can lend a hand either way, if you wish to,”</em></strong></em> he said, motioning to the food and then back to the apprentice I’m front of him.  Albeit the fact that the tom was quite hungry, he didn’t wish to be rude by claiming the whole meal, especially since Leappaw had been the one considerate enough to offer him the prey.  Marigolddust examined the other tom, and as he listened to the other feline speak, he found himself feeling quite amused with the apprentice.  

                   He definitely had some energy, and he liked to talk, too.  Marigolddust was used to this, having had had Wrenfrost as an apprentice, and he found it to be quite an enduring trait.  This familiarity of the situation seemed to assist him in speaking smoothly and fairly confidently, too.  <em><strong><em>”Nothing much, I don’t think.  I’m just not used to giving myself free time, always fussing around herbs and such.  I thought I’d give myself a break today, although, I don’t think I’m very good at relaxing,”</em></strong></em> he admitted with another chuckle, uncertain as to whether the sound was meant to be as uncertain as it sounded.  

                  <em><strong><em>”Who can sit still the longest, hmm?  I mean, I can sit pretty still for quite awhile- I’m not sure if you’d stand a chance,”</em></strong></em> he joked.  He hadn’t realized that he would find himself so much more comfortable with Featherpaw this quickly than he was with most anyone else, more than likely due to how much of Wrenfrost he saw in the tom.  They were so similar, except it seemed Featherpaw didn’t hold quite so many anxieties, and might have been a little more aloof, too.</span>

                        Hesitation came after Featherpaw’s next words, brought upon the two by Marigolddust’s lack of certainty in the statements.  It was true; medicine cats usually didn’t get much action, at least not anywhere besides their own den and Starclan.  But in those places, quite a lot happened- births, injuries, deaths, knowing conversations, prophecies, healing, and more.  Except, it wasn’t exactly the action Marigolddust suspected Featherpaw meant.  Finally, he decided to break the short moment of quiet between the two.  <em><strong><em>”I get some action sometimes, although not quite so much of what you’re thinking about.  And actually, I have- I would never mess with Specklerose,”</em></strong></em> he mentioned, before leaning forward and dramatically whispering to Featherpaw, <em><strong><em>”She’s a little scary.”</em></strong></em> with a paw next to his may, as if covering his mouth from being seen by wandering eyes.  It was a joke, of course, although he was still quite intimidated by the fem.  Marigolddust made that clear with his tone and dramatic gestures.

He chuckles in a rather cordial manner. “I would believe he is. The old cat’s getting on in moons, ain’t he?” He purrs. He was going to leave the conversation at that and just wait for them to head off, but he should have expected that Sparrowfeather would have more questions. 

“Ah, the crow? You can keep them, if they finally like you.” He says with a touch of disdain in his tone. “They kept messing up my hunts- and besides, I don’t think they liked whenever I would go after their own kin. If you’re willing to deal with it, go ahead. As long as I get to see it sometimes.” He smiles. Really, the bird had still been around- but not as often, and therefore it wasn’t on his mind as often as it used to be. “Besides, you named it. You definitely feel stronger towards it than me.” he meows. 

“By the border…? Not really. You looking for somebody specific?”</span>

Sparrowfeather paused when responding. She couldn’t help but catch a mild bitter and impatient tone from his words. Maybe she was imagining it, but better to act on it than not. <strong>”Thanks, Pinefoot- but ya know, it is a wild bird neither of us really own it”</strong> She meowed, happily noticing that he was at least smiling. <strong>”Dont worry about it- you would know. Forget I said anything”</strong> She smiled back, standing up and walking away. <strong>”Im going to find Keenstreak and Sandstride! Hold up!”</strong> 

She trotted away, smiling. However doubt clouded her mind. Pinefoot must not have thought about being friends as much as she did. As much as it pained her to admit, maybe being friends again isn’t such a good idea. He seemed…different. Something had changed. Maybe Sparrowfeather just needed to figure out what. She yelled out for Sandstride and Keenstreak around the camp- only bumping into her mentor to happily tell him that Pinefoot would be joining them. She thought she saw his face cloud over in disappointment but then it was gone. And she’s naturally paranoid so she didn’t think anything else of it.</span>

Maybe we can give it a warrior name sometime.&quot; The brown cat understood that his mannerisms in this conversation were rather different from how he used to talk to the young warrior- and while he wasn&#39;t completely sure why, he also didn&#39;t know how to fix it. 

He nods. &quot;Sandstride is somewhere else at the moment- I saw her head out. Not sure if we&#39;ll run into her while out there.&quot; he admits. &quot;But the three of us should be fine. It&#39;s smaller than the official patrols, but it&#39;s not a bad number of cats.&quot; he muses, thinking for a moment about how much prey he usually saw solo cats bring in. 

&quot;If you want to head out now, we can.&quot; he says after Sparrowfeather told the older warrior. &quot;Or we can wait for Sandstride to come back in.&quot;</span>

She really wanted Sandstride to have her back on this excursion but… Pinefoot and Keenstreak were impatient and ready to leave. Though Pinefoot offered to wait. Sparrowfeather thought it was simply out of curtsey, one in which Sparrowfeather wished he wouldn’t show- supposedly because they were supposed to be friends. 

She shook the thoughts away. <strong>”Its okay, I’m sure she’s having fun- not as much as we’ll have of course!”</strong> she meowed, flicking her ear. <strong>”We can head out now.”</strong> she said shortly, making her way towards the camp exit. Keenstreak found it natural to bump his way in front of her. She let him, rolling her eyes and looking back to see if Pinefoot was following.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">An elusive form slipped into the heart of the forest dwellers home. He was not often seen within the bramble walls of the camp unless mandatory for patrols or deposit prey upon the fresh kill pile. The warrior, how ever capable, had no apprentice assigned to him nor did he have anyone he&#39;d consider himself especially close with. Despite being raised alongside many of his denmates, he didnt even share the den space with them. His old nest had long been tossed out or moved in to by now.
Ever since the battle with the Dark Foresters, the tom had sought out a small, solitary shelter for the rest of his nights deep within Thunderclans territory. Under twisted roots, there was a nest for one tucked away and hidden in shadow which served as his own den. It was entirely unsafe to house alone, he knew this, but he found himself unwilling to reintegrate with his peers for fear of disrupting what ever amount of normalcy they had achieved in his wake.
Besides, he really wasnt meant for sleeping amongst so many bodies with all of his tossing and turning and mumbles. Not to mention the night terrors that had managed to wake nearly everyone at least once a night during the nights proceeding the battle. So, yes, sleeping in solitude was best for everyone at the end of the day.</span>

He&#39;d turn around and scurry right back out into the wilderness like a shadow fleeing the sun, careful to avoid the High Ledge as much as possible. He could still see the blood dripping off of it...
Dustycloud shuddered at the thought before setting himself back on track. Today would be different from his usual routine because he was going to <em>talk</em> to someone, maybe even make a friend if he got lucky enough. The issue was, the heavily scarred feline wasnt exactly sure as to how one would go about making a friend. Starclan knew it had been quite a while since he&#39;d actually tried to. He lingered by the fresh kill pile, his one-intact ear burning with embarrassment at his own social awkwardness before hasitly retreating to a shaded spot near the edge of camp. He sat down, puffy tail curled close to his side as he waited for... something. <span class="mention" title="Soopest#7555">@Soop</span> (meant to start this sooner but work got crazy yesterday <img loading="lazy" class="emoji " alt="😭" title="sob" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f62d.svg">)</span>

    The morning had been pleasant so far; the harmonical aubades of the early birds during dawn were a soft, euphonious greeting to a new day. The sun took no time to climb high up in the zenith, blue skies a vibrant sheet powdered with the gentlest clouds, looking to be made of the smoothest silk. Everything seemed perfect today — well, at least that&#39;s what went on in the little, easy-to-please mind of Vanillakit, a polite little cat who seemed to enjoy the little things in her everyday life. Now at five moons old, she simply enjoyed the innocent, relaxed bliss of kithood while she could, though was hardly convinced that her upcoming apprentice ceremony next moon was a particularly bad thing.

    Now nearing noon, the wild scents of the oak trees and floral aroma of wildflowers clustering at the edges of camp delighted the little one&#39;s tiny nasal cavities; she bathed her body in the warm, welcoming sensation of the sunlight on her starkissed back, multicolored eyes gazing fondly upon the camp as she ran out to play. Palesheen had granted her access to the wide world of camp two moons ago, and Vanillakit was determined to explore every nook and cranny, surprising herself every day with new things she found, like a chrysalis of a monarch butterfly or a shiny pebble. She had even made a friend or two, apart from her dearly loved siblings. Similarly, today she was out to complete her objective of aquiring a new one.

    Her sweet, innocent eyes, so round and clinquant as ever, traced camp curiously, paws skip-hopping on the ground jovially as she made her merry way through camp. Just as she was about to begin her daytime routine with a small wood mouse for breakfast, she spotted a cat lounging near the prey pile, looking quite tense and awkward for a feline that was not currently occupied with a duty or conversation. Friendly as ever, she padded over.

    <strong>&quot;Good morning, sir!&quot;</strong> Vanillakit mewed politely, little ears twitching and soft tail flicking as she stood in front of the taller tom. Being five moons old, she was almost as tall as a young apprentice, finally having contracted a growth spurt — but she still had to look up upon the warriors as they had the upper paw in the category of height in her conditions. <strong>&quot;Might I trouble you with a wee bit of conversation?&quot;</strong></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Blue and amber eyes watched as this pale little form approached him without a second thought. He worried briefly that her guardians hadnt properly enlightened her on the premise of stranger-danger. Before she even opened her mouth he was looking beyond her at the rest of camp, mismatched gaze seeking out worried parents or queens. But then he remembered: He wasnt a stranger, he was a clanmate. Or at least he was supposed to be. It unnerved him, the sudden realization that alienating himself so far had begun to take its toll.
He almost didnt hear when she began speaking. <em>Sir?</em>
Dustycloud blinked down at her, surprised at her diction. He had to stop himself from looking around again, wondering if she had mistaken him for someone else. But then again, who could he ever be mistook for with scars like these? It was true, as he sported a ripped ear, a mark against his temple, two large slashes across his face, another winding around his left foreleg and even a bite mark complete with neatly set puncture wounds. 
All gifts from the Dark Forest. 
He averted his gaze to the ground between them, overcome with the desire to leave but he stayed put only for fear of offending the kitten before him. She shouldnt have to look at someone that looked so completely like patch work. But then she spoke again, expectant for a response. He found himself meeting her gaze far easier than expected- kits were always easier- before he offered what he hoped to be a convincing grin. <strong>&quot;I-&quot;</strong> He cleared his throat, hoarse from disuse, <strong>&quot;Sorry, uhm, y-yea sure if you want to.&quot;</strong> He patted the empty space next to him, purposefully inviting her on the side with the least amount of scarring.

At least with someone younger there was all the chance that she <em>hadnt</em> heard all the rumors about his instability.

    Being a kitten with quite an observant, mild nature, Vanillakit was prone to making friends with just about anyone she ran into, save for the occasional feline who despised younger cats such as herself with every fiber of their bitter being. Unlike some, Vanillakit was not one to nip at your ankles or beg for demonstrations of battle moves; being more interested in critters and plants, the small tabby was prone to a more gentle approach, preferring a piece of casual conversation. She was quite the mature one, making it easy for her to converse with warriors; even more timid and awkward ones such as Dustycloud.

    <strong>&quot;Splendid!&quot;</strong> Vanillakit purred, taking a seat to the left of the chocolate felid. She curled her small tail as much as she could around her undersized, dainty mitts. <strong>&quot;My name is Vanillakit. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you in camp much, sir. Your eyes are definitely a nice thing to see, as I happen to have an odd pair myself.&quot;</strong> She grinned jubilantly, pale yellow and blue gaze looking up upon the speckled warrior curiously. Her eyes traced the ragged scars criss-crossed across his figure, but she paid no mind to the like of it. In fact, she rather admired the look of the leathery lines where past wounds healed — it was a nice reminder of this particular cat&#39;s bravery and courage in battle, willing to put himself in the way of any danger that could possibly put ThunderClan in jeopardy. But, choosing to act respectfully, she did not speak of it just in case Dustycloud was uncomfortable around the topic. <strong>&quot;Anyway! What&#39;s your name, sir?&quot;</strong></span>

The young tom was indeed very eager. Always taking initiative for training and helping around the camp, but even though he already did his best to be helpful, he couldn&#39;t help but crave more.. He wanted to lead patrols, fight in battles, and go on hunts all on his very own. He was eager to learn as much as he could as quickly as possible so he could become a full Warrior of Thunderclan. He truly didn&#39;t understand why training has to take so long. Perhaps if he continued to show his eagerness to learn and trained as often as possible, he could become a Warrior much earlier? He could only naively hope.

At the sight of the older molly, Raccoonpaw excitedly bounced up on his paws with a bright grin on his tiny muzzle. <strong>&quot;Good morning Laurelstar!&quot;</strong> He greeted, seeming unable to stand still as he shifted from paw to paw. The moment she confirmed they would be going, he gratefully purred and wasted no time in following her, but not before curiously following her gaze up to the sky. Only when he looked at the golden sky did he realize that perhaps he might have come for training a little too early? Laurelstar didn&#39;t seem to mind however, so he quickly brushed it off.  <strong>&quot;So what are we doing for training today? Will I finally be a warrior when we finish?&quot;</strong> He couldn&#39;t help but ask as he followed his mentor closely, his attention all on her even before they headed out to the territory. This question was one he tended to ask often. Any little thing he did or accomplished, he thought that was enough to become a Warrior. But he would learn in time that his thoughts were foolish and completely wrong. It took much more to be a Warrior, yet he still didn&#39;t seem to understand at the moment.

He followed them- not at the friendly closeness of friends, but in a respectful manner that most cats on patrols would assume. He stayed at the back, sometimes coming closer to look around, but for the walk he stayed towards the tail of the group.

It was rare for any apprentice to be promoted to a warrior earlier than usual, unless they conducted a feat that was exceptional for their age; Something worthy of granting them their warrior name. Laurelstar herself didn’t receive her warrior name of Laurelblaze early, she was old enough to have been promoted to a warrior like usual, she had just proven herself in a major battle that it superseded the need for a proper warrior assessment. She had proven her loyalty through protecting her clanmates and fighting to bring their kidnapped leader home at the time, though she truly doubted something like <em>that</em> would ever happen again. She refused to be taken hostage <em>ever</em>, they’d never take her alive. Besides, it seemed rather pointless considering an entire clan would come after her seeking to rescue her. She was their leader, they were loyal to her. Besides, that battle was rather petrifying for her at the time, she’d earned quite a few scars during it.

His head was racing towards the future, and she felt like she was mentally clothes-lining him by trying to slow him down. He couldn’t learn everything he needed in the span of one single day, no one was <em>that</em> talented. <strong>”Easy there, Raccoonpaw. You’re already going too fast and that’s only gonna cause you problems in training. You can’t rush your training, it might actually slow you down in the long run.”</strong> she rested her tail on his shoulders for a moment, her voice growing stern as she looked down at him. Her gaze was hardened, focused, she did not want him to fail, she wanted to ensure he got the best possible experience out of his training he possibly could. She wanted to make sure he would be all right, that he’d be able to protect himself once he became a warrior.

<em>I don’t want him to end up like the others. I can’t lose another apprentice, I don’t want him to meet the same fate as they did.</em>

What he didn’t know, is that most of her apprentices had either disappeared or perished. Only one of them who even reached warriorhood was alive, the other, Tigerspring, had lost her life in the battle against Silentwing’s forces right after she was promoted. Her very first apprentice, Applepaw, had perished in a fire, and Dreampaw had vanished one day. After all these experiences, she was fiercely protective over her apprentices, Raccoonpaw and Bouncepaw, the two pupils she had under her care currently, had her undivided attention. She had to ensure they would be careful. <strong>”Trust in me, Raccoonpaw, I know you’re excited, but please just take my advice. You’ll know when you are truly ready, just be careful. Pay close attention to everything I say, and you’ll be okay. Got it?”</strong>

<em>He’ll be okay. I’ll make sure of it.</em>

</div></div><em><strong><em>- Close Future -</em></strong></em>

Grey clouds covered the entirety of the late-day sky, like dirty sea foam blanketing the surface of the pure blue waves of the ocean that Marigolddust had only heard stories of.  Despite the fact that the end of the day was slowely dawning on them, coming closer as the minutes ticked by, and the thick layer of precipitation tried its best to block out any sunlight that threatened to peak through, the warm rays appeared to win the battle.  Everything was still bright, as if it were midday, rather than mere hours away from the setting of the sun that was so well hidden behind the wall of greys.  As the slowely crawled out of Leaf-bare, New-Leaf seemed to make the days bleed on longer and longer, providing the forest clans with more sunlight than starlight.  Even the gatherings and moonpools had seemed to grow a little bit short with the change in the length of the daytime and nighttime, or had been squedueld at earlier times than they would have been if they had still been trudging their way through the climax of Lead-bare.  

                       In this newfound sunlight, the fairly large, steady-falling sleet that sprinkled down onto the fur of the medicine cat, that of which was fitting enough in color to sink into the clouds above his head without much difference in color, only a shade or two darker than the billowy wisps above him, landing carefully on his forehead and quickly bleeding into his fur.  He let a small shiver pass through his spine.  It was a decently warm day today, with much higher temperatures than they had experienced in earlier moons, but the chill still clung to the land around them, and it stubbornly kept thin snow layers coating the ground, and seemed to still cling to the falling droplets that only got the chance to threaten to become pull water droplets, rather than a mix of ice and water both.</span>

                        It was an odd type of weather, that was for sure, but Marigolddust needed some air.  The stench of herbs had begun becoming stronger in his den now that the weather was getting warmer and offered the plants moisture, rather than dry cold.  The air was humid, and humidity didn’t do well at preserving his herbs, he found.  Recently, he had had to dispose of larger amounts of herbs, but he also found himself finding more of the herbs that had been absent from his den for too long.  He found himself visiting the meadow often, and recently, when he set his eyes of the grasses that began to peek out of the mounds of snow that had gathered throughout the cold season, he could spot some flowers peeking out, too.  He was excited for when he would have an easier time gathering what he needed, and, for the first time in his entire time as the medicine cat, he would have a rather easy time finding the herbs he needed, such as goldenrod, which he could identify without assistance, having had learned about it during his time with Fernpaw.  

                    <em>Perhaps I’ll visit the meadow again today and see if any of the herbs have fully grown yet.  I should try to pick them early, so that my store can get larger faster,</em> he thought.  Maybe he could try something to dry them out, too- perhaps hanging them up with cobwebs in the sun would work?  He had heard of the tactic before, but he wasn’t sure just how useful it was.  Well, no matter, he would discover in time, he hoped.

Her faraway look flickered back to life and she turned back to Laurelstar who seemed ready to fight off any adversary that showed itself. 

<strong>” Everything is alright,”</strong> Iceheart quickly assured, hoping that Laurelstar’s rising hackles would relax back onto her broad shoulders. <strong>” I just…”</strong> Her voice died, unsure of how to describe the feeling. <strong>” I felt something strange.”</strong> As this might be taken in the wrong way, she quickly added: <strong>” Not in a bad way. It just felt foreign as if it was coming from somewhere else.”</strong> 

Perhaps she was crazy but the Clan had gone through wild events. It was unlikely that she would be ruled out as odd, especially considering the legacy she had left as ThunderClan’s leader. It was a protective thorn barrier during such a vulnerable time.  

<strong>” Do you think Featherpelt is watching over me too even if I don’t remember him?”</strong> It was a sudden question that had latched onto her when Laurelstar was describing his passion to adopt every kit he laid his eyes on. He seemed like he was such a caring individual. Did that mean he would still care about her even if she didn’t know him?

Not everyone was snoozing away in their dens. A small, slim shape lurked in the shadows of the quarry walls. He was careful to not let the moonlight touch his silver-brown fur. His steps were clumsy but the loud buzzing of the crickets masked the noisy mistakes he made. The tabby paused, familiar sea-green eyes focusing on the relaxed deputy that lounged in the far side of the camp. His guard was down and this was Seakit’s opportunity to strike. 

The apprentice-aged kit crouched down and wriggled his shoulders awkwardly, attempting to remember what his father, Bearmask, had taught him. Another glance was stolen towards Alerceclaw. <em>Still distracted,</em> he thought with relief. Another sturdy wriggle was given before Seakit burst out from the darkness and scampered right towards the thorn tunnel. If he disappeared quickly enough, Alerceclaw might not notice.

This time of year was always awkward with it’s transition into a sunnier, warmer environment. No longer frigid outside wherever she stepped, the zephyrs that coursed through their territory were not present. They had moved on to wherever else they planned to torment, however it still wasn’t necessarily <em>warm</em> out. A chill could be felt in the air, especially now that a freezing mixture of rain and ice was present, gently drizzling. She had parted the lichen curtain that guarded her den’s entrance, but her head recoiled back for a moment as she felt a droplet hit her nose all of a sudden. She blinked quickly, whiskers twitching as she stepped back out into the fray, no longer caught off guard by the sleet. The ThunderClan sovereign stepped out onto the ledge that led out from the cavern where she resided. She then carefully descended the boulders that led up to her den like stairs, her gaze sweeping across the various dens and figures she could make out from where she stood. It wasn’t long before she spotted an oh-so familiar face in camp. 

<strong>”Up and at ‘em, Marigolddust?”</strong>

Her lighthearted laughter filled the camp as she approached her friend, her clan’s medicine cat. She wondered if he was going to conduct a survey for herbs out in the territory, now that the weather was changing. She could have sworn she spotted some harbingers of spring cropping up in the forest, the first sign that new-leaf was upon them. The early-season flowers always were a good indicator that things were changing, that warmer, easier times were upon them. Laurelstar would have to ensure her clan was ready and keeping their prey stores well-stocked. Now that everyone in the clans would be able to feed off more prey, it could inspire other clans to get greedy. They could try to take territory that wasn’t theirs in order to gain more of the fruitful bounties they provided. They would have to be vigilant for any threats that may come in the future. Including their medicine cat, best she did check up on him to ensure he would be fine. He may have been trained as a warrior firstly, but he had been training as a medicine cat for moons, he might have gotten rusty. <strong>”How are you doing today? Got any plans for later?”</strong>

The confirmation of everything being all right, that nothing was wrong, caused her to relax once again. She let out a sigh of relief, a calm smile replacing her alert expression that she once wore. She didn’t want to seem like she was infantilizing the other she-cat, but she was also genuinely a jumpy type. Laurelstar was always alert to danger, a possible threat would not be tolerated in her presence. She reacted fast, ready to sink her claws into anything that posed as a source of danger to her clan. No foe would get the upper hand over her, she was well-prepared. 

No one harmed her clanmates and expected to not face her fiery wrath.

The russet-toned femora flashed the familiar lynx-point a curious expression, harmless skepticism in her gaze. <strong>”How strange, as long as you’re feeling okay, I’m sure it’s all right.”</strong> her brow quirked, and she curled her tail around her paws. She hadn’t felt anything change around her, though in Iceheart’s case, all sorts of strange phenomena happen around her. She couldn’t put it past her if it happened again, maybe they could help her after all that had happened. She deserved the help after everything she had done for the clan, for her. There was hardly anyone more loyal to ThunderClan than Iceheart, besides herself, but she’d just be tooting her own horn. <strong>”I’m sure he is… No, I’m positive he is. He’d look out for anyone, stranger or not. He was just that type of cat.”</strong> she had corrected herself, and a warm feeling flooded her chest. Her father had granted her one of her lives when she went to the Moonpool to be named as the leader of ThunderClan. He was kind, he always looked out for others, he didn’t have a selfish bone in his body— even if he didn’t possess one anymore. <strong>”And there are others who are here who are looking out for you.”</strong>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">Again, Dustycloud could only blink. He was taken aback by the kittens direct and confident nature. He followed her movements closely and somewhat curiously, though made no move to inch closer, as though afraid to accidentally invade her personal space in any capacity. Was this how kits were supposed to act? No, surely she was an outlier, though a very welcomed one. He sat with his plush tail curled tight up against his side and his pale paws fidgeting below. He gazed down at her and, to show he was listening, his one good ear pricked forward. Especially at her use of the term once again. <em>Sir.</em> It really didnt fit him. 
He was distracted from addressing it, however, by the words that surrounded it. The warriors gaze flitted away from the kitten for a moment as the mismatched pair was acknowledged. They were his mothers eyes,- both biological and adoptive- stuck between a deep, frigid blue and the warm glow of a flame. It was the part of himself he had always admired most; the one part he could never hate. It was like he could carry this fragment of them no matter where he went.
The rest of him, however, was full of muddy tones, like dirt and sand churned up in a current of twoleg runoff. These colors were his fathers.</span>

He cleared his throat and made conscious effort to hold eye contact longer than 2 heartbeats and, to his surprise, it wasnt so hard. He watched her eyes trace around his scars, finding the movement grounding despite the ever present worry she would <em>ask</em>. She didnt, thank Starclan.
<strong>&quot;Dustycloud.&quot;</strong> He answered, clearing his throat again though the response came easier. <strong>&quot;And, uhm, you really dont have to call me...</strong> <em><strong>sir.&quot;</strong></em> A flash of concern struck his gaze, as though worried he&#39;d offend the young tabby. <strong>&quot;O-Or if you want to you can, Im not bothered! I just, uhm, I just mean you dont have to is all.&quot;</strong> A nervous chuckle escaped him as he rose a paw to rub at the back of his neck in an anxious gesture. He hung it there as he continued, applying pressure to his nape as though to physically anchor himself to the spot. <em>Breathe. Keep talking.</em>
<strong>&quot;Uhm... yea, I-Ive got a little place on my own right now.

    The little stellifer&#39;s gentle gaze was interlocked steadily with Dustycloud&#39;s own of a similar hue. His anxious nature despite her mild outward demeanor caused her a little bit of sympathy for the flecked felid; from the way he behaved around others, it seemed that he was unsure how to react to everyday conversation. With his previous statement, about distancing himself from the rest of the camp, Vanillakit assumed he didn&#39;t get spoken to much, or, similarly, didn&#39;t make an effort to talk to others. Though she wasn&#39;t like that much herself, Vanillakit could understand that — people could be exhausting. Some could be very judgmental or volatile for seemingly no good reason, which may be the case for Dustycloud; that he was afraid of recieving the harsh judgment some cats could give. But that was why Vanillakit never gave them the attention they so desperately wanted, the reaction that would boost their fragile ego and maybe make their lonely lifestyle all worth it in the end.

    She smiled as the tom seemed to untense, if only a little, as he spoke. It always made the little one happy when cats felt comfortable around her. <em>Dustycloud.</em> She finally recieved the tom&#39;s moniker. It was a name fit for his pelt of a similar manner — not dusty or dirty, but rather resembling the brownish color of dust or stray grains of dirt. It could be viewed as cute, but also cruel to be named after such a nuisance. However, Vanillakit just seemed to like the name regardless of its intentions or origin. <strong>&quot;That&#39;s a wonderful name. Dustycloud....it has a nice ring to it!&quot;</strong> she assured him kindly, raising a paw to shift her flower crown back in place quickly that had gone askew. She was growing fond of this tom quickly.

    She chose to focus in his statements in the order they had been made. For the thing about calling Dustycloud &quot;sir&quot; — she got that a lot from some warriors she would encounter. It was a polite way to address someone, at least in Vanillakit&#39;s vocabulary, and it was an obligation to her, but it didn&#39;t burden or irritate her at all. But, of course she would cease immediately if they so wished her to do so. <strong>&quot;Oh! My apologies, Dustycloud, I wasn&#39;t aware of that; I don&#39;t mind doing it at all, but if you don&#39;t like it, I will stop.&quot;</strong> She grinned, moving on to his next statement. <strong>&quot;I see. I can get why a lot of cats would like to keep to themself. I bet your den is cozy.&quot;</strong> A pause. <strong>&quot;Dustycloud, do you ever stargaze?&quot;</strong></span>

The grey-furred tuxedo found the back of his mind again urging him to return back to his den and hide from the icy precipitation that found itself landed on his thin fur presently, but he kept his paws cemented to the camp stones.  He didn’t want to let getting a little wet distract him from the warming weather, weather that he had been awaiting for moons by now.  Finally, it seemed the warmer parts of the year were beginning to peak over the horizon, blessing the forests with their beaming rays of warmth, even if such hearth had to be seeked out of the uneven drizzle.  The indecisive droplets soaked through his rather thin fur and into his skin with ease, and, for a moment, he found himself almost listening to his head and hiding back inside of his den.  The longer he sat out in the weather, the more he began to realize that weather such as this might mean sickness, not only for himself, but for others as well.  He doubted he’d get sick from it very easily, nor most anyone else, but the kits and few elders of theirs couldn’t help but come to mind.  They were more liable to falling ill, even if he coldest weather had passed by now.  

                      He didn’t want to let down his guard.  He wanted to start off New-Leaf with a head-start and an easy-going stride, not a panicked one searching for ways to heal the weaker of their ranks from sickness brought by icy weather.  His thoughts came to a pause, though, as he took notice of what was going through his head.  Sure, the ideas were very probable, but only if those said ‘weak’ members of the clan decided to hang out in the sleet for an hour or two.  He doubted much of either categories of young or old would stray out in weather such as this, even if it did turn out to have higher temperatures.  Not many cats liked getting wet, anyhow.  It was quite amusing, how his mindset had changed throughout these past moons as medicine cat, albeit a little terrifying.</span>

                      Large domes perked as Marigolddust heard approaching pawsteps, ones with more weigh to them than the average cat.  They were fairly orderly, although also a little bit more relaxed than others Marigolddust had noticed.  It wasn’t at all tricky for him to identify the pawsteps and who they belonged to, but he looked over to welcome his friend with a glance anyhow, just as she spoke her greeting.  He sent her a smile and a respectful dip of his head as she arrived at his side.  The expression was more confident and relaxed than it usually was around other cats since Fernpaw’s absence, having been earned through quite a number of heart-to-heart situations the two had been through.  In fact, he found himself completely relaxed- or, that is, as relaxed as one could be while in such chilly rainfall.  <em><strong><em>”Hey, Laurelstar,”</em></strong></em> he said, retuning the greeting with a gentle sway of his tail and a soft expression.  The leader’s laughter was nice to hear- it was definitely a good change from the serious and grieving stage she had been going through when she had first earned her new rank.  

                       He was aware of the fact that she had been efficiently getting better the further along they went into the moons after the Dark Forest battle, but he couldn’t help but think that the coming of New-Leaf could have meant something, too.  He felt as if it might have been lightening the mood in the clan as a whole, representing new beginnings and future memories that smelled of honeysuckle, rather than metallic crimson.  Hopefully it would continue on from that even after New-Leaf passed. <em><strong><em>”Im doing well, I think.  Happy for the change of weather, even if that sounds a little.. ironic at the moment.”</em></strong></em> he said with a small chuckle, one that felt like it came from a tom far older than he himself was.  He paused at her last question, taking a moment to think before he spoke again.  <em><strong><em>”I’m brainstorming,”</em></strong></em> he admitted.</span>

For better or worse, everything that Thunderclan had gone through a few moons ago had changed him. He&#39;d grown to know that things could be shattered in an instant under the right circumstances, everything that he knew and loved could be taken from him within moments, the very world could change so quickly, it was almost unbelievable. Such things had happened to him and others, though it had caused everyone to grow a little and perhaps develop a skill or trait that would make or break them. Featherpaw himself had gained such - despite the fact that his leg had never healed properly, it had ignited a flame within him - a flame of determination. He&#39;d grown closer to his family and had developed a deeper protectiveness concerning his clanmates - thus the reasoning why he checked up on Marigolddust.
    The tuxedo tom-cat was the only medic they had. And he&#39;d seen with his own eyes what burdens did to another. His mother, he could tell, that something has changed within her after the war - though he wasn&#39;t sure what, he knew something wasn&#39;t the same anymore. He wasn&#39;t sure if the same thing applied to Marigolddust exactly - but he knew that he was dealing with a lot, he always seemed so busy and there wasn&#39;t anyone who regularly helped him out. It was a little disheartening to see, but perhaps he preferred it that way - after all, some cats were like that. But he, for one, wanted to show the medicine cat that he appreciated his efforts and would always be available to lend a paw should he need it, even despite their differing roles.</span>

    <strong>&quot;Well, only if you&#39;re certain! But you&#39;ll have to take the first bite.&quot;</strong> Featherpaw replied with a singular nod toward the prey he&#39;d brought the medic. He could easily hobble over and get himself something to eat, anyway. What point would he have made if he brought something over, only to devour the thing? Which he wouldn&#39;t necessarily do, but since he hadn&#39;t eaten yet it was a possibility that he wasn&#39;t about to risk coming to pass. Not only would that be embarrassing, but such actions would be more than disrespectful.

His ears twitched at the medicine cat&#39;s words and he nodded along. He could understand that - or at least, he thought he could, but maybe he couldn&#39;t. In any case, being a medicine cat sounded quite complicated - he was the only cat in the clan with knowledge on how to heal the ill and injured, and all that stuff about herbs he knew to - at least, to Featherpaw&#39;s knowledge. And that was an admirable feat on its own, he figured. He didn&#39;t think he&#39;d do well in such a position, especially since his mind liked to wander so much...forgetting he had a patient - or patients - wouldn&#39;t be a good look for a medicine cat, he was certain. When the tom spoke once more, it shattered his thinking, his gaze flickering back to him as he caught onto the last of his words. <strong>&quot;No? Do you need more practice then? You&#39;ve got to be driving yourself crazy if you don&#39;t relax! Or at least...every once in a blue moon.&quot;</strong> he replied, chuckling. Though, he had to say - he couldn&#39;t imagine simply carrying on with his warrior duties without to the extent Marigolddust tended to his herbs and healer duties. Though he&#39;d much prefer to be out more than he was, he couldn&#39;t imagine going to that length to tend to his own duties.</span>

    <strong>&quot;Really? You&#39;re probably right though, I can wander without thinking sometimes - besides, I get pretty fidgety when I sit for too long, I&#39;m already a little limited as is, so why bother limiting myself further, y&#39;know?&quot;</strong> Featherpaw responded with a smile, tail flicking towards his lame leg, which rested in a particularly awkward position, at the moment. It certainly had made things quite different for him, but now that he&#39;d lived with it for some time, he&#39;d gotten used to it and was more or less able to make do, even if he did look awkward doing so.

Featherpaw&#39;s knowledge concerning medicine cats was quite limited so to speak - though he probably knew a bit more than the average apprentice thanks to being confined to the medical den due to his leg for some time, though then again, he hadn&#39;t paid all too much attention to the clan&#39;s medic all the same. Though Featherpaw was glad to hear that the tuxedo tom had some excitable moments even so - what was life without any thrill anyway...so long as it was within reason. The tom&#39;s ears twitched at the mention of Specklerose and they remained erect and attentive as the medic paused, raising a paw toward his maw as he lowered his voice. Featherpaw leaned in curiously, whiskers quivering at his words. This Specklerose character didn&#39;t sound very nice, whoever she was. <strong>&quot;Really? She didn&#39;t cause you any harm, did she? I&#39;m sure one of us warriors can take care of her if she dares to show her face again.&quot;</strong> he replied, blue optics flickering over the camp as if she might appear at any moment. <strong>&quot;I would myself but...I&#39;m not a very good fighter.&quot;</strong> He added after a moment, sheepishly.

<span class="mention" title="Shade#2140">@Shade</span> 

Wolfprowl&#39;s companions regarded the vibrant calico&#39;s display with equal parts bewilderment and disappointment, turning to the masculine as if expecting him to discipline Scarletpaw on the spot. Scarletpaw held her ground as Wolfprowl halted leering down his muzzle, paying little interest to those warriors on either side. When her mentor acknowledged her with only a blunt response her tail began lashing in frustration and she stomped one paw down harshly imagining the grey masculine&#39;s tail. Did Wolfprowl believe Scarletpaw would crouch passively by while he continued neglecting her and her training? We&#39;re Dovebound still here, she&#39;d have Wolfprowl&#39;s hide the apprentice was certain. Dovebound wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve permitted even Thunderclan&#39;s sovereign to turn a blind eye to such mistreatment. 

<em>&quot;I don&#39;t think so. Not with them you aren&#39;t…</em> <em><strong>We&#39;re</strong></em> <em>going out.&quot;</em>

Scarletpaw&#39;s demand was delivered matter of factly as she wedged herself between the accompanying warriors and Wolfprowl, glaring daggers into them should they lay a paw on or speak a word to her. She would show Wolfprowl what she was learning without his dung-poor mentorship observing her denmates and their own mentors, following close behind without ifs, ands, or buts. The calico roughly shoved his shoulder aiming to prompt him forward wordlessly toward the thorn tunnel.</span>

The cream toms face fell, his disappointment clear in the pout on his face. His na&#239;ve little mind was filled with the fantasy of being a great warrior, it truly made it hard for him to understand that this would take a very long time to accomplish. He was willing to put in the work towards his goal of becoming a warrior but he questioned if it really needed to take so long? He just couldn&#39;t understand it, not one bit.

Raccoonpaw looked up to meet the hardened gaze of the molly, the pout on his face quickly disappearing at the sight of her focused expression. The sternness in her voice really nailed it into his head that she really was serious. After a few seconds of stubborn staring, he finally sighed in submission, deciding not to argue with his mentor. The last thing he wanted was to argue with the feline who has so far showed him so much kindness. Laurelstar was his mentor after all, and he truly did trust her. However, the disappointment he felt still didn&#39;t go away. Was it really going to take so long just to be a warrior? 

He looked sheepish as he lowered his head, trying to hide his disappointment from the leader. <strong>&quot;Oh alright...I trust you. If I pay attention I&#39;ll for sure become a warrior, right?&quot;</strong> He asked to confirm, a smile suddenly spreading across his muzzle as hope filled his bicolored eyes. Like whiplash, his whole demeanor changed back to one of an excited kit, as he leaped forward and turned to face Laurelstar. <strong>&quot;Then you can trust that I&#39;ll do everything you say, no problem! No rush, nice and slow~&quot;</strong> He boasted with excitement. The apprentice may be saying this with confidence but he still secretly held hope that the life of a Warrior would be meeting him much sooner.
Perhaps Raccoonpaw would have to learn some lessons the hard way.

Leaf-bare had been a hard season on her. While she didn’t show it to her clanmates often, the leader had her dark moments in private, shielding them from a cracking exterior. She was thrust into this role upon the transition between leaf-fall into leaf-bare, having to cope with losing the cat she held closest to her heart, and the loss of so many lives of her clanmates, her friends. She wept in the dead of night, where no one could hear her from the privacy of her vast, lonely den upon the Highledge. Times where she was trying to relieve the unbearable stress she was under, just so she could wake up and face the next day ahead of her, to appear strong in front of her clanmates and to inspire hope from them where despair otherwise would have taken root. She had to be their beacon, the light they turned to when they needed her most. She had to be their source of strength and inspiration, she was the leader of ThunderClan.

She can’t betray weakness, not when they were watching.

Even with the weight of the world on her shoulders, she still stood tall, her usual expression of joy on her features as the medicine cat caught onto her voice and returned her greeting. There was mutual respect here, they did not speak in formalities or address each other in reverence, this was a conversation between close confidants. <strong>”Ah well, leaf-bare always seems to throw a tantrum about being kicked out. That’s what this rain is, I suppose.”</strong> a quick flicker of her tail tip towards the pallid skies above their heads indicated the subject of which she spoke of. She couldn’t explain why it always rained before the pleasant weather of new-leaf truly began. She wasn’t able to explain most phenomena that occurred. These were just a part of the natural order of life, in leaf-bare it always snowed, in greenleaf there would be heat waves, life would continue on. There wasn’t anything they could do about it, so why spend time pondering the meaning of the rain? <strong>”Brainstorming what? Does this have anything to do with your duties?”</strong> she didn’t mean the latter part of her sentence as a jab at his work ethic, she was truly just curious as to what was causing the gears to turn in his mind. What had Marigolddust <em>brainstorming</em> in the middle of camp this early in the morning, and could it possibly result in something fruitful? Might as well ask so she could possibly assist in any matters that he might need help with.

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">His pale-toed paw slipped from his nape and arose near his chest, paw pads facing outwards. It was an expression of something noncommittal and surrender-like, a signal that he truly didnt mind the oddly formal title. Although, in hindsight, it likely made him appear more startled than anything. <strong>&quot;I-Its alright- either way is fine.&quot;</strong> He assured her hurriedly before quickly clasping his jaw shut so that the younger feline may speak once more without interruptions. His paw settled on the ground where it returned to fidget with the other quietly.
The warrior found himself running out of replies, as though his words were tallied and he was only allowed so many per day. <strong>&quot;Mhm.&quot;</strong> He hummed a quiet response, nodding to confirm the assumed truth within her words. In his opinion, his tiny living quarters were more cozy than any of the dens ever had been. They were too open and too crowded. There was also the extreme lack of privacy and the knowledge that his denmates would occasionally vacate the area in order to get sleep. In the end, he really couldnt blame them, for it was his own nightly habits that made them do it. 
Night terrors were difficult to sleep through for everyone involved.
To some, his own den may be considered a bit claustrophobic and, well, a bit dusty. It was nestled beneath tangled oak roots, exposed from moons of erosion by the weather and clan cats alike. Dustycloud suspected that his homely hole in the ground had been the start of a predator&#39;s- likely a fox or badger- den or burrow, but had either been killed or driven from the territory before they had ever finished. In some ways, he pitied the creature who&#39;s home he had claimed, but he was more grateful than anything. Without its efforts, he would not have the cozy, albeit solitary, hideaway that he does now.</span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">As an easy and surprisingly not uncomfortable pause stretched between them, it was once again Vanillakit who spoke up in place of him. His head tipped slightly sideways at her inquiry, a close-lipped grin causing the corners of his eyes to crinkle for a moment before it shrunk again. Something struck behind his eyes, a light and a memory that knocked him back out of his shell a bit more. <strong>&quot;I-I do, actually... a lot. Do you?&quot;</strong> His nod was a bit sheepish as he spoke, as though it were embarrassing to admit he spared Silverpelt a few glances from time to time and, in a way, it sort of was. He spent more time with the stars, whether in sleep or in wakefulness, than he did with any one cat of his own clan. But he needn&#39;t tell the tiny tabby at his side as much, lest she decide to take some sudden pity on him that always managed to make him squirm almost as much as anyone&#39;s cruelty ever could.
He seemed to come back to himself after a few heartbeats, realizing he had lapsed into an unplanned silence. His gaze trailed to his unscarred forearm as he presented it to Vanillakit, the freckles dancing along his appendage reflecting his namesake. He made sure his claws- although already sheathed- faced away from her. His movements were slow and deliberate, for he didnt know the mollys background in the slightest and he was not intent on sending a kitten into a breakdown should it be anything like his own.
<strong>&quot;My mother-&quot;</strong> He began, only after glancing to her to ensure she was alright did he continue with his eyes fixed on his own arm again, <strong>&quot;-er, my first mother... she had a saying about the stars. She said that- sometimes- on nights of a new moon or when theres not enough stars in the sky to shed any light, theyll come down to the ground and find a queen. They&#39;ll ask her if her kits, the ones still in her belly, are allowed t-to help them.&quot;</strong></span>

Was it a common saying amongst the kittypets and loners or was it something his own brilliant mother crafted of her own volition? He wasnt sure. He continued. <strong>&quot;If the queen agreed, the star would take the kittens souls and put them high up in the sky with the other stars, just for that night. She said that every freckle o-or small spot was where our own light had shown through ourselves, making the fur spotty and pale.&quot;</strong> He explained and by the end of it his quiet voice had relaxed enough to allow some warmth to flow from his tone. He nodded to his own forearm and then vaguely gestured to her own freckled pelt with a small grin. <strong>&quot;Looks like we both did some light work.&quot;</strong>

</div></div><em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Featherpaw wasn’t the only one to take notice of the change in almost every cat in the clan after the horrible events they had gone through this season, and it seemed that he was well aware of it, almost as much as Marigolddust was, if not just as much.  Unlike Featherpaw, Marigolddust had taken some pushing to really take notice of the fact that he wasn’t the only one who had been affected by the landslide and the battle.  Sure, he was aware of the fact, much he hadn’t felt the true level of sympathy until he had taken on his role and such became his job.  Eventually, Marigolddust heard the stories of dozens of cats, been a shoulder to cry on for the majority of them, and had assisted them in making their way through it.  Laurelstar was an example of this.  It was true that he had only really had one time where he had assisted her emotionally in a way clear enough that it was impossible to miss, but that one time had seemed to lay off.  He was ever thankful for how much his words had seemed to impact her, often thanking Starclan that they had given him the right words to say.  

                      Being as apprehensive and uncertain in himself as he was, he often stumbled over his words or couldn’t find the right ones.  Yet, in that particular situation, he hadn’t messed up and ruined anything.  He was relieved that his voice had been strong enough to convince Laurelstar that she was the leader that the clan needed, rather than a cat that would only make things worse for them.  Personally, Marigolddust held similar problems and doubts, and he still possessed such, although there had come a time where Laurelstar had paid back the favor, helping him through it.  Even so, the faint paint still consistently made his chest tighten, especially when he thought of who and what he had lost over the past moons.</span>

                 Looking at a mother watching over their kits reminded him too much of Rooksnap, and almost anything reminded him of Fernpaw, so a break was hard for him to access.  He often sought a release for it through some small things, mainly.  He had quickly become a workaholic, which he had never been much of before.  Even when he ran out of work, he would keep his paws and mind busy in the fear that he would see, smell, hear, or taste anything that brought him back to those times, often resorting to heavy decorating of his den when he ran out of work to do.  

                      <em><strong><em>”I’m certain,”</em></strong></em> the tuxedo verified with a smile, before taking a glance down to the prey and then back to Featherpaw.  With a bit of a spark of amusement dancing across his expression, Marigolddust bent down and took a modest bite of the meal, before straightening for a moment as to allow Featherpaw to join him if he wished.  <em><strong><em>”Well, we can eat it together now, then,”</em></strong></em> he said, curling his tail  around his paws as he took another bite, retreating once more to take a moment to savor the warm flavor of the meat and the conversation both.  His amusement formed into a different, more hesitant breed at what Featherpaw said next, uncertain how exactly he should respond.   <em><strong><em>”Every cat works their tail off once in a while.  I’m always hanging around in one area, anyways.  More often than not, I’m just sitting in one place, so that could be considered relaxing.  Plus, I don’t have to get up as early as you and the warriors do,”</em></strong></em> he pointed out with a small smile and a twitch of an ear.  He listened as Featherpaw continued, and responded with a small, mellow shrug.  <em><strong><em>”I don’t mind.  It’s good to get some energy out, I think.  Especially with fidgetiness- it can get much more annoying than it’s worth, for me, at least,”</em></strong></em> he said.</span>

                    Marigolddust immediately straightened, a small moment of surprised panic washing over him as he realized that he had given Featherpaw the wrong impression on the Skyclan medicine cat.  <em><strong><em>”Oh, no, no, no- she’s very nice.  She just has the type of intimidation a strict mother might have with her children.  I can’t see anybody in their right mind talking back at her, is all I mean,”</em></strong></em> he said hurriedly, suddenly feeling his features turn hot with embarrassment.  Starclan, perhaps he should have clarified a little bit more on the topic.  With a bit more of his bashful and nervous appearance back, Marigolddust released a small, awkward laugh.  <em><strong><em>”Oh, don’t worry, I’m no good at fighting either, even after being a warrior.  I’m not sure why I was allowed to continue onto that rank, anyways,”</em></strong></em> he said jokingly, although he had begun to rub his paw pad of his single milk-touched mitten against the cold soil beneath their paws.

    At his hasty assurance, Vanillakit&#39;s eyes shimmered, a wide grin presented upon her countenance. Clearly, no matter what Dustycloud talked about, Vanillakit was just happy to have another individual to talk to. Such things like awkwardness or a bitter attitude clearly didn&#39;t preturb her. <strong>&quot;Right then, sir! My wish is your command.&quot;</strong> She bowed jokingly, glancing up at the speckled tom. Then, she sat up straight again.

    Then, the statement about his small home outside camp. His reply looked as if it pleased Vanillakit — she hadn&#39;t been outside camp before and that was one more place to add to her list of exploration sites, if he would allow her. She was curious as to what he slept in or upon, since ThunderClan&#39;s convieniently large bushes and boulders made for easy shelter; how could she know it was the same outside? She hadn&#39;t yet been appointed her apprentice name nor a mentor to accompany her outside. So, for the time being, Vanillakit could only imagine how tall the trees stretched out there and where all the flora and fauna liked to rest, staring at the horizon like an old friend. <strong>&quot;That sounds nice,&quot;</strong> she said after a slight pause, mismatched eyes trailing off to the side near the camp&#39;s bramble-coated exit. <strong>&quot;I&#39;ll have to take a look sometime. If you&#39;ll allow me, of course.&quot;</strong> She gave him a tiny nod courteously.

    Next, stargazing; a concept Vanillakit was very familiar with. Often, Vanillakit would encounter bouts of restlessness before bed — being a young cat of her age, she was prone to having extra energy that she did not know how to expend — and she would tiptoe from Palesheen and her siblings&#39; nest and sit near the nursery exit, nearing the edge so she could lean forward and rest her innocent eyes at the endless ocean of stars overhead. Vanillakit often wondered what it was like for the StarClan cats to live up there. Knowing how beautiful and breathtaking the sky was at night, she had a feeling they never tired of it. It made her a bit less scared of when she would ultimately pass away, her soul ascending to the heavens above. Another pause from the molly occurred, as if she had just snapped out of a bout of deep thought. <strong>&quot;Yes, I suppose you could say that. I enjoy looking at it at night when Mama and all my siblings are asleep.&quot;</strong>

    The story Dustycloud chose to tell her was one that was clearly up the tabby&#39;s alley — having a gently starkissed pelt of her own, the thought of the stars from the sky she admired so dusting her back from caring for them made her starstruck. <strong>Wow,&quot;</strong> she breathed, eyes wide. <strong>&quot;I can&#39;t believe <em>I</em> was chosen to substitute those stars. They really thought I was radiant enough...how wonderful is that?&quot;</strong> she asked, awefully.</span>

Laurelstar couldn’t fault the cream-colored tom for believing things could come so easily to a warrior. He was raised a kittypet, brought to their clan by hers truly and allowed to stay. He wasn’t taught about the hardships they faced, not like a kit who was born here, or at least born out into the wild would know. It wasn’t innate for him, but she prayed eventually he would learn. He seemed so crestfallen that the tortoiseshell’s gaze flashed with a shred of pity for him. She didn’t <em>want</em> to disappoint her apprentice, but she also had to be realistic in what he should expect from training. <strong>”Most certainly, just follow my lead and keep working hard, and you’ll be a warrior in due time.”</strong> she nodded, his hopeful expression making her feel a bit more optimistic about today’s training session. She’d just have to pay special attention to him, considering at his age he’d be three moons behind on his training. They had a lot of catching up to do, in a way she was already trying to expedite his training as much as she possibly could <em>without</em> rushing him too much.

<strong>”Let’s go then, while there is still daylight. We have a lot to go over today, so please pay attention to absolutely everything I say.”</strong> her bushy tail swayed behind her, and she turned around towards the camp entrance behind the pair of felines. She began to saunter off towards the woods, leading him out of camp through the tunnel that led into their humble, repurposed quarry. She had an agenda today, they had to follow it if he wished for true success in his training.

</div></div><em><strong><em>- Close Future -</em></strong></em>

Laurelstar was good at hiding her emotions until she was out of the public view, keeping her troubles to herself until after she hid in her den once more.  Marigolddust had noticed that, ever since she had become the leader, Laurelstar had spent more alone time in her den, although it seemed that such time of seclusion wasn’t large enough to catch much attention from her clanmates.  Marigolddust might have fallen for it himself, that was, if he wasn’t already so aware of what she was going through.  It was hard to forget the day where he had been tending to her wounds in her den and she had broken down, like a vase that had been filled well past the brim.  Even now he could still see hints that the surface of the vase was beginning to crack under the pressure.  He had assisted her then, and although he had been decently successful, he wasn’t sure how to help her with the ever-present pain that came from all that she had gone through.  

                    He could relate to quite a lot of the things that he knew she was going through, since they had both been unexpectedly given their ranks in perilous events and didn’t think they were prepared for roles such as what they were given, but they pulled through anyways.  They had both lost loved ones, too, including Icestar, who Marigolddust felt had truly died after the battle.  This cat who called herself Iceheart felt more like a hollow shell to him, a cat who wasn’t exactly the leader that they had once had.  He and Bearmask had been trying all leaf-bare to return some of her memories to her, but it had never worked.  It seemed as if she was a different cat altogether, and they should leave her and her lack in memories alone.</span>

                      But perhaps he was giving up too easily.  She was a clanmate and a patient- he shouldn’t have felt inclined to give up on her.  So why was he?  The trauma and stress he had experienced throughout the past seasons stuck with him, and the losses he had gone through kept running through his mind in a consistent loop.  He had lost Rooksnap, his mother, all but two members of his family, and Fernpaw.  What was stopping Starclan from taking Iceheart, too?  Perhaps he just found it easier to think that the leader he had grown so fond of had passed that day, going to join Starclan rather than being stuck down here, confused and scared, with a medicine cat who was no use in helping her trying to force her to get through progress.  He was nothing but gentle with ever suggestion and action, but every time that she turned her gaze to him, bewildered and defensive eyes that had once been familiar green-blue pools, his heart always rammed against his chest, eager to try to heal some injury that it only made worse.  

                      Recently, though, Marigolddust had tried to ease up a bit.  He wasn’t so consistent with trying to bring back Iceheart’s memories, letting her re-learn the life of a warrior, rather than a previous life of hers that might have no affect on her anymore.  Eventually, perhaps he could befriend her again, or strengthen the friendship that had seemed to fade from sight.  But for now, he would keep that calm and relaxed composure, and try not to worry too much about her.  A smile bloomed across his features as he nodded in agreement to the tortoiseshell’s statement.  <em><strong><em>”It seems to, so far, at least.  I wish it would just pass it onto New-Leaf instead,”</em></strong></em> he said, sending a quick glance skyward and towards the field of grey clouds overhead.</span>

                  He made sure not to let any cold drops fall into his eyes or into his ears- it was simply too cold, and he didn’t want to have to deal with that increased discomfort.  He wasn’t a fan of this type of weather.  He wasn’t even sure if he could consider it better than snow.  It came faster, and soaked into a cat’s fur with more ease than a snowflake did, leading to his temperature decreasing at a faster rate than it often would have, like he was being splashed by the droplets of freezing stream water from a cat who couldn’t help but shake it out of their fur with such disorganization after a swim.  <em><strong><em>”What?”</em></strong></em> he repeated, taking a moment to realize his words might have been misunderstood.  Or he had misunderstood the words of the fem, he wasn’t sure.  <em><strong><em>”Oh, just thinking of whether I should visit the meadow sometime today.  And yes, for duties… mainly.  New herbs should be starting to bloom at this time, I think,”</em></strong></em> he explained, not exactly uncomfortable with being honest with Laurelstar, since he was well aware that she knew quite a portion more about his own struggles than others did.  He wouldn’t have been surprised if she was aware of his frequent trips out into the territory on a search for Fernpaw, or it could have failed to catch her notice.  Either way, he felt she might be able to connect the dots, or she would ask him.  He didn’t mind either one too much, as long as no unwanted ears overheard.  Plus, perhaps part of his mind was distracted with something else, such as his future lesson with Otterpop.

It was one of their favorite games to play, giving them an excuse to be nosy and strut with importance, which the white she-kit did so very proudly at the head of her ginger and black siblings.

They all had their soft pink muzzles dug into various young fronds when Palekit gave a dramatic gasp. <strong>&quot;I smell something!&quot;</strong> she hissed, adopting a prowling stance and beginning to stalk with narrowed eyes, slicked ears, and bristled fur towards a fallen log which hid her imaginary target. She flicked her tail to signal Lionkit and Everkit follow suit.

Icey blue eyes watched the other kits from afar in mock amusement. The fact that the kits of traitors were playing patrol in his clan was hilarious to him, as if they would ever be in charge of something as important as a patrol. They were all mouse-brained. The longer he watched the more his mock amusement turned to annoyance, a nasty hatred building in his chest until it finally burst. He couldn&#39;t watch this anymore.

He was gonna put a swift end to this foolishness.

Birchkit approached the three kits, an annoyed scowl on his face. <strong>&quot;What do you traitors think you&#39;re doing?&quot;</strong> He asked with an accusatory tone to his voice. He eyed them with pure hatred in his cold blue gaze. He still couldn&#39;t understand how these kits are still in their clan, especially after what their parents had done only a few seasons ago.

<em>Not on his watch</em> 

The young tom had been watching the shenanigans of his adoptive siblings with great interest and joy- all of which was washed away with the bile of disappointment that his biological littermate dragged through the dirt with him. 

The once soft verdant stare of the marbled tabby tom narrowed with a defiant and bold look. If his brother wanted a problem he was more than willing to have one. 
<strong>&quot; Really, Birchkit? Are you naturally this dumb or do you have to put in the extra effort?&quot;</strong> the tom openly rolled his eyes. <strong>&quot; Last I checked, no one died and made you leader. You don&#39;t get to choose who is and isn&#39;t a traitor-&quot;</strong> The kitten puffed out his chest and pursed his lips to the side of his face in a pensive look. The tom baffled him- his adoptive siblings were crimeless. They had no part in whatever it was their parents had done.

The rain wasn’t exactly something that perturbed the thick-furred leader. Whenever she did decide to venture out of her den into the precipitation she could remain out there for longer than someone else with a thinner pelt. She might end up looking like a drowned rat afterwards, but she didn’t exactly pay much mind to it. It was water, not acid, she didn’t melt upon coming into contact with it. Laurelstar wasn’t a sugar cube. If she ended up with the sniffles the next day as a result, it was her own decision. She made her nest, now she had to lie in it. Though it wasn’t that bad today, to her the light pitter-patter of the rain felt more like mist to her anyways. It was nice, she enjoyed the rain. Though she did hum in agreement about his wish for the seasons to just transition into slightly warmer weather already. She’d have to respectfully disagree about greenleaf, however, she had a particular hatred of the sun during that time of year. A feud she had with it ever since she grew into her thick tresses of russet, ginger, and white fur.

Twin irises of honey-amber and sea-blue wandered over towards the camp entrance for a moment, resting on the ferns and brambles that guarded the mouth of the tunnel that led into their home. A thought had come to mind, a possible venture she could assist the medicine cat with. Even if she was a leader she wasn’t too uppity to believe she didn’t have to handle menial work. If he needed her help, she would gladly offer up her services. She had a code of honor, and all her clanmates deserved her attention. She just had to divide it evenly amongst the populace. <strong>”I can come with you, if you wish. I don’t mind assisting you in your search for herbs. You’d just have to tell me what they look like and how to harvest them.”</strong> she didn’t want to be careless and accidentally ruin a supply of herbs he needed for the season. Even if new-leaf was upon them, they still needed a good supply of herbs if anyone got sick, or, warrior ancestors forbid, injured. So many ways for people to need medical attention, so little time to gather everything they needed. It almost seemed like it was never enough, even if prey and medical supplies seemed bountiful in the warmer seasons. There always was a price to good fortune, they would have to err on the side of caution. Laurelstar still wasn’t sure how her clan could hold up in a fight if it came down to it, she didn’t consider most of the losses they sustained at the start of leaf-bare replenished. Even with many new warriors, they couldn’t replace an experienced, ready warrior… At the same time, however, she could not let her clan bow down to potential threats. Their pride and their honor as warriors wasn’t to be taken for granted, her clan was an old, powerful entity that had a great amount of history tied to its name. She would ensure they survived, her clan was not to be trifled with. If there was any way she could help prove her point, helping him could be one of them.

The fluffy tom was eagerly following his sister Palekit, enjoying the game they were playing. <strong>” What do you smell? Riverclan??”</strong>

Before he could say anything else, Birchkit appeared, with his snobbish attitude as usual. <strong>” Shut up Birchkit! I’m trying to play here.”</strong> Lionkit usually didn’t have time for the tom’s foolishness. Besides, with Lionkit’s  stocky size, he could definitely take him down .

Still, him being called a traitor was hurtful. Leechkit thankfully stood up for him, and he sent a warm look his way.
<strong>” You should listen to Leechkit. Buzz off before I eat your ears.”</strong>

</div></div><em><strong><em>- Close Future -</em></strong></em>

A curious interest tugged at Marigolddust’s large ears, causing them to stand tall with a calm type of alertness, listening intently to Laurelstar’s offer.  Truly, he didn’t mind whether or not he got much or her attention, or anybody else’s- as long as he wasn’t left without company for a whole day, that was, and as long as he could keep the friendships between himself and such cats in tact, even if he didn’t end up having much opportunity to meet and chat with them.  Recently, he had been experiencing such a thing with Wrenfrost, she being busy with her new warrior duties and him with his medicine cat ones, although she always made sure to come by and visit him often, nearly every day.  It was nice to hear her voice call for him at the vine-adorned den enterance, and he always looked for words to her next visit, prepared to hear about everything that might have been going in with her and the other warriors recently.  

                     He missed always being with her and being the one to tell <em>her</em> everything, but he was aware of the fact that he had agreed to this role, and therefore to the seclusion that came with it.  Even so, he sometimes felt like he was stuck in a pit, rather than comfortable in his own den, and had to be told everything that was going on in the world outside of his herbs, unable to escape and find such things out for himself.  He knew he had never really been interested in the events that occurred outside of his own immediate life, but as a warrior, he would at least hear vague mentions of certain things that were going on.  As the medicine cat, such a thing proved to be trickier to get ahold of.</span>

                      What wasn’t so hard to learn about was all of the political views, opinions, and actions from the other clans, all things he had previously wanted to avoid as much as he could.  He didn’t like worrying about what clans thought about one another, or what negative interactions they might have had or would have in the future.  But, he assumed, this was mostly his fault as well.  He would have never done chosen anything besides becoming the medicine cat in the situation they were presented, and he didn’t regret it.  It gave him lots of work to do, but he often practiced such work a bit too much, keeping himself cooped up and away from everyone else.  It helped to scare away the emotions he wanted all so dearly to avoid, but also meant that he hardly knew anything that was going on in his clan, besides the few times he forced himself to go out and get a breather, such as today.  And, it seemed, he would get a break from that workaholic nature he had become used to, and hopefully, Laurelstar would, too.  

                      Marigolddust knew all too well how much of a workaholic she was, and could see it even as a kit, although he hadn’t quite understood it before.  Now he did, although he wasn’t quite so experienced with working as hard as Laurelstar always did.  But they didn’t need to think about that, not right now, when they were going to take a trip to the most comforting place in the territory to the tuxedo tom; the meadow.  Of course Marigolddust would say yes- the opportunity was once made in kindness, and he would enjoy the company.  <em><strong><em>”I think you coming with me is an amazing idea, thank you.  I don’t mind directing you at all, either, if you don’t,”</em></strong></em> he said with a small laugh, subconsciously running through all of the herbs he would need and how to harvest them, just to make sure he didn’t accidentally direct her incorrectly or misguide her in anything.  Plus, it helped him to remember what he needed.</span>

She could understand the isolation a promotion or change in rank may cause. When one was an apprentice or a warrior, they had others to rely on, cats of the same exact rank they could talk to, to relate to. Being a deputy, being a leader even, brought with it its own sense of feeling socially marooned. Only a few other cats knew of the responsibility it carried with it, and they belonged to other clans, not reliable places to air out frustrations to. She was not going to reveal her deepest secrets, her own weaknesses to those who could be sharpening their daggers in the dead of night, outside her view. She wasn’t out here to make <em>friends</em> with the other leaders, her clan came first over all. She could be cordial, but emotional attachment to those outside of her own clan, friendly or not, could be a slippery slope. She’d already made that mistake more than once, she had to tread with caution. She never knew when things could change instantly. That was why it was a rule in the warrior code, because there was always a chance she’d have to face off with a friend in battle.

She never wanted to subject anyone she truly cared about to her merciless claws. Thus, she kept a safe distance, she might have appeared friendly at a glance, but that was all, she was just keeping the peace.

<strong>”Let’s go then, before everything gets flooded out with mud. StarClan knows I already have enough trouble dealing with my fur.”</strong> she let out a small chuckle, long white whiskers twitching as she slowly stood up to her gigantic, bear-like paws. The behemoth gestured with her bushy tail for the medicine cat to follow after her through the tunnel that led out of their forest-guarded home, starting the slow trek out of camp. Her large skull breached the entrance, pushing aside overgrown ferns that gave way to her larger form. Since the refurbishments to their camp after the landslide, she no longer had to crawl through the once cramped and claustrophobic tunnel, now able to comfortably move in and out with ease. She was a giant, but she was also the leader of her clan, she could dictate that the tunnel should be able to accommodate her when she was leading her clan out of it. Maybe it was one little stretch in her authority over the others, but was anyone really complaining? She didn’t think so.

It was as though the memory had awoken something again, a long lost relaxed content for the world he&#39;d only felt in kithood. Even then, it was fleeting. Still, he couldn&#39;t help but smile as she took in his story looking both eager and inspired all at once. His dark button nose blew out a sharp exhale in equal parts of amusement and relief that she hadnt found it entirely boring.
<strong>&quot;Cool right?&quot;</strong> He chuckled softly at her wide-eyed expression, settling his pale paws back on the ground. Times such as these reminded him <em>why</em> he preferred conversations with the young and naive counterparts of the clan. They often lacked the likelihood to be as cold and cruel as his grown clanmates, nor the harsh judging eyes it took to complete the ensemble. Their world was still so full of color and wonder, things his own environment had long since beat out of him. Although, every so often it was resurrected in the presence of those who could still feel it. One may even mistake the feeling as something envious, though it was hardly that. If anything he was only glad that at least someone was still able to reflect on the pure chaos and unpredictable nature of <em>everything</em> and still find love and contentment over it all. The former of which he had already accepted that he&#39;d never experience beyond something platonic. Alright, perhaps it was envious... but just slightly.
<strong>&quot;S-So now, when you star-gaze, you c-can say that you were part of Silverpelt, t-too.&quot;</strong> Dustycloud chirped, shuffling his paws a bit. <strong>&quot;Do, uhm, do you have any stories about the stars?&quot;</strong> He prompted her, curious to see if her own mother had granted her any great tales as well. <span class="mention" title="Soopest#7555">@Soop</span></span>

</div></div><em><strong><em>- Present -</em></strong></em>

Perhaps, in some terms, Marigolddust and it easy.  Unlike with friendships between leaders and deputies from different clans, the medicine cats were encouraged to get close to one another, to form bonds that couldn’t be severed by any actions of one clan against another.  The medicine cats were kept out of the clanly business, albeit the rare occasions that a clan broke a rule and brought action onto a medicine cat.  The healer was relieved that he was able to befriend all of the other clan medics, and he wasn’t sure what he would have done if he had to be worried about receiving threats by them.  

                      For leaders and deputies, though, they had to be more cautious.  They were the opposite of medicine cats, politically considering.  They could form friendships, and he had noticed quite a few had, but they were the head of the drama in and between the forest clans, along with those outside.  He couldn’t blame Laurelstar for her reluctance towards forming friendships between the other leaders and herself, especially after everything she and Thunderclan had even through, even if he didn’t quite understand the full story of what and why she felt the way she did.  The Dark Forest battle and the betrayals they had experienced during it were a large reason, he assumed, but assume was all he could do.  He didn’t wish to prod her for more information for his own clarity and knowledge.</span>

                   Laurelstar’s chuckle was returned by a smile from the tall tom, before he stood and followed behind her through the now fairly wide entryway- or exit, in this case- of the little Thunderclan haven.  The new amount of open room in the pathway was quite a change, although it was subtle, but he was slowely getting used to it.  At first, it had felt odd, and he had been worried it might collapse, as he worried about nearly everything.  But, of course, it hadn’t.  The only large change that the action brought upon the clan was allowing their largest members to pass into and out of the clan with ease, that group of cats mainly being taken up by Laurelstar.  Soon, the two were out in the forest of their territory, and Marigolddust sent a glance over to his friend and her rather naturally messy fur, too long to be much ease to clean, he assumed.  <em><strong><em>”Do you ever wish for shorter fur?  I know I have done the contradicting, but I know you’re on the opposite spectrum,”</em></strong></em> he said, his voice curious as he awaited an answer.  

                       He didn’t often wonder what it was like to have fur that wasn’t as short as his own, only when he imagined how nice it would be during the cold seasons.  But he was aware of the cons, too, such as extra weight in water, extra heat in the warmer seasons, and extra self grooming.  His curiosity was strong enough to prevent any awkwardness from creeping into his tone of voice- or, more likely, Marigolddust had merely become used to Laurelstar’s presence, growing comfortable with her.  It was quite mind blowing whenever he tried to remember what their relationship was like when he was an apprentice, a bundle of nerves and bashfulness whenever he had been approached by the once-deputy.</span>

                        Now, he spoke to her almost as clearly as he had with Fernpaw, although the friendship he felt to them both was different, in a way.  Both bonds had a different type of taste to it, both sweet, yet with different types of sugar added to it to give it a different appearance.  He was guilty to admit that his relationship with Fernpaw was sweeter than that of his with Laurelstar, although his didn’t quite understand why, considering the fact that he felt like Laurelstar was one of his closest friends, just as Fernpaw had been.  

                    Suddenly, a single moon-painted mitten landed on long, soft grass with small blooms poking from in between the blades.  Aiming his sight upward, he was welcomed by the sight of the meadow.  <em><strong><em>”Oh, we’re here,”</em></strong></em> he announced, although it was likely clear to the both of them already, considering the fact that Laurelstar had been ahead of him in their trek.

    Still awestruck, the small she-cat could not get the story out of her head. Her eyes were big, twinkling with the light of the sun and the pure joy the anecdote had wrought upon her. It took a moment for her to process it all, her eyes looking to the ground as she drifted back into her own mind, glancing over at the speckles spattered on her back. <em>I went up to Silverpelt and acted as a star...I was a star....how amazing is that? I&#39;ll have to tell Mama and my littermates about that later! They&#39;ll be so proud to hear that I was a star!!</em> Her smiled flickered wider, only for a fleeting moment, until a small, stuttery voice yanked her back from her euphoria. Blinking, Vanillakit looked back up at Dustycloud, looking confused for a second. <strong>&quot;Eh? S-Sorry!&quot;</strong>

    <strong>&quot;Do I know any...&quot;</strong> She repeated the question quietly to herself. She hadn&#39;t been told many stories by her mother much nowadays but her father always told stories to her when she got to spend time with him. Now that Dustycloud mentioned it, one story she was told when she was a few moons younger that she recalled all of a sudden.

    <strong>&quot;Well, there&#39;s this one story my papa told me a while ago...&quot;</strong> Vanillakit began. <strong>&quot;That sometimes, whenever our elders get too old and weak, their family in StarClan will invite them for a race up where they live in Silverpelt, to feel reju-..rejuvenated.&quot;</strong> The torbie went on, reciting what she could remember. <strong>&quot;And when they won their race, they break through the border between the living and the deceased and rest for a bit in StarClan.&quot;</strong> She smiled up at Dustycloud. <strong>&quot;So when they come back to their body, they&#39;ll see that they have a short burst of energy before death. So they can say goodbye before going up to StarClan again.&quot;</strong> She finished her story, then paused. <strong>&quot;Gosh, mine wasn&#39;t nearly as great as yours.&quot;</strong></span>

The white toms pelt spiked up as his brother&#39;s voice hit his ears. He whipped around to glare at him, hiding the hurt in his cold blue eyes with anger. Leechkit was his actual brother, shouldn&#39;t he be on his side? He didn&#39;t understand how his own kin could defend kits who appeared out of nowhere and took over their nest. <strong>&quot;W-Well nobody was talking to you in the first place! Go be a </strong>leech<strong> in someone else&#39;s paw! I didn&#39;t choose if they were traitors, they are simply natural born ones!&quot;</strong> 

Birchkit then looked at Lionkit, a taunting smirk curling on his muzzle. He approached the much larger fluffy tom, getting up in Lionkit&#39;s face. Even if the other could easily take him down, Birchkit would gladly use it against him. <strong>&quot;See Leechkit? They are so violent and threatening when all I did was ask a simple question. Go on then, eat my ears! Prove to everyone that you truly are a freak. Go on, I&#39;m waiting.&quot; </strong>He laughed and glared at Lionkit, waiting for a response while he flicked his ears tauntingly.

The tom’s fur puffed up in rage as Birchkit taunted him further. His eyes burned with anger. Despite being so mad, his voice squeaked like a mouse. <strong>” YOU DID NOT ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION!”</strong>

The tom felt like he was roaring, but in reality he was mewling like a baby.
<strong>” JUST WATCH! I WONT HAVE TO EAT YOUR EARS! YOU’RE SO ANNOYING THAT YOUR OWN MOTHER WILL EAT THEM!”</strong> His tail was lashing, and his teeth were bared. There was no way he could attack him now! How would it end?

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace">The kittens voice was high-pitched with youth but soothingly consistent. Even in her bumps along particularly long words, to which he only nodded encouragingly until she got it and pushed onwards. He found his dark and speckled tail, once curled tightly at his side like a loaded spring, relax against the ground loosely. 
It was a nice story and one he had never heard of and <em>no</em>, he wasnt just saying that to be kind. The warrior truly did enjoy it and the imagery his easily-activated imagination provided; old felines bound by aching joints and brittle bones in the waking world are freed to run joyously once again. They are sent back only for loose ends and neatly deposited back in starry forms free from pain.
He hummed thoughtfully once the story ended, but then her self-deprecating words seemed to give him reason to speak again. <strong>&quot;I-I thought it was great.&quot;</strong> He mewed in earnest. Instinctively a shrug rolled his shoulders up and down as he contradicted the opinion of another but his words remained. He thought for a moment, eyes flitting to the ground as though he were trying to gather his words. <strong>&quot;Stories... arent really meant to be, uhm... compared, I think.&quot;</strong> Dustycloud mewed at last, eyes still trained on the ground. <strong>&quot;I-Its like c-comparing stars. S-Some might be brighter, but theyre all still significant... i-in their own way.&quot;</strong> He wondered how many times he was going to reference the stars before he finally looked back to Vanillakit.
<strong>&quot;That didnt make any sense, did it?&quot;</strong> He blurted out, tone rhetorical and dry as he chuckled a little, suddenly feeling a bit embarrassed. <span class="mention" title="Soopest#7555">@Soop</span></span>

    Kaleidoscopic oculars directed toward the brindled feline once more, Vanillakit&#39;s cheeks peppered roseate. <strong>&quot;Aw, well...&quot;</strong> Her reposeful voice was quiet, highlighted only by the gentle shell-pink hues of bashfulness. <strong>&quot;Thank you. I&#39;m happy you liked it. My papa has quite the array of stories that he tells my siblings and I from time to time. It&#39;s not always that he gets to visit us and our mama in the nursery with all the work that he has to do, so...&quot;</strong> The freckled kitten&#39;s sentence trailed off, as Vanillakit was not sure how to articulate the rest of her words. Instead, she shuffled her pale mitts in the verdant blades of grass, her mind deciding to wander elsewhere as both parties fell silent.

    But, she quickly returned to attention as Dustycloud began to vocalize again, giggling softly at his lighthearted jest. <strong>&quot;I see,&quot;</strong> Vanillakit mewed after a pause, an air of thoughtfulness misted upon her voice. <strong>&quot;I really agree with you. Each is very different and interesting in their own ways. I&#39;m not sure why I felt...well, a bit like I couldn&#39;t compare. I guess my story didn&#39;t cause much excitement like yours did.&quot;</strong> A nervous chortle slipped out of her larynx. <strong>&quot;Well, anyways, thank you for telling me a story, mister Dustycloud. It was awfully nice of you. I look forward to speaking with you again soon.&quot;</strong>

One wouldn&#39;t define Featherpaw as observant, even now. Though, during recent moons, thanks to the hardships that Thunderclan had faced, the apprentice had become more accustomed to viewing and actually digesting the information placed before him, so things didn&#39;t entirely slip past him as they used to - though it was still a slow process all the same. And despite this newfound trait that didn&#39;t mean that it came without issue - for his days as a naive kitten had left him ages ago and now, it seemed as if the last traces of this nature were being swept away completely. The cruelties of the world weighed down upon him like the horrid weight that had crushed his leg, which never completely recovered. He was like his leg in a way - a crushed soul that had never completely recovered.
    At times, Featherpaw wished that he could go back to the days where he wouldn&#39;t catch onto anything, really. That he&#39;d live among the fantasies of his own mind, getting himself lost among his own thoughts until another came along to snap him out of his trance. It was something that Featherpaw had never really thought twice about - until now. And he wished he could experience it to the intensity he used to. It didn&#39;t happen as much now, as it did then and it wasn&#39;t the most ideal experience either when he finally did so, depending on the day. Though the dark-furred tabby remained just as cheerful in general, at times it was like his optimistic spirit threatened to wither away, leaving him feeling empty and hopeless. Leaving him feeling crushed.</span>

    During these moments, the tom had once again gotten lost among his thoughts and it wasn&#39;t until Marigolddust had spoken that Featherpaw&#39;s attention returned to the cat before him. A satisfied smile rested upon his face as the medic took the first bite, nodding a tad as he bent down to take a bite of his own. This was how things should be all the time - so relaxed, that one could spend their time sharing a meal with another, any day they wanted. But alas, times like these only came about occasionally and due to such, had to be enjoyed then and there, treasured, cherished.

As Marigolddust replied to the apprentice&#39;s words, the tom-cat grew thoughtful for a moment, before humming. <strong>&quot;Well, I suppose it is true that everyone works hard at some point. But I don&#39;t think you should make it seem like your own role is so little. Our roles are different so they have different requirements - but that doesn&#39;t mean one&#39;s better than the other or one works harder than the other. You might not be able to see it at the same time, but there&#39;s a whole lot of warriors in comparison to medicine cats, which should tell you something. It&#39;s not a role everyone&#39;s after, you&#39;ve gotta be someone special.&quot;</strong> He replied, with a smile. <strong>&quot;You&#39;re the one and only Marigolddust. Just remember to take care of yourself, is all I&#39;m saying.&quot;</strong>
    Featherpaw only wanted the best for his clanmates and seeing them doing anything less than good was enough to pull his attention toward them, even if he couldn&#39;t understand or know all their problems, he&#39;d at least be around to offer a smile. As the opposing feline carried on, he nodded a tad. <strong>&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right. It&#39;s always nice to get energy out, especially if you feel accomplished afterwards.&quot;</strong></span>

   Moments after he&#39;d spoken, the healer made a hurried reply, declining the idea of Specklerose causing any trouble. He chuckled a bit at the tom&#39;s statement concerning the molly, blue eyes bright. <strong>&quot;Ohhhh! I know what you mean. Mothers can be pretty scary sometimes, but they mean well. Most do, anyway.&quot;</strong> He replied, tail swaying about behind him. It was good to know the other medic meant no harm, otherwise he&#39;d have something to say should she ever appear near Thunderclan territory again.
<strong>&quot;But didn&#39;t you train Wrenfrost? She&#39;s a warrior now, so that means you had to be somebody. I think it&#39;s pretty neat how you&#39;ve trained an apprentice, who&#39;s now a warrior and you&#39;re a medicine cat now, on a different path but still contributing to the clan all the same. Someday, you&#39;ll be training the next medicine cat of Thunderclan, too. I think that&#39;s pretty great in my opinion, even if it was all a bit of a hassle.&quot;</strong> Featherpaw couldn&#39;t imagine training an apprentice himself one day, though perhaps the Stars would see fit in allowing him to share his skills with another someday.
